Simmons LLP

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,680
each of them has a unique view on

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,300
privacy not all of them are lawyers

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,940
and it's it's a really good way to kind

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,780
of look at well why is privacy uh why

18
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,699
are privacy policies

19
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,680
in the state that they're in

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,000
so

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,520
let's talk about that

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,140
um

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,479
we all know privacy policies are

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,299
problematic

25
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,979
here's why

26
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,080
the legal requirements for privacy

27
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,180
policies this is a tiny smidge of what

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,100
you were legally required to put in

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,259
privacy policies this is a wall of text

30
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,939
I promise the rest of the slides do not

31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,600
look like this

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,020
Emily do you want to start talking about

33
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,020
why we have to do this yeah sure thank

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,360
you and really great to be here um with

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,680
with all of you

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,079
um yeah so I I think that's um if we

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,460
kind of start with the basics you know

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,079
why why do we have them in the first

39
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,759
place what are what are the the legal

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,439
requirements

41
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,840
um and generally most privacy laws and

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm kind of talking more specifically

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,000
from a an EU and UK perspective around

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,880
gdpr but there's a lot of similarities

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,119
across um most privacy laws now they

46
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,440
require as as a sort of fundamental

47
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,879
piece of privacy compliance for

48
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,819
companies to be transparent about the

49
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,220
use of people's data

50
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,620
and what we've seen happening and and

51
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,300
evolving over recent years in Privacy

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,060
Law and we saw this with with gdpo and

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,239
that came into force in 2018 is that the

54
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,540
law is becoming more prescriptive about

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,140
exactly what needs to be in privacy

56
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,379
policies and that means you effectively

57
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,140
end up with a very long list of things

58
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,420
that some of which are set out on on

59
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,360
this slide that you need to include and

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
there's no shortcuts unfortunately in

61
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,959
terms of being being descriptive and as

62
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,099
a real challenge for companies to meet

63
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,200
the requirements to deliver all of this

64
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,420
information about what data that is

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,760
being collected how it's being used who

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,400
it's being shared with what rights data

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,760
subjects have and balancing that with

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,159
the requirements to be to present that

69
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,640
information in a in a clear ease easily

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,340
accessible

71
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,860
concise way and and I think we've really

72
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,840
seen that challenge

73
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,120
um you know get get harder over over

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,099
recent years

75
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,300
yeah

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,620
um Gabriella is is this the same

77
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,420
worldwide are we seeing this just in the

78
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,200
EU with gdpr what are we seeing

79
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,819
first of all hello everyone it's such a

80
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,500
pleasure to be here

81
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,260
um and I can say that we do see this

82
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,720
worldwide

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,060
we have been seeing a number of General

84
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,480
data protection laws taking inspiration

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,940
from the gdpr and being passed in the

86
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,319
past

87
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,280
um four years or so around the world I

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,040
can give you the example of Brazil which

89
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,659
passed a law called

90
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,299
um well abbreviated the lgpd and which

91
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,400
has very similar requirements in terms

92
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,079
of

93
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,600
transparency and a privacy notice that

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,040
you know quite granular and we are

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,300
seeing

96
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,500
um this uh notice requirements in in

97
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,020
literally every single law that is being

98
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,060
adopted or that is being discussed

99
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,100
currently and I think this also shows

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,180
that

101
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,479
um everybody agrees transparency is

102
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,000
extremely important

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,280
and

104
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,040
explaining to individuals how their

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,020
personal information is collected how it

106
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,560
is used where it ends up is actually at

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,080
the core of what we understand by

108
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,540
privacy so I think this is also what

109
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,639
makes this discussion this debate we're

110
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,940
having right now so vital because we do

111
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,040
need to find that sweet spot in between

112
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,380
this very

113
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,300
um granular requirements to disclose

114
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,000
information about how personal data is

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,259
being collected used and

116
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:23,039
to be direct and honest and concise and

117
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,560
provide that

118
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,840
um transparency that that's really at

119
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,440
the core of privacy as a right and so

120
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,139
Holly you're in-house and you need to

121
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,600
communicate all of this yes to your

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
users yes and you don't want to

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
overwhelm them right how it's it's hard

124
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,900
it's a challenge and a and a

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,460
um I think to build off of what some

126
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,840
folks have been saying here you sort of

127
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,340
think about even the most benign piece

128
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
of data we probably have or many of our

129
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,160
companies have which is an email address

130
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,020
for someone's customer account you've

131
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,400
got to talk about the fact you use that

132
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,660
for an account identifier if you're

133
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,280
going to delete your account or close it

134
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,840
what happens and why you need to make

135
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,479
sure that the account is secure we might

136
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,100
email you sometimes sometimes about your

137
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,300
account sometimes because we want to

138
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,280
Market to you and if we want to Market

139
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,780
to you then you start getting the errors

140
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,360
people care right I want opt-outs or if

141
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,800
you're doing custom audiences with

142
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Facebook or if you're then going into

143
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
um you know we don't do this but

144
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,979
certainly if you're a data broker you

145
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,720
need to be talking about that in that

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,940
pan but to get to the things people care

147
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,139
about you have to actually actually

148
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,660
cover all of it because we have a if you

149
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,039
don't say it you can't do it regime and

150
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,560
so to try to balance that I mean it's a

151
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,639
challenge

152
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,740
um but I think we owe it to our users to

153
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,419
to make it as clear as possible as we

154
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,220
can for them and so some tools that we

155
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,100
have used are putting important things

156
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,740
up top we've found that you know our

157
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,600
platforms those aren't familiar we have

158
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,240
wordpress.com we're home and proudly

159
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,000
power a lot of Citizen dissidents people

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,259
who are standing up to oppressive

161
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,479
regimes in other countries and so

162
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,979
it's really important for us to talk

163
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,960
about how we respond in law enforcement

164
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,400
demands and what it means to have an

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,960
anonymous account with us and what that

166
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,340
means to you and so we try to highlight

167
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,660
that and put that really at the top of

168
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,600
our at the top we try to use visual we

169
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
were trying to use more visuals later in

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
the year we're going to move to bat

171
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,699
um also trying to just have some short

172
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,900
Snippets

173
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,120
um there's something about the marketing

174
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,919
Communications we have we also have

175
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,080
tumbler as one of our properties and we

176
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,460
have something about there's a long

177
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,620
paragraph about the email thing I just

178
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,360
mentioned and at the end we just say

179
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,340
look and bold we're going to send you

180
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,900
some emails about your account you

181
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,880
camped out I cannot opt out of those but

182
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,780
if you don't want to hear from us about

183
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,580
marketing here's what you do and leave

184
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,840
it kind of nice and simple for people

185
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,460
but it's definitely a balance of trying

186
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,560
to just emphasize I think and somehow

187
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,240
highlight the things that are most

188
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,740
important to users in your policy in a

189
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,220
way that makes sense right now meiju

190
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,759
um

191
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,860
privacy policies aren't just important

192
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,800
for informing users about what you do

193
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,960
with their data they're important for

194
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,240
informing the developers about what they

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,300
can and can't do with their products and

196
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,080
import informing ux designers about how

197
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,199
to build ux based on what the privacy

198
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,940
policy says you can talk a little bit

199
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,840
about like how how do you navigate a

200
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,940
privacy policy to know what you can and

201
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,139
can't do

202
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,960
yeah that's a cool question

203
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,060
um according to Pew research only nine

204
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,940
percent of people read privacy policies

205
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,220
or at least glance at it

206
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,080
um I think that might apply to the

207
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
people working at the company as well

208
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,139
um and that's kind of a problem because

209
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,940
engine I mean I do product Engineers

210
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,700
need to know what the policies are as

211
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,640
they're building as we are designing

212
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,440
um I will not say which company it was

213
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,599
but I've been in a room full of very

214
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,360
great engineers and we've had a decision

215
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,160
of like what happens when you uncheck

216
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,279
the consent check box and everybody had

217
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,019
a different answer there are so many

218
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,760
infrastructures and how those decisions

219
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,300
get propagated out is very technical and

220
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,640
very complicated

221
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
so baking in those policies up front

222
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,140
working with privacy at the outset can

223
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,660
help answer well does this consent check

224
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,300
mark apply to just the data now or all

225
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,160
the data going forward what about the

226
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,160
data going behind it's very complicated

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,500
and that's why we have to bring the

228
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,600
privacy policy in front of the user like

229
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,300
at that moment where it's relevant you

230
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,339
need to tell the user what exactly

231
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,019
happens with their data and that's a

232
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,180
very hard thing to convey because it's

233
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,399
complicated but I think we have to think

234
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,700
about privacy policies context actually

235
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,580
yeah and Gabriella I want to go back to

236
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,019
you because we want to talk about the

237
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,060
future what does the future look like

238
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,100
for the legislative Outlook in terms of

239
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,660
like tracking and sale of data and Ai

240
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,560
and are we getting more prescriptive in

241
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,940
terms of what you have to pack into a

242
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,600
privacy policy well we are getting

243
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,320
um

244
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,220
I would say equally prescriptive but I

245
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,500
am and I think we're getting to a point

246
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,200
where it's going to be

247
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,980
complicated to give this notice about

248
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,300
selling personal information sharing

249
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
personal information as long as we don't

250
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,580
all agree about what that actually means

251
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,720
but at the same time I was just looking

252
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,080
recently over the bill proposed in India

253
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,600
for example the personal data protection

254
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,740
bill in India where the transparency

255
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,700
obligation seems to just be limited at a

256
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,700
notice at collection that provides

257
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,500
information about the categories of

258
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,600
personal information that will be

259
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,519
collected and the purposes for which

260
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,839
they will be collected so I think that

261
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,079
lawmakers are also grappling with the

262
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,060
complexity and the length of privacy

263
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,320
policies and are thinking of ways to

264
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,940
make this transparency meaningful

265
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,880
so I would not be surprised if in the

266
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,060
next generation of reviewing data

267
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,940
protection laws and privacy laws around

268
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,959
the world will see a bit more

269
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,260
um in the direction of being clearer

270
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,880
shorter but meaningful towards

271
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,560
transparency I think there is also

272
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,019
another point that I wanted to make in

273
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,200
this sense even the gdpr with its length

274
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,519
and with its complexity

275
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,100
envisioned that ultimately ideally we

276
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,740
would have icons and images that would

277
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,800
convey towards

278
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,240
individuals what's happening with their

279
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,720
data until now we haven't seen a lot of

280
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,040
that but the text is there in the gdpr

281
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,940
and hopefully we will see some I don't

282
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,880
know certifications around icons or or

283
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,820
something like that so I I hold hope

284
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,620
that we won't have in the future longer

285
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,820
and longer and longer policies that end

286
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,880
up being meaningless to the user yeah

287
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,519
yeah that's a good point to come back to

288
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,740
in just a minute as we talk about what

289
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,680
we can do in the future to to build from

290
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,420
there

291
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,320
one of the things I want to talk about

292
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,660
next though before we get into like the

293
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,360
path to the Future are the things that

294
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,500
we want to consider as we as we move to

295
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,779
that state as we talk about like

296
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,540
tackling challenges in presenting

297
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,399
Privacy Information to the user I'm

298
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,779
going to throw these questions out to

299
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:44,600
all of you grab whatever speak up what

300
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,100
how do we

301
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,959
um we've got so many jurisdictional

302
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,700
requirements

303
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,720
um

304
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,839
how do we

305
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,459
tackle

306
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,100
the risk-based approach like are we

307
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,040
getting to a point where you can't just

308
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,240
have a one-size-fits-all privacy policy

309
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,920
yeah maybe I'll stop with just some of

310
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,959
um you know I work with companies that

311
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:13,940
are

312
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,260
making their products and services

313
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,220
available globally and so I I often get

314
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,300
asked to help create a kind of global

315
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,300
privacy policy that that is the kind of

316
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,540
Holy Grail of

317
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,360
privacy policy and I think it really

318
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,880
um I I mean I leave the the rest of the

319
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,500
panel talk about some of the U.S

320
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,360
requirements but you know when when

321
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,300
you're thinking about how to even go

322
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,639
about doing something like that it's

323
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,760
really important to have a very really

324
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,540
have a very detailed conversation

325
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,160
amongst the business about you know

326
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,800
where are most of our users going to be

327
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,200
you've got to map that against where are

328
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,660
the high-risk jurisdictions what what is

329
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,519
our risk profile look like how high

330
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,279
profile are we you know if you're

331
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,779
um you know if you're meta that's

332
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,519
different so if you know you might be

333
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,800
kind of less high profile

334
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,779
um you know how do you feel about your

335
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,540
reputation how do you feel about how you

336
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,760
want your users to engage and and

337
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,740
there's a big piece of this is around

338
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,680
trust and around trans how that links to

339
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,839
transparency so

340
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,220
um and there's lots of cultural

341
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,380
differences as well so you know in

342
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,459
particular

343
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,800
um even even across a fairly small

344
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,200
geographic area like

345
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,019
um Europe you know there's how people in

346
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,700
in Germany might feel comfortable about

347
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,199
how you're using their data and how that

348
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,180
information is presented could be

349
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,959
different

350
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,620
um to the UK or France or Italy so and

351
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,800
you've got language issues too so um you

352
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,740
need to navigate so it's it's a com it's

353
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,540
a it's a really important conversation

354
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,060
to have to find

355
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,699
um a solution that works for everyone

356
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,160
um and is you know acceptable from a

357
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,779
kind of risk perspective and that and

358
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,279
that really could change that's the

359
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,440
other thing it's not a kind of one and

360
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
we're done it's it's an evolving

361
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,060
situation you point you you hit on

362
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,800
something that is near and dear to my

363
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,779
heart that is that privacy is cultural

364
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,620
and that what one cultural one cultural

365
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,519
what one culture

366
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,260
expects in terms of how their data will

367
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,660
be used is vastly different from what

368
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,360
another expects and how they expect to

369
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,180
be communicated with about privacy is

370
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,920
vastly different

371
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,680
um Gabriella I'm kind of looking to you

372
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,920
because this is your your sweet spot how

373
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,680
do you communicate with users around the

374
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,139
world

375
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,260
again do we find that that one Holy

376
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,980
Grail privacy policy or do we create

377
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,160
multiple interactions around privacy I

378
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,199
mean I wish we would find that Holy

379
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:01,079
Grail and I will hold this as you know

380
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,019
my Guiding Light throughout my career

381
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,420
but I think it it's it's very very

382
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,639
difficult to do that so

383
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,940
um you're absolutely right in in saying

384
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,480
that the cultural differences matter as

385
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,639
well not only the legal requirements

386
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,560
there are different types of

387
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,019
expectations of privacy in different

388
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,660
cultures and I can give you as an

389
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,420
example my own case when I moved from

390
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,880
the EU to the United States about six

391
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,360
years ago and I realized that here it's

392
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,880
so common to have your home address just

393
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,740
you know publicly available and all

394
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,300
sorts of information that's just public

395
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,459
available and nobody questions it or

396
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:45,060
almost nobody to me that felt like a

397
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,079
shock I was wondering what is going on

398
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:54,899
um so that's just to to show that indeed

399
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,420
um the the expectations the cultural

400
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,940
expectations are different and they

401
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,360
matter a lot and when you're designing a

402
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,819
privacy policy that's supposed to serve

403
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,459
for operations around the world it's

404
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,260
it's very very

405
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,119
um complicated I would say to do this

406
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,459
but it matters a lot because ultimately

407
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,000
transparency is about what is perceived

408
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,720
at the other end of your notice and your

409
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,819
policy so

410
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,579
um that's what's really essential here

411
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,780
uh what do that does that user what does

412
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,160
that data subject individual understand

413
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,260
from how you explain

414
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,940
um what's happening with their

415
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,900
information so uh

416
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,000
Holy Grail ultimately but in the

417
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,919
meantime we'll have to Grapple with

418
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,260
these differences and and

419
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,559
um well yeah we'll have to to deal with

420
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,900
these differences yeah yeah if I can

421
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,299
yeah absolutely I was turning to you

422
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,640
next yeah okay

423
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,919
um I think not only is it different

424
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,240
culturally but it's it's changing

425
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
um one thing that we saw is that people

426
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,980
from the trans Community came to Google

427
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,320
ads and said hey you know what

428
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,600
um we think that actually targeted ads

429
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,419
are gender affirming we feel seen this

430
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,960
is something we want on the platform

431
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
and that's something that's really

432
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,260
changed over time and I don't think it's

433
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,120
the whole community and obviously this

434
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,740
is not like number one on the agenda

435
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,299
list but

436
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,160
um I think this is the cool thing about

437
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,740
building products is that you can give

438
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,440
users choices and you can give users

439
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,200
control and you can default to out or in

440
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,020
based on the sensitive that you perceive

441
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,620
and how it changes over time

442
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,840
precise location data is something that

443
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,539
has changed over time I think I would

444
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,100
argue that I mean maybe not for everyone

445
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,020
but for me that's always been very

446
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,539
sensitive but it's really increased in

447
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,520
our awareness and so now we're seeing

448
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,640
some some legislation that says like hey

449
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,260
you need to be careful with how you

450
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,120
treat the sensitive data which to me is

451
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,460
very reasonable because it's in line

452
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,520
with user preferences so over time we're

453
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,840
going to continue to see these

454
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,100
differences and I think these

455
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,780
differences in sensitivity are only

456
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,700
getting bigger and not smaller and

457
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,980
that's really the importance of giving

458
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,140
users options and letting them have

459
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,440
control

460
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,500
changes

461
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,700
in context

462
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,080
I mean

463
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,360
your your

464
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,679
location data

465
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,580
might be useful in one context we saw a

466
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,059
presentation on this on the other day

467
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,280
might be useful in the context of okay

468
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,179
I'm using maps and not useful in the

469
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,720
context of I'm using a flashlight

470
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,580
um

471
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,200
how do you

472
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,140
um get more granular with the context

473
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,000
and with how it changes over time

474
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,100
I we I mean a conversation that we often

475
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,780
have whenever we're looking at a new way

476
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,820
to use data or new data we may want to

477
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,080
collect

478
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,720
um is I think an internal discussion and

479
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,980
then also sometimes an external

480
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,500
discussion and so internally it's it's

481
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,480
really the question this question we go

482
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,100
through with our we talk through

483
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,539
something with our engineering teams and

484
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,059
if you're if you're a user what would

485
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,640
you worry about in this situation and

486
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,020
just having that that sort of thought

487
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,580
process to Think Through what are the

488
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,620
different ways this might be used or

489
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,000
what would I be worried about what would

490
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,020
I want to make sure that you're not

491
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,340
doing

492
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,620
um so we can use that as something like

493
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,660
a common sense user-focused approach to

494
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,880
it so that's that's one thing

495
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,539
um

496
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,360
and then you know over time you hear

497
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
from your users I mean I love the when

498
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,720
you were mentioning this about just the

499
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,460
the conversation with users who come to

500
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,320
you with feedback whenever we do a large

501
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,600
privacy policy update we put on our blog

502
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,700
we get users that comment and tell us

503
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,020
things that they think are they have

504
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,400
questions about or a little confused

505
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,539
about

506
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,940
um and it's led us to sharpen our focus

507
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,620
on okay we need to do a better job of

508
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,940
explaining this to people because they

509
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,980
this this this one particular sentence

510
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,480
caused people a bit of confusion so

511
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,740
let's fix it

512
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,240
um so that conversation that feedback

513
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,620
loop with your users I think is really

514
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,240
important to be able to calibrate in the

515
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,280
right way and keep keep up with what's

516
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,500
changing for them yeah so Holly I want

517
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,299
to follow up with you especially on that

518
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,260
yeah

519
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,380
um when you're looking at a different

520
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,100
use and you have to obtain consent

521
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,419
should that consent be contextual

522
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,000
I I I tend to think so because I think I

523
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,799
think when we're learning more and more

524
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,980
you know today is just that our data can

525
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,419
be used in so many different ways a lot

526
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:43,980
of great ways right I mean there's a lot

527
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,179
of great things that can be done with it

528
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,640
and there's also a lot of things that

529
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,720
could be used in ways you're not

530
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,460
expecting and I think especially when

531
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,659
you look at the types of things that

532
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,520
need consent that legally need consent

533
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,440
you're really talking about things where

534
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,840
someone has to say that's okay with me

535
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,179
before you do it it's not an opt out

536
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:02,460
it's like it's okay with me

537
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,100
um it's an affirmative yes and in those

538
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,360
situations you should be talking about

539
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,940
pretty sensitive data data and so it's

540
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,020
the things that people are going to be

541
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,460
the most concerned about and if we're

542
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,140
going to talk about all the things users

543
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,240
have options on that would be one where

544
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,659
it in my opinion focusing on that makes

545
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:19,980
the most sense to give people that kind

546
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,679
of more granular choice

547
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,799
and then the fun stuff

548
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:30,299
um let's talk about Ai and ml like how

549
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,679
um

550
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,140
how does a company because we're going

551
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,760
to talk about this more

552
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,740
in just a second how does a company

553
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,780
disclose its use of AI and ml

554
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,220
um Emily I know you were talking about

555
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,460
some some approaches to that yeah so I

556
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,620
you know this is again one of one of the

557
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,080
challenges that we have is that when it

558
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,020
comes to more complex and unexpected use

559
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,620
cases which includes the use of AI

560
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,659
especially where it has a kind of

561
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,700
significant impact on someone then

562
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,580
there's a greater burden on companies to

563
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,580
explain that and there's I if you

564
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,640
haven't read it there's some really

565
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,799
excellent guidance I think by the UK

566
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,620
information commissioner's office around

567
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,419
particularly around explainability and

568
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,780
what they think is uh you know some good

569
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,179
practice and and some good ideas around

570
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,539
you know how how do we explain something

571
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,700
that you know it's it's complicated it's

572
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,620
complicated for engineers to explain

573
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,280
it's not always clear how certain

574
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,860
outcomes are achieved

575
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,020
and and it's something that people

576
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,940
wouldn't necessarily expect so I do

577
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,520
think that's really good and and we've

578
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,620
been working with the company on an

579
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,020
explainability statement and which

580
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,260
delves into a lot of this kind of detail

581
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,940
which you can find

582
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,980
um so I did command that website but

583
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,980
again it's it's about having that

584
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,860
conversation about what how we're using

585
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,340
AI what what are we thinking of now and

586
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,980
what are we thinking about using and

587
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,960
doing in the future and that that is a

588
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,880
real Challenge and back to the kind of

589
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,120
piece around user feedback you know what

590
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,820
what in our minds might be really cool

591
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,280
and exciting might actually in other

592
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,799
people's views be actually a bit creepy

593
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,159
and unexpected and odd so we have to

594
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,720
keep that in mind there was a recent

595
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,179
Scandal where a mental health company

596
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:38,419
was using in chat GPT to prompt

597
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:43,520
responses to users who were in crisis

598
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,059
and that I think really needs an

599
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,700
explainability statement a disclosure an

600
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,340
end time

601
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,659
you know

602
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,400
we're we're pushing the boundaries of

603
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,460
use of technology in ways that really

604
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,640
need transparency like in time in

605
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,340
context yeah and in that example it's

606
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,280
not just around the sensitivity of data

607
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,860
it's the context in which that person is

608
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,559
receiving and engaging with the website

609
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,320
that that needs to be transparent I

610
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,100
think

611
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,960
Gabriella you looked like you were yeah

612
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,659
I wanted to to add something uh to this

613
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,039
excellent point

614
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,700
um so this type of transparency uh will

615
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,700
become indeed more and more relevant

616
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,120
um and particularly from the European

617
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,400
point of view it comes from a

618
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,760
requirement actually in the gdpr to be

619
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,640
transparent about the logic involved in

620
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,279
a particular type of automated decision

621
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,620
making solely automated decision making

622
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,919
that has a significant impact on the

623
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,900
individual and now I think we will see

624
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,400
um more and more activity about

625
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,640
understanding what does the logic

626
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,440
involved mean

627
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,220
um how detailed should we explain this

628
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,140
logic and I think this is something that

629
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,200
we will certainly be seeing more of

630
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
um the types of policies that you were

631
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,700
talking about earlier that you were

632
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,919
working on

633
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,640
and just just very important to keep an

634
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,220
eye on the logic involved in this type

635
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,919
of decision making yeah yeah yeah

636
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,720
so let's talk about the future

637
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,600
how we've we've talked about why things

638
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,700
are bad we've talked about the things

639
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,400
that we have to consider when we're

640
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,419
looking at moving forward

641
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:47,279
what do what does the future look like

642
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,159
what are some novel approaches to

643
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,000
building privacy policies or even better

644
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,240
building privacy Communications with

645
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,659
individuals Holly when we were talking

646
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,600
about this earlier it was either you or

647
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,000
Emily I can't remember

648
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,580
proposed uh

649
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,159
in in privacy policies right now we kind

650
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,419
of start with uh the the most boring

651
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,779
stuff we start with you know we collect

652
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,779
your account information and your email

653
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,820
address and like everybody knows that

654
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,220
because we just gave it to you yeah talk

655
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,320
to me about how you can do it yeah I

656
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,320
have um this is a position we've we've

657
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,240
taken we've been talking to policy

658
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,919
makers and in DC and especially about

659
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,799
this is around the idea of you know I

660
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,360
think especially at this point you know

661
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,400
we're much more digitally savvy than we

662
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
were you know in 1997 when I you know

663
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,720
first when I first got my first email

664
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,799
address

665
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,279
um and and so you I think users and

666
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,080
especially a generationally just have a

667
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,460
much better understanding of things so

668
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,200
maybe we can do instead of focusing on

669
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,640
everything maybe everything needs to be

670
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,460
in there still but can we highlight some

671
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,080
things that look if you're going to do

672
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,299
certain things you have to say them you

673
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,620
have to say it right at the top so you

674
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,840
got to talk about do you sell data are

675
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,340
you a data broker that should go up top

676
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,500
precise location data like music was

677
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,640
mentioning that should be up top if

678
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,840
you're using it

679
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,520
um how you respond I would say also how

680
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,840
you respond to law enforcement and

681
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,860
government demands for information

682
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,500
should be right at the top

683
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,539
um and and anything else that is going

684
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,039
to be especially sensitive I think if we

685
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,240
all sat down here we could probably

686
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,520
agree on you know five to ten things

687
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,960
that we all would see is really

688
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,000
sensitive and really important and those

689
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,679
should just be up at the top and you can

690
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,419
talk about in more detail later but at

691
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,580
least giving people that sort of flash

692
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,340
time information instead of instead of

693
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,840
right now I think it's burying the lead

694
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,760
the lead is you know that information is

695
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,100
often on page 13's paragraph two

696
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,900
sentence four

697
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,700
um and not not where someone's going to

698
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,419
find it yeah yeah that's it

699
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,820
does anyone else want to chime in on

700
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,860
that oh I yeah I mean I think there's

701
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,320
other ways that we can deliver that

702
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,360
information as well in terms of the

703
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,799
content's critical and I think

704
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,260
reordering things prioritizing is good

705
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,720
but even you know there's been some

706
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,120
studies done and if people see a kind of

707
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,200
FAQ or q a type style document that

708
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,900
really enhances their understanding or

709
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,720
if you say hey we've got a privacy note

710
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,220
to say it'll take you about five minutes

711
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,380
to have a quick look through you know

712
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,120
that would encourage people rather than

713
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,779
be hit with you know a huge policy that

714
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,460
looks like it might take a couple of

715
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,840
hours

716
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,700
um you know and then having that ability

717
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,360
to go back and look at again and have it

718
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,360
very easy to navigate policy where you

719
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,100
can get right to the bit of information

720
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,919
that you need through uh you know

721
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,620
privacy and then in privacy settings or

722
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,799
in a kind of self-service type kind of

723
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,020
element of the site you know all of

724
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,240
those I think it's there's lots of

725
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,039
little and different things that we can

726
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,039
be thinking about that could help

727
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,600
so there's a whole different way to

728
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,100
present Privacy Information and meet you

729
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,919
talk us through this yeah so I came from

730
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,240
Twitter

731
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,919
um I didn't work on this personally but

732
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,659
some people in this room might be musk

733
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,559
Twitter we have to establish that right

734
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:19,500
prior to this year and

735
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,360
I don't know how many of y'all saw the

736
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,140
Twitter data Dash so it's a picture of a

737
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,020
game with a very cute dog who's very

738
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,320
curious to find bones in a city of

739
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,539
privacy policies

740
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:34,260
um

741
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,480
I think here we gotta praise the effort

742
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,559
because talking to people in fun ways is

743
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,299
something we have to think about in

744
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,700
talking to them about privacy

745
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,360
um

746
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,799
for those of you who actually played the

747
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,179
game I don't know if you're like me and

748
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,559
you like had trouble making it through

749
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,179
the first level because I totally did

750
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,760
I'm not great with the arrow keys but um

751
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,000
so it's not for everyone but

752
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,059
making it fun making it interactive I

753
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,760
think it's a good attempt and we need to

754
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,679
praise this even if it didn't like reach

755
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,799
everybody

756
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,240
absolutely I think there is a lot of

757
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,700
room to to gamify some some of this

758
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,899
information

759
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,760
um and going back to the icons I

760
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,020
mentioned earlier

761
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,480
um and and the possibility of presenting

762
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,520
concise information you know let's say a

763
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,080
first layer

764
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,299
um with the images

765
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,059
um icons maybe a short video I don't

766
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,120
know a 30 seconds fun video saying

767
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,679
something about

768
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,460
um

769
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,500
um and again honestly this is very

770
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,140
important about how the personal

771
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,240
information is used there is absolutely

772
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,520
a lot of room for that and I hope we'll

773
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,179
see a bit more in this direction uh in

774
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,679
the future

775
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,220
I want to talk about who's done

776
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,940
um privacy Communications well

777
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,380
oh

778
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,700
nope

779
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,620
well we'll show this

780
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,419
um well I guess

781
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,059
um one part of doing privacy

782
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,340
communication well I think is in giving

783
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,520
the user meaningful control

784
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,200
but there are a lot of settings Pages

785
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,200
for privacy that are super long they

786
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
have a ton of options they're very

787
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,659
confusing to the user so I think we

788
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,220
don't want to just think is this too

789
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,799
confusing for the user but also does

790
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,960
this actually help the user Make

791
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,000
meaningful decisions about their privacy

792
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,480
like that's the standard

793
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,220
and so if you go to the previous slide

794
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,820
this is a bad ad that I saw I don't know

795
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,260
if Eric's in the room but like hey check

796
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,159
it out it's a bad ad for me it's an ad

797
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,039
that shows how to reduce tummy fat by

798
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,140
age and you know for me I don't really

799
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,760
want this anytime but like I'm five

800
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,860
months pregnant this is ridiculous for

801
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,120
me

802
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,640
um I hate it uh so kind of some

803
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,159
self-promotion now this is a UI of a

804
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,620
very clean interface with only five

805
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,659
choices for sensitive categories and I

806
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:03,059
can just turn off like no don't quit

807
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,820
showing me weight loss ads I think this

808
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,559
is the level of Simplicity we want to

809
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,940
get to

810
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,720
um

811
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,700
you know to help users advertise like

812
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,559
privacy settings really needs to be

813
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,899
thought of as a first-class consumer

814
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:19,140
product it's not an afterthought

815
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,799
and and so

816
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,299
and supple interface this is a image of

817
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:31,919
the iPhone showing asking the user to

818
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,399
whether or not to allow Maps

819
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,779
while you're using it

820
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:40,980
and then notifying the user that

821
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,059
a particular app has used their location

822
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:45,779
um

823
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,059
two times in the background of the last

824
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,460
three days

825
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,820
so showing the user how their data has

826
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,820
been used is being used in time and in

827
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,240
context and then allowing them the

828
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,019
ability to make choices around it is a

829
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,720
good way of presenting personal

830
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,839
information and presenting choice

831
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,599
yeah if I can go on because when I see a

832
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,300
UI I just get excited

833
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,540
but uh you know this apple UI dark sky

834
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,280
has been using your location dark sky

835
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,540
rip

836
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,800
um has used your location in the

837
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,260
background two times and then I think as

838
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,418
a user like wait do I really need my

839
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:29,339
weather app to do background location

840
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,320
like is it that important that the

841
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,699
weather's there when I'm like probably

842
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,679
not for me because we talked about

843
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,440
precise location data being sensitive to

844
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,899
me and to many people

845
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:40,500
um

846
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,960
the really cool thing about this is that

847
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,719
it proactively prompts you you make a

848
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,060
privacy decision on like the previous UI

849
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,820
and then maybe you don't understand the

850
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,040
ramifications of it so proactively

851
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,399
prompting I think is a really great way

852
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,320
to think about this

853
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,900
um this is the kind of UI where you say

854
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,880
like holy cow why is my laundry app

855
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,400
using my location in the background you

856
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,480
know

857
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,480
um so I think this is awesome

858
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,680
so I want to um to touch on another

859
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,859
novel approach to privacy policies

860
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:18,839
chat GPT

861
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:21,839
should we be allowing chat GPT to write

862
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,820
privacy policies for us and then all of

863
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,980
us just you know heading off head on off

864
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,460
to Maui

865
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,560
join us

866
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,900
yeah so Hannah's question actually

867
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,220
prompted me because I've been thinking a

868
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,520
lot about our our policy and um and and

869
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,440
how we can make it better and improve it

870
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,900
and so this year it's money to spend

871
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,280
some time on just simplifying it even

872
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,900
further what can we cut out we spent a

873
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,339
lot of time getting these new laws and

874
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:48,839
putting stuff in

875
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,760
um and so I kind of went down a rabbit

876
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,980
hole the other night ago of putting some

877
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,020
paragraphs from our privacy policy into

878
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,780
chat GPT and seeing what would happen

879
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,220
um are they still in the slide I think

880
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,079
they might be on the next there you go

881
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,339
yeah so I um I I first I I basically

882
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,540
said can you take this paragraph and

883
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,240
make it more uh you know write it more

884
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,740
simply and more understandable and I

885
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,260
said please because I'm trying to be

886
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,980
um

887
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,200
with devices I mean I know obviously not

888
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,940
people but I think it's just polite to

889
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,619
convin you know not good into being a

890
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,720
demanding person all the time because it

891
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,400
leads over into other areas of your life

892
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,599
you know if you're like turn on the

893
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,940
light you know into your your spouse or

894
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,560
something so

895
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,140
um so and this is a it's a this is a

896
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,579
pretty common I think many people have

897
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,560
this that this is how we use your data

898
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,599
so we can Market our services

899
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,160
um you know we use our data to Mark our

900
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,900
services and measure engage and improve

901
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,160
the effectiveness of our marketing and

902
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,660
we give some examples about what we do

903
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,640
and so then I started doing well what if

904
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,900
you did this in

905
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,300
the style of Hemingway because he's a

906
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,859
great writer and it's sort of forceful

907
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,180
and actionable and I might be on the

908
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,500
next slide I think

909
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,900
um just to put that through so

910
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,240
um it sort of went through what we could

911
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,339
do and he was like to sell our Wares we

912
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,320
measure engage their worth

913
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,240
um and we analyze the impact of

914
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,980
campaigns targeting specific groups of

915
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,740
our our clientele

916
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,900
um sort of move through that I mean at

917
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,280
any and it gets a little in character

918
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,079
it's a game of numbers and a battle for

919
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,420
survival

920
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,099
and like the bone an old man on the sea

921
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,359
right

922
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,060
um and we strive to always improve but

923
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,800
there's actually some useful things some

924
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,320
useful Clips in there and I also did

925
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,839
um you can I did Don Quixote

926
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,400
um who was like the noble art of

927
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,720
marketing

928
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,060
um Tony Morrison was talk about purpose

929
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,680
and intention which I thought was was

930
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,880
useful

931
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,280
um uh Tom Wolf bonfire the vanities was

932
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,160
like we are we we mark it with Panache

933
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,079
and flare and Elan I was like I don't

934
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,760
even know Elan was a word I think I kind

935
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,839
of wanted to figure out a way to use it

936
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,020
privacy policy now so it's useful and

937
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,520
then I asked it can you do it simpler

938
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,220
can you make it more conversational and

939
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,079
and so you ended up here is that

940
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,780
actually I still think I would work with

941
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,180
this right it's I think you lose some of

942
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,859
the as a lawyer look at this and go it

943
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,180
takes all the examples and makes them

944
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,200
finite

945
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,460
um which you know is a little bit

946
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,960
limiting and there's certainly the

947
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,520
scented structure if you're talking

948
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,280
about AIS as a little more repetitive

949
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,500
versus the way a good human a good human

950
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,880
writer writes

951
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,200
um but I think there's I think it gives

952
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,940
you some copy editing to work from and

953
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,500
then and it can help and I would

954
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,839
probably take some things from this

955
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,240
um and um and it was wildly entertaining

956
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,640
on our slack channel for our legal Team

957
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,900
every 15 minutes and people started

958
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,060
putting in like you know

959
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,220
um uh Little Women you know the style of

960
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,839
Louisiana Alcott and all that was great

961
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,700
but I think I think it can be useful I

962
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,020
don't think it's a sole replacement but

963
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,640
like for many things I think it can be a

964
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
really useful way to get a different

965
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,420
perspective get outside your own sort of

966
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,540
writing um style and see see what the

967
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,579
the every the whole west of the world

968
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,500
that got you know put into this comes up

969
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,240
with yeah and like Holly and I were

970
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,280
talking at breakfast about how we don't

971
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,780
really know how to write at a Middle

972
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,000
School reading level that's not

973
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,680
something I mean maybe when somebody

974
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,839
here can do it but like I can't and so

975
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,640
it can

976
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,520
yeah so uh if I get I mean I think this

977
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,680
is a lot of fun and I think you know as

978
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,000
long as we ask Chad GPT to rewrite in a

979
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,119
different style the information that we

980
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,140
give it uh it's fun and it works and

981
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,780
maybe it can work for different

982
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,040
audiences but this other idea that Omer

983
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,820
uh tried here asking cha GPD to actually

984
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,980
write the policy for a particular

985
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,280
business scenario I think that's the

986
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,740
complete opposite of what transparency

987
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,820
means uh in in privacy because what it

988
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,680
means is that it has to mirror and

989
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,560
explain what is actually happening with

990
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,359
some real processes

991
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,940
inside a business inside a company

992
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,180
inside an organization a school whatever

993
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,940
um if we just come up with like a

994
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,440
blanket type of response that is the

995
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,440
antithesis of what transparency means so

996
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,200
from this point of view no from that

997
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,440
point of view oh yes I mean it's super

998
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,000
fun and I think you know depending on

999
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,900
your audience you can ask a rewrite for

1000
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,740
a accurate description of the processes

1001
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,260
yeah I I think we've we've been chatting

1002
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,839
about this um amongst my colleagues and

1003
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,119
I I've totally agree you know that the

1004
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,280
drawbacks are you know you the whole

1005
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,560
purpose of the privacy policy is it

1006
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,240
really has to be

1007
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,460
um you know effective way of

1008
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,500
communicating what you as a company are

1009
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,320
doing and you know Regulators that are

1010
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,900
increasingly looking at this stuff you

1011
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,760
know if you come up with some kind of

1012
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,619
very Bland vague uh kind of policy

1013
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,240
they're not going to be very impressed

1014
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,700
and neither of your you know users gonna

1015
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,880
be really given much information to make

1016
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,220
meaningful decisions about whether they

1017
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,260
want to use services or consent to

1018
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,140
something so I I think it definitely has

1019
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,660
a place I think it's similar to

1020
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,099
um you know how you might just go online

1021
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,560
and just you know copy something offline

1022
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,900
the challenge you have is you don't know

1023
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,599
when it was created which laws it

1024
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,640
complies with we have laws with very

1025
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,480
specific terminologies and I think

1026
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,859
um you know and this goes for other

1027
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,839
legal documents

1028
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,300
um you know the specific use of a a

1029
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,000
phrase or a word has a very very

1030
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,339
specific meaning that has been built up

1031
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,140
through case law over many years so that

1032
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,420
I think as I think it's fine I think it

1033
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,520
has a place I I think we'll probably

1034
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,980
we'll still be drafting policies but

1035
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,560
yeah we might have bit more fun doing it

1036
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,599
which is really good

1037
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,820
so Emily when we were talking

1038
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,140
um you said something that I thought was

1039
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:56,400
wonderful that we should use is this too

1040
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,220
confusing for the user as a guiding

1041
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,200
principle when writing privacy policies

1042
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,500
can you expound on that yeah I I think

1043
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,220
it's really about

1044
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,920
understanding what who your audience is

1045
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,640
and what they are what information you

1046
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,320
need to convey and how they're going to

1047
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,420
understand what

1048
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,880
um what what it is you're saying and

1049
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,579
this is becoming a really increasingly

1050
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,760
important issue in the context of

1051
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,640
particularly the use of

1052
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,099
um children's data where you know we

1053
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:34,680
could have a whole day about this but um

1054
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,380
that that is really challenging because

1055
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,720
or other you know vulnerable groups

1056
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,579
because you have to be really careful

1057
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:45,780
about the the style the content the the

1058
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,060
just the way you're presenting and you

1059
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,980
know we as lawyers might write something

1060
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,800
in you know in a particular way but it

1061
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,960
is it written to really be

1062
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,060
understandable and I I think that's an

1063
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,339
incredibly important issue and it's

1064
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,680
gonna it's gonna be more more important

1065
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,940
going forward

1066
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,300
I agree so my last question before we

1067
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,440
move to q a Gabriella I'm looking at you

1068
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,660
we talked a minute about ago about like

1069
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,140
the the Holy Grail of privacy notices do

1070
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,420
you think it would be better for us to

1071
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,940
have to move more to

1072
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,599
granular privacy notices

1073
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,500
um that convey less information but more

1074
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,060
specific information to users

1075
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:36,599
I think what everybody should be moving

1076
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,819
forward to is Meaningful transparency

1077
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:41,280
and meaningful notices meaningful

1078
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,099
information towards

1079
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:46,680
individuals and users this might mean

1080
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,359
being granular and not uh you know using

1081
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,180
a broad brush to describe things and

1082
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,720
thus perhaps deceiving the user so it it

1083
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,420
might go into that direction

1084
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,660
um I think we might see more and more

1085
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,700
layered approaches and I think this is

1086
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,980
something that Regulators have been

1087
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,040
pushing for particularly in Europe

1088
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,500
and

1089
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,380
and yes I'm all for Meaningful you know

1090
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,500
policies even if that means being

1091
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,280
granular ultimately

1092
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,859
I really appreciate all all four of you

1093
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,960
how about a round of applause for our

1094
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,620
panelists

1095
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,620
[Applause]
