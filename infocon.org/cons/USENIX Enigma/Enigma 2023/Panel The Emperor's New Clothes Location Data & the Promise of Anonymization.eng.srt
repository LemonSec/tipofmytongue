1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,880
it's uh it's an exciting thing to be the

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,560
first panel of the day for what's a

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,080
wonderful con uh conference that I

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,880
believe is very multi-disciplinary and

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,619
really engages in really thoughtful

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,039
discussions about the positives and the

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
negatives and the risks and the benefits

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,780
of things that go on here and so

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,340
um we want to start today by talking

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,280
about location data which is a very very

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,700
Hot Topic in uh both the technical and

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,000
Regulatory landscape today I have a

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,940
wonderful panel with me I'm Aaron Alva

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,579
I'm a technologist at the Federal Trade

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,340
Commission and I'm moderating today and

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,520
then briefly if you can say your name

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,780
and

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,120
area of expertise

20
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,579
hi I am Barrel Lipton I am an

21
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,899
investigative researcher with the

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,420
Electronic Frontier Foundation where I

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,760
focus a lot on police surveillance and

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,560
government transparency

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,740
good morning I'm Dr Jennifer King I am

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,960
at the Stanford Institute for

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,000
human-centered artificial intelligence

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,979
I'm the privacy and data policy fellow

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,320
and my work kind of sits at the

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,360
intersection of HCI and consumer privacy

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,700
I'm Brandi Bennett I am a private

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,500
practice attorney I've been in-house at

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,299
a number of companies for 15 years

34
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,939
including in the data privacy space for

35
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,240
almost 10 years now working with

36
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,520
everything from geolocation data to

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,340
biometric data to U.S law to

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,439
international law so I got all the

39
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,939
hands-on experience with all these crazy

40
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,880
companies out there yeah so uh so I

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,799
think as you splice out our discussion

42
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,060
today

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,220
um Barrel has a kind of a government

44
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,399
viewpoint on location data uses and

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,259
practices

46
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,960
um Jen has a kind of consumer Viewpoint

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,780
and vantage point from her research uh

48
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,440
and Barrel and uh Brandi has a

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,959
commercial use commercial collection

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,599
kind of perspective to kind of tease out

51
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
so I want to start by Framing the issue

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,500
when we talk about location data let's

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,500
go with definitions to start so we're

54
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,239
going to be talking about precise

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,020
location data so that generally means uh

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,020
whatever precise uh information you get

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,319
from GPS it can also mean information

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,140
that you get from triangulating Wi-Fi

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,080
signals through collecting BSS IDs from

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,319
Wi-Fi access points it's it's what gives

61
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,959
you the Precision of knowing where an

62
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,760
individual or device is at a particular

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
location so so that is what we're

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,140
talking about today we can kind of

65
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,239
splice on the edges when we talk about

66
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,660
what is precise what is course there's a

67
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,940
lot of definitions from industry and

68
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,280
elsewhere that kind of try to get at the

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,560
edges but from a conceptual point of

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,060
view we're talking about precise

71
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,700
location data and I want to start by

72
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,379
like setting the scene of what location

73
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,560
data is now before we talk about the

74
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,060
anonymization

75
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,540
point of view and the risks so uh can we

76
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,060
can we walk through uh what is it look

77
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,640
like today to collect and use location

78
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
data

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,060
um Jen can you talk about collection of

80
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,860
location data today sure I mean I'll

81
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,300
talk about it from the consumer

82
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,280
perspective so I am pretty sure

83
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,440
everybody in here has a smartphone and

84
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,180
probably has had a smartphone for a very

85
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,220
long time

86
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,900
I actually really started looking at

87
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,959
this issue back in 2018 because I was

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,379
staring at my iPhone and I used actually

89
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,360
my first smartphone was an Android phone

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,640
and for those of you who had an Android

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,260
phone back in the day you probably

92
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,819
remembered that there used to be a

93
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,040
location switch kind of upfront Center

94
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,840
in the UI and you could toggle location

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,060
on and off because I'm a privacy

96
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,819
researcher I always have location off

97
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,580
um it makes things hard but I do it and

98
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,739
uh so I was staring at my iPhone and

99
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,080
really trying to work through why does

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,299
the iPhone not have that capacity I have

101
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,580
a Bluetooth switch I have a I have a

102
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,380
Wi-Fi switch but there's no top level

103
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,478
toggle for location data so I tried I

104
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,639
started digging into that issue

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,320
um and that's when you know I realized

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,860
that to some extent the the idea of a

107
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,500
location toggle on off is a bit of a um

108
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
it can be misleading because location is

109
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,639
collected through so many facets in your

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,340
phone it's not just GPS I mean obviously

111
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,520
GPS gives you a great deal of precision

112
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,320
but your location is also picked up

113
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,780
through Bluetooth you know your phone

114
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,220
company obviously knows where you are

115
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,139
and triangulates where you are

116
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,720
um based on your someone talking to cell

117
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,540
phone towers you know apps also get

118
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,880
location through your IP address you

119
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,040
know assuming you're on a data plan so

120
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,320
while you know the ability to toggle

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,780
your GPS transmitter on and off I think

122
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,800
you know

123
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,780
I was really focused on that as kind of

124
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,580
a level of comfort then I realized well

125
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,620
it's actually far more per se pervasive

126
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,900
than just GPS

127
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,520
um and so actually I wrote an op-ed on

128
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
this topic because I tried to dig into

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,680
it both on Android and um and on iOS and

130
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,360
quickly became very frustrated because I

131
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,860
realized from a consumer's perspective

132
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,160
again even if you are able to turn off

133
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,080
GPS tracking on your phone which on the

134
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,520
iPhone I don't know if anybody else like

135
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,139
me does this routinely but it's about

136
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,259
five screens down so you know routinely

137
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,180
if I bring up a Maps app I have to go in

138
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,880
like and I finally get to the toggle off

139
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,280
and I can go back and use it

140
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,900
um it's you know it's a really annoying

141
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,660
experience but at the same time again

142
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,139
it's from a consumer's perspective it

143
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,580
can be I think it's almost a false sense

144
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,979
of security if we give people a high

145
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,600
level toggle without kind of addressing

146
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,699
the bigger issue of just how pervasive

147
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,039
location can be grabbed from your phone

148
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,080
again not just with GPS but through all

149
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
these other means as well you know just

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,220
to say that kind of by Design the these

151
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,060
phones are extremely leaky in terms of

152
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,860
their capacity to tell you where you are

153
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,360
and track you through kind of every

154
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
facet of your life

155
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,120
um and from my research in

156
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,340
work with consumers I would say largely

157
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,699
most people don't grasp that fact

158
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:22,380
they're not generally aware the extent

159
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,180
to which companies are able to track

160
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,840
them uh you know pervasively over time

161
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,199
through everything they do

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,900
sorry I'm still getting over a cold and

163
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,759
so from that perspective I think

164
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,639
location from the consumer side is a bit

165
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,400
of a black box and again people are kind

166
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,800
of cognizant that when you bringing up a

167
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,380
mapping app or something else that asks

168
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,419
for your location in real time that your

169
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,100
location is being gathered at that point

170
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,380
in time but the kind of systematic

171
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,539
long-term Gathering the location that we

172
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,160
see happening across the industry is

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,240
something that I think is generally

174
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,220
invisible to Consumers

175
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,460
and and then once it is collected Brandi

176
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,840
can you talk about some of the General

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,120
Uses from the commercial point of view

178
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,639
as well as the practices of companies

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,620
that collect data in terms of retention

180
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,440
and sale yeah yeah I just want to also

181
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,819
tease out a little bit more on top of

182
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,259
what Jen's saying you know we used to

183
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,419
look at Beacon technology in places like

184
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,160
shopping malls where every store has a

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,840
beacon on it you know that's another

186
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,080
access point geofencing certain specific

187
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,560
locations like Madison Square Garden or

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,380
other venues those are other areas where

189
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,580
we collect that kind of precise

190
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,860
geolocation data but you see a lot of

191
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,240
different use cases I know you talked

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,740
about mapping apps you know that's a

193
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,720
legitimate use case you know we talk

194
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,180
about weather apps I will never download

195
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,680
a weather app because they will sell

196
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,300
your location data I know because I've

197
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,699
bought it I used to do scary things in

198
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,860
the geolocation space before there were

199
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,259
settings on your Android and on your iOS

200
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,120
phone I used to work at one of these

201
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,060
geolocation companies ad networks and

202
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,560
analytics companies that really just

203
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,740
wanted to collect data and sell it out

204
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,919
to a variety of advertisers you look at

205
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,360
your car these days your car is

206
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,340
collecting geolocation data your car is

207
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,680
a computer and it is always collecting

208
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,960
that information whether it's for the

209
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,300
purpose of tracking you know how your

210
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,280
vehicle works and uses for keeping it

211
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,319
connected for various services on the on

212
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,240
the vehicle but also it's they're

213
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,560
selling that data to your insurance

214
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,800
carrier okay Ford has a deal with a

215
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,860
number of insurance carriers to you know

216
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,780
share that data over to other parties

217
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,458
you know this is a revenue stream for

218
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,958
them

219
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,580
um in terms of how you know we used to

220
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,339
use data at my companies

221
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:39,479
um you know again I mentioned I was at

222
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,520
an ad tech company for a while you know

223
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,979
we'd pour your location over a map and

224
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,839
we'd know you went to Starbucks one two

225
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,820
three on Main Street

226
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,160
um we know you went to uh you know you

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,420
were shopping for a car because you went

228
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,220
to four car dealerships in two weekends

229
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,959
we also knew where you lived we knew

230
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,220
where you worked

231
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,720
um your cell phone was was at rest for

232
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,580
eight hours at night your cell phone was

233
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,899
at rest for eight hours during the day

234
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,700
we knew if you had kids and you were

235
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
dropping them off at school every day we

236
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,339
knew if you were sick because you were

237
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,680
going to a hospital every day and then

238
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,420
you start combining that with other sets

239
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,480
of data you know so we had a way to

240
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,640
enrich and authenticate our data we also

241
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,920
could do cross-device tracking to your

242
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,839
home devices

243
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,580
um you know you've got a TV at home

244
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,160
associated with an IP address we knew

245
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,779
you know all the things that you watched

246
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,399
on TV we could marry that to your cell

247
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,740
phone and your real world data it was

248
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,060
actually very easy and you could do that

249
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,980
about 10 years ago so it's not like it's

250
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,860
something you can just do today okay

251
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,339
I've also worked for a online gambling

252
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,440
app so you guys know DraftKings and

253
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,420
FanDuel I didn't work for one of those

254
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,360
companies but for regulatory purposes

255
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,580
those apps have to collect your location

256
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,200
data to make sure you are in a

257
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
jurisdiction that authorizes gambling

258
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,360
again a legitimate use case but those

259
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,980
regulations are written in such a way

260
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,260
that they persistently collect that data

261
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,220
they retain that data for a long time

262
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,600
sometimes indefinitely and that data is

263
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,519
accessible to government Regulators who

264
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,060
may then do whatever they do with it

265
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,220
you know to essentially make sure that

266
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,740
the company is complying with the

267
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,560
regulations but also you know who are

268
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,760
they sharing that data with I have no

269
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,220
idea

270
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,839
you know there's a there's a variety of

271
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,600
use cases out there that I think people

272
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,580
you know if you don't work in this space

273
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,500
and you don't think about all the

274
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,940
different ramifications and all the

275
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,140
different collection points and the

276
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,440
different ways to monetize this data

277
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,640
you know it's it's it can get very

278
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,980
complex very quickly yeah certainly and

279
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,019
we're going to get to the risk um so in

280
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,200
terms of uh like let's let's go ahead

281
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,420
and transition there like what are some

282
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,459
of so we've talked about you know

283
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,200
collection and use and what are these

284
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,180
practices what are some of the risks for

285
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,399
location data and what have you seen

286
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,920
being used in these areas to kind of

287
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,140
address those risks maybe start with

288
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,440
Uber all about the government uses

289
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,839
yeah so the government has plenty of

290
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,060
reason that it might want to know the

291
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,100
location of individuals I think one of

292
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,680
the most common and early uses of

293
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,079
real-time location data for government

294
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,420
entities and for historical data were

295
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,579
Departments of transportation that are

296
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,860
trying to sort of figure out where they

297
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,660
want to build New Roads whether they

298
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,279
need more sidewalks how many people are

299
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,839
riding their bicycles

300
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,779
but increasingly we're seeing uses by

301
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,339
law enforcement and that's where a lot

302
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:34,079
of my work focuses because you know the

303
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,779
a leaky design of a lot of these apps

304
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,040
and the consumer consent model that we

305
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,779
currently have around a lot of the

306
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,760
location Data Tracking is very

307
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,420
convenient for law enforcement who you

308
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,220
know members of which will regularly

309
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,899
reference how long it takes to go

310
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,720
through the proper channels in order to

311
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,399
determine where people's locations are

312
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,980
and so we know that on the federal level

313
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,380
the Department of Homeland Security and

314
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,480
Customs and Border Protection and a lot

315
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,519
of sort of the um

316
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,700
entities that deal across across

317
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,680
countries and across borders have used

318
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,260
this information to track individuals

319
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,120
but also we see local law enforcement

320
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
have access to it in a way that is sort

321
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,560
of very exciting for them because

322
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,660
otherwise there's a lot of paper that

323
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,640
needs to be generated in order to find

324
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,320
particular individuals or understand

325
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,540
where they are

326
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,660
um also a lot of the regulations you

327
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,220
know in addition to to warrants and

328
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,260
those sorts of things that they need to

329
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,300
follow regarding the retention of

330
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,880
particular uh data points right so if

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
we're thinking about automated license

332
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,380
plate readers or some of the other tools

333
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,360
that they have to try to basically track

334
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,700
people through time and keep a record of

335
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,300
it those data sets have in general some

336
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,800
sort of retention period that they're

337
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,740
supposed to be dealing with and and

338
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,480
um you know they get around that in a

339
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,100
lot of ways because they look to

340
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,540
third-party companies that are

341
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,820
collecting that information and

342
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,100
similarly we see this happening with

343
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,440
cell phone location data so I think

344
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,860
there are a lot of risks that we can

345
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,139
yeah and so so our panel we want to get

346
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,480
to anonymization of what what this

347
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,940
actually means for this space and so can

348
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,060
you uh Randy and Jen like kind of flesh

349
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,860
out some of the risks that you see that

350
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,779
are kind of go with the uses you talked

351
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:25,860
about

352
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,500
um a moment ago and the consumer's view

353
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,399
of it and then what can be done around

354
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,680
anonymization what is claimed to be done

355
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,560
and then what you know what is actually

356
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,200
practical from a a technical point of

357
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,040
view

358
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,339
really good okay

359
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,339
so from the consumer's point of view

360
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,339
um again you know there are I don't want

361
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,320
to write off the fact that there are

362
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,360
some really legitimate use cases for for

363
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,120
location uh data and obviously you know

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,399
we we all benefit from some of those

365
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,600
uses

366
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,459
um again but I think the bigger concern

367
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,380
is that there's a big difference between

368
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,959
you know giving me where my nearest

369
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,320
restaurant is uh versus you know keeping

370
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
that data for years and years and years

371
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
and years

372
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,180
um and that is the the theme we've we've

373
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,980
seen

374
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,019
uh with a lot of location data of

375
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,519
collectors

376
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,320
and that I think is part of what makes

377
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,060
it difficult to just assume that you can

378
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,100
hide in the crowd because I think a lot

379
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,540
of us just assume in the world of Big

380
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,399
Data like I'm not interesting I'm just a

381
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,899
single data point why am I going to

382
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,880
stick out uh you know the problem is

383
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
that location data collected over time

384
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,079
you know as Brandi was already talking

385
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,240
about it just reveals so much about your

386
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,060
life and I think if we've seen anything

387
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,000
in the last 10 years of following

388
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,279
internet privacy issues there's been a

389
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,560
real big shift from this kind of sense

390
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,019
that it's just about shopping who cares

391
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,060
like I'm just gonna get ads and it's

392
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,100
fine you know I want ads I want things

393
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,839
to be cheaper like it's the it's the

394
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,240
trade-off I'm willing to make it's great

395
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,519
um but I think that has really gone to

396
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,139
shift and people are becoming much more

397
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,699
aware that there's kind of a bigger cost

398
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,199
you're paying

399
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,820
um there's a couple issues I can think

400
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,500
of just off the top of my head you know

401
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,959
one is the recent Dobbs decision which

402
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,420
pushed back Ruby versus Wade you know so

403
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,459
suddenly you know very large population

404
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,920
of people who can be pregnant have

405
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,440
realized that especially if you are a

406
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,079
younger person in your 20s or 30s and

407
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,639
you're you know actively trying to

408
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,220
manage your fertility or seek abortion

409
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,199
care or anything in that realm you may

410
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,480
live in a state now where that is a

411
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,060
criminal act and your phone is one of

412
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,940
the easiest ways for law enforcement to

413
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,060
investigate and Trace that behavior so

414
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,500
you know suddenly this thing that you've

415
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,779
been relying on for convenience is

416
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,399
basically being weaponized against you

417
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,019
or has the capacity to be weaponized

418
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,360
against you and so for a lot of us that

419
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,480
is a very very visceral concern again

420
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,980
depending on what state you're in

421
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,380
obviously can I jump in there please

422
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,199
yeah um so I sit on the Minnesota

423
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,300
Department of transportations connected

424
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,120
in autonomous vehicles committee for

425
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,740
those of you who know your politics

426
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,019
Minnesota is a blue State surrounded by

427
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,899
Red States Minneapolis has a Planned

428
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,560
Parenthood Minnesota is a abortion Safe

429
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
Harbor State I believe they're in the

430
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,800
process of passing some additional laws

431
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,839
to protect women

432
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
um we are also 20 minutes in Minneapolis

433
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,639
from the Wisconsin border which is a

434
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,320
Republican state which has prohibited

435
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,800
and passed a number of abortion bans uh

436
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,240
I was sitting on this committee

437
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,880
listening to a conversation

438
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,399
um about you know again legitimate uses

439
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,399
urban planning Road replacing the gas

440
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,339
tax with the Usage Tax and you know

441
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,560
using location data to help generate you

442
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,940
know figure that out as we move to

443
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,600
electric vehicles things like that

444
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,160
and shortly after Dobbs came down I

445
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,440
asked the question who has access to all

446
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,880
this data and who's going to protect

447
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,160
this data from being sold because we now

448
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,139
have people not only in our state in

449
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:04,500
Minnesota who are now at risk are risk

450
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,140
calculus as women has changed half the

451
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,900
population

452
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,400
but you know we have people who are

453
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,559
going to be commuting over the Border in

454
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,119
from Iowa from The Dakotas from

455
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,220
Wisconsin all of which are Republican

456
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,339
states there now going to be crossing

457
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,980
the border to come to our state to use

458
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,720
our Planned Parenthood facilities and

459
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,059
other facilities for abortion rights and

460
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,400
if we are starting to track this data

461
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,140
and make this data available to a

462
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,240
variety of people are we also going to

463
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,679
share that data back with law

464
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,480
enforcement in other states as they try

465
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,260
to enforce those laws that most of the

466
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,419
committee you know this government

467
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:46,919
committee was men

468
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,260
uh most of them are you know we're older

469
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,419
and and I think I just stunned them all

470
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,039
into silence because none of them had

471
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,260
understood that something completely

472
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,720
unrelated can change your risk calculus

473
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,419
and this is you know everybody who knows

474
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:01,559
me who knows I've talked about this

475
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,000
space before nodes you know I call

476
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,880
location data digital plutonium you know

477
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,880
plutonium has a use right to power

478
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,220
um you know nuclear facilities there are

479
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,679
valid legitimate uses on some of the

480
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,179
stuff you know in terms of again the

481
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,340
urban planning the traffic you know

482
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,200
weather apps you know those are you know

483
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,760
crucial to you know people who live in

484
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,260
States like mine

485
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,299
but at the end of the day the risk you

486
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,919
know the risk factor of that get data

487
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,320
getting loose can be absolutely

488
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,600
devastating for people

489
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,140
um

490
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,419
yeah there's another case uh that I

491
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,059
wanted to just mention briefly uh which

492
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,059
I worked with one of the reporters who

493
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,780
reported this out was the case of a I

494
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,520
think he was a Catholic priest

495
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,020
um I don't think a priest or some other

496
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,820
uh former clergy uh who was you know

497
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,240
outed for uh for visiting gay bars and

498
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,740
you know part of that I mean the whole

499
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,960
way he was outed was through somebody

500
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,299
purchasing his location data I mean they

501
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,880
obviously knew who he was they were

502
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,500
suspicious that he was doing this you

503
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,360
know they were able to map his device

504
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,160
you know ID to a specific location

505
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,380
probably where he lived and then

506
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,360
specifically you know buy data for that

507
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,520
location identify his device and then

508
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,500
you know further by additional data to

509
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,539
you know track his his behavior over

510
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,299
time and then publicly outed for that

511
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,520
behavior just to kind of highlight the

512
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,679
point that you know

513
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,080
there's no laws preventing this right

514
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,559
now and so you know you may yourself say

515
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,480
I have nothing to hide you know why

516
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,100
should I be worried and I would just

517
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,539
make two points about that firstly

518
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,000
everybody has something to hide in the

519
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,919
sense that you don't necessarily want

520
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,080
every aspect of your life you know

521
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,120
available for purchase and publicized

522
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,919
even if you think I'm law abiding I

523
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,140
don't do anything strange

524
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,720
um you know the you know you still have

525
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,120
something in your life that you may find

526
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,039
you want to protect

527
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,440
um and you know from that as well it's

528
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,419
not just you it's everybody else in this

529
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,340
room it's everybody else around us you

530
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,080
know so you know part of I think the

531
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,179
real challenge here too is it is not

532
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,640
just about all of us as individuals our

533
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,520
location data is also used basically to

534
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,320
kind of inform on all of us and so it

535
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,240
becomes this Collective societal level

536
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,760
problem in terms of how our data is used

537
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,000
so even though I always have GPS turned

538
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,700
off on my phone if this panel is

539
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,799
probably not representative but if the

540
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,600
rest of you have it on

541
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,580
um you know and yet I also let's say I

542
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,500
don't turn off Bluetooth like there are

543
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,600
ways to basically triangulate kind of

544
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,340
where I've been based on where you all

545
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,799
have been as well so just to say that

546
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,960
like as much as I try to individually

547
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,820
fight this problem it's a collective

548
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,740
problem it involves all of us and the

549
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,660
way our data is used broadly and

550
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,880
collected broadly so there's only kind

551
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,799
of so much any one of us can do and that

552
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,660
I think is one of the kind of underlying

553
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,299
unfairness issues with the collection of

554
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,940
location data is again it's not so much

555
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,520
that like individual point in time it's

556
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,500
the aggregation of it you know across

557
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,080
time across boundaries you know not just

558
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,700
by a single company but by so many

559
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,980
companies and the ability to take that

560
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,840
data combine it with other data points

561
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,700
you know again all of this is so easy

562
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,760
too it is so unregulated and that's what

563
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,980
ends up kind of informing on all of us

564
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,020
so so when you really tease this out in

565
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,360
terms of like what anonymization would

566
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,660
look like like what would it look like

567
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,960
um and is it doable like is there a way

568
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,340
to get the benefit while drastically

569
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,520
reducing the risks for location data and

570
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,020
what you know what would that look like

571
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,879
from your Vantage points

572
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,039
I mean I've seen companies claim that

573
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,900
you can anonymize this data by

574
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,240
truncating you know the first and let's

575
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,159
say let's say you're taking a journey in

576
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,679
a car right you can truncate the start

577
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,480
you know the first five minutes of the

578
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,860
start of the journey in the first last

579
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,179
five minutes at the end of The Journey

580
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,940
I'm not sure I buy any of those

581
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,740
arguments to be honest with you because

582
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,600
you know the companies that claim that

583
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,880
they do that are also the same companies

584
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,500
that are out there saying hey we sell

585
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,419
this data to advertisers and I know for

586
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,400
a fact that the companies that the

587
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,260
advertisers want to know you went to

588
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,080
that Starbucks 123 on Main Street and if

589
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,280
you don't have the end point of that

590
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,659
Journey how can you tell that they went

591
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,820
to Starbucks one point uh you know one

592
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,980
two three on Main Street

593
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,679
um you know I've seen people use hashing

594
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,260
I've seen people use you know any number

595
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,440
of you know synonymous IDs I think you

596
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,580
know this is a pretty sophisticated

597
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,980
audience we know how easy it is to

598
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,679
unravel those we know how easy it is to

599
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,220
do probabilistic data matching so I you

600
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,200
know I hope somebody here has a better

601
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,179
technology than I do or a solution than

602
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,220
I do I have yet to see anything that can

603
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,039
really truly anonymize any of this data

604
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,900
I think

605
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,539
um you know the anonymization

606
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,220
particularly for law enforcement and

607
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,020
government feels to be sort of like a

608
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,240
wiggly space because there are certain

609
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,059
definitions that can be used and then as

610
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,159
long as you know law enforcement is not

611
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,740
stepping into those definitions they can

612
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,380
kind of proceed with this data so you

613
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,600
know one company that we've been

614
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,120
researching is a company called fog data

615
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,260
science and they seem to be

616
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,240
directly related to ventel based on

617
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,640
marketing materials that both companies

618
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,740
use bentel being another large data

619
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,919
broker that sells information to CBP and

620
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,480
DHS in general

621
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,480
and one of the things that they put as

622
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,700
their marketing to law enforcement is

623
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,039
that there's no personally identical and

624
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,260
identifiable information that is being

625
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,720
sold because this location data is not

626
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,620
being linked to a particular name or to

627
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,020
some in some cases a cell phone number

628
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,740
and so uh when it gets sold to law

629
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,140
enforcement law enforcement feels as

630
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,419
though they are not actually buying pii

631
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,980
because that is what they've been told

632
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,320
and that is sort of like the veneer that

633
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,440
has been placed around this data set but

634
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,480
we also know that law enforcement has

635
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,460
purchased this data or access to the

636
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,320
system which isn't just the data it's

637
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,539
like sort of a nice interface which they

638
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,220
can use to essentially geofence

639
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,460
particular locations and they have

640
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,559
acknowledged right like this is Haha

641
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,020
kind of pii but if we're any good at our

642
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,520
jobs we're going to be able to figure

643
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,080
out who these people are and it's

644
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
obvious that they're trying to find

645
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,559
particular individuals because one of

646
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,080
the main reasons that they'll use is to

647
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,120
try to access this information is

648
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,120
something like human trafficking so

649
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,120
um when we think about sort of yeah

650
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,400
whether it's possible to anonymize data

651
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,280
it seems basically not and anonymization

652
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,220
is kind of a way to pass information

653
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,380
along that would otherwise be obviously

654
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,100
too sensitive

655
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,940
so I did a little bit of kind of

656
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,400
research review before uh today's event

657
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,700
I mean I just you find consistently you

658
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,380
know paper after paper after paper where

659
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,460
people are arguing that they can

660
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,020
re-identify

661
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,080
um through location data uh and

662
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,179
I mean I think it's it's a couple things

663
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,400
again it's it's how long data is

664
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,419
collected

665
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,580
um it's how long you keep it for and

666
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,260
it's your capacity to also bring in

667
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,140
outside information and you know to the

668
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,120
extent that I mean I think Brandy's

669
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,039
experience is probably illustrative I

670
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,240
mean companies make all these claims

671
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,760
about anonymizing data but I mean at the

672
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,320
end of the day if you buy an anonymized

673
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,179
data set I'm assuming that it's trivial

674
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,520
to then buy additional data to enhance

675
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,980
it and to try to re-identify people like

676
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,720
we just don't have guard rails kind of

677
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,100
in place to prevent these things from

678
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,020
happening as part of the challenge yeah

679
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,000
I mean let's be real like you said we

680
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
don't have the guard rails we don't have

681
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,419
the laws to protect against this we

682
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,039
don't have you know something like a

683
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,980
bippa right but the Illinois biometric

684
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,159
information protection act

685
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:57,900
what we have are noticing consent laws

686
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,120
here largely that are based on a privacy

687
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,159
policy and as I jokingly tell people

688
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,020
having written about 500 of these over

689
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,700
the last decade

690
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,220
um I'm sorry yeah I know right I I tell

691
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,659
my friends I write the things that

692
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,460
nobody AIDS click yes to accept

693
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,039
you know and I read them if that helps

694
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,080
the only people that read them in fact I

695
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,659
was reading the NFLs at a basketball at

696
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,640
an NBA game so hey I guess I'm That Kind

697
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,340
of nerd but you know like realistically

698
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,500
the the consents for these things are

699
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,860
buried in in privacy policies and you

700
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,679
know it is so so easy to re-identify and

701
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,659
rematch data you know hypothetically you

702
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,580
know I'll give you an example if I have

703
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,159
the the geolocation the GPS coordinates

704
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:44,159
of you know my device which is sitting

705
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,520
at my house I bought a house last year

706
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,440
um my house is you know is now public

707
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,539
record right there's a deed with the cut

708
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,400
with the county

709
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,020
um you know for tax purposes and

710
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,279
everything and it's got my name on it

711
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,539
and that's you know you can go down and

712
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,039
buy that information that's what home

713
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,779
warranty companies do when they sell you

714
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,460
all those uh home warranty things and

715
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,900
send them into you in the mail all the

716
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,640
time

717
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,159
um you know the DMV has my address on

718
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,919
file and the DMV leaks like a sieve they

719
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:12,960
sell data like no tomorrow in every

720
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,059
state it doesn't matter now you can

721
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,820
combine that GPS location which you have

722
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,340
on a map with you know all of this

723
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,200
deterministic data that's available for

724
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,240
sale for pretty cheap and as you know

725
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,700
the tools are very easy to to recombine

726
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,919
that with you don't even have to go and

727
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,679
get you know fancy IP addresses or other

728
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,740
identifiers ad IDs idfas AIDS you can

729
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,720
just literally go and buy public records

730
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,279
and that's what's happening at these

731
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,460
data Brokers and I think this is why you

732
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,140
know not not to put Aaron on the spot

733
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,000
here but this is why the coachava case

734
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,299
is really really interesting right now

735
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,400
because the data Brokers are making this

736
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,559
data available so you know to everybody

737
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,020
private sector you know that grinder

738
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,279
case you were I think it was Grinders

739
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,340
where the data came from in that case

740
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,080
down in Texas with the Catholic priest

741
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,120
you know that data was acquired from a

742
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,940
data broker who got their data from the

743
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,900
DMV and from grinder and other apps

744
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,460
you know and I think

745
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,679
you know this is where you know data

746
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,480
leaks like a sieve it goes everywhere

747
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,059
once it's out there on the internet

748
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,700
um you know it's so easy and and as we

749
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,440
can tell from all of the ransomware and

750
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,779
the hacking uh you know that's you know

751
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,340
kind of pretty constant these days I

752
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,140
don't think you can you go on the social

753
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,940
media and not see that there's you know

754
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,279
another data breach this data is not

755
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,320
just in the hands of you know quote

756
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,600
unquote legitimate data brokers who have

757
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,980
a legitimate business model and

758
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,840
theoretically a license to the data to

759
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,840
resell it but they also have you know

760
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,760
all these Bad actors who have access to

761
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,200
the data so I think you know this

762
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,179
coachava case is going to be extremely

763
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:51,000
interesting in terms of the geolocation

764
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,679
sector and whether or not they're able

765
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,039
to you know kind of limit Downstream the

766
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,080
ability of companies to resell and

767
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,539
recombine that data with other data sets

768
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,820
yeah and I I should say these views are

769
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,440
mine and not those of the Federal Trade

770
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,020
Commission uh but I I will say that you

771
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,120
know without commenting on any specifics

772
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,640
of ongoing litigation I encourage you

773
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,380
all to look at the public complaint that

774
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,799
the FTC filed against kochava it's on

775
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,799
ftc.gov if you search for kotava and

776
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,159
it's about the unfair sale of sensitive

777
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,220
location data and I will say no more

778
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,140
about that other than please read the

779
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,679
complaint it's very visceral and gives a

780
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,980
lot of details

781
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:39,539
um so I want to add right when um law

782
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:42,120
enforcement is accessing this data they

783
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,159
are in addition to feeling as though

784
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,039
there's no pii involved you know they're

785
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,140
receiving it under the impression that

786
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,380
it is 100 opt-in consent for whatever

787
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,080
that is worth as we've heard

788
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,880
um and two things that I really want to

789
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,039
highlight right are that

790
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,000
um one laws change and two police are

791
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,159
people and people are people right and

792
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:08,000
so if we're thinking about access to

793
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,980
abortion care or health care in general

794
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,899
if we're thinking about different

795
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,600
political issues that have obviously

796
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,880
been cropping up in our country whether

797
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,700
that be elections or immigration the

798
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,559
fact that law enforcement can access

799
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,399
this information and without proper uh

800
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,740
oversight in such a way that it's not as

801
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,000
though they are going through the

802
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,100
warrant process in in some of these

803
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,460
cases any random police officer can sort

804
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,520
of geofence any random location and have

805
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,500
a sense of which devices were in those

806
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,539
locations and so there's a huge risk

807
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:44,039
when it comes to law enforcement but

808
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,559
also because just the consumer Market is

809
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,899
so open we're seeing situations in which

810
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,179
right this information has been bought

811
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,760
and used to try to demonstrate that

812
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,340
there has been election tampering I have

813
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,640
one recent and very scary use case that

814
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,279
has happened in the last couple of

815
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,860
months has been related to non-profits

816
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,020
and under other individuals who are

817
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,539
helping people who are coming into this

818
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,360
country from the southern border and you

819
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,799
know there's been one organization that

820
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,840
has bought this information geofenced to

821
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,580
the locations of different immigration

822
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,740
detention centers and then tracked all

823
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,240
of the people who came in and out of

824
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,460
those detention centers and as part of

825
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,360
that

826
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,200
um

827
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,059
you know so-called report that they were

828
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:29,100
working on they acknowledged that they

829
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,620
obtained this information without being

830
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,779
clear about where they obtained it but

831
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,880
that they were able to track individuals

832
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,039
to their homes and to other locations

833
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,260
and don't worry you know we know that

834
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,000
those people aren't the undocumented

835
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,860
immigrants that we're referring to those

836
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,480
are just people that we know are helping

837
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,520
them and so you can imagine a use case

838
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,159
you know where somebody has doesn't even

839
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,659
necessarily need to know who these

840
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,919
people are they just know that these

841
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,179
people have a different political view

842
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,039
than they have and they don't like it

843
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,320
yeah it's the the bleeding of this and

844
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,940
the politics is really becoming a thing

845
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,500
I mean I I was tracking the use of

846
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,899
location data by political campaigns you

847
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:05,159
know which is much more around like

848
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,899
geofencing at rallies and trying to

849
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:08,520
figure out like who's showing up for

850
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,100
targeting you you know for fundraising

851
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,419
but I think you raised the really good

852
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:13,919
point that we're also seeing this

853
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,779
weaponized because there are lots of

854
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,340
we'll say dark money groups out there

855
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,100
that are kind of willing to fund uh you

856
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,919
know people on the ground uh and you

857
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:23,940
know especially look at things like

858
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,100
school boards for example like a lot of

859
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,960
the races and different school boards

860
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,980
around the country are becoming

861
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,320
extremely political and it's not just

862
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,120
kind of the politics I think the local

863
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,399
politics but it's also the fact that

864
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:37,020
you're seeing other players get involved

865
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,460
in the space and willing to kind of put

866
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,779
the money in to say well let's find out

867
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,940
who the opposition is and kind of

868
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,679
involve people in opposition research so

869
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,299
like I said earlier I think it's really

870
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,520
going beyond the consumer boundaries of

871
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,220
just my shopping habits into kind of

872
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,260
really darker space that I think you

873
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,179
know potentially can affect much people

874
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,240
much more personally and viscerally than

875
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,059
simply you know I get too much spam now

876
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:02,279
we've also seen reporters have their

877
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,799
geolocation tracked as well while

878
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,140
they're trying to meet with sources and

879
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,460
they're reporting on you know

880
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,080
particularly sensitive issues those

881
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,960
stories have been cropping up for years

882
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,240
we've also seen you know this data being

883
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,980
available

884
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,440
um on you know like I said both the the

885
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
data Brokers and on you know quote

886
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,419
unquote the dark web after it's been

887
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,279
breached we're seeing this used in

888
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:29,460
National Security right your fitbits a

889
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,200
few years ago we we saw the New York

890
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,620
Times did a series of exposes where they

891
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,899
had to ban Strava and fitbits from

892
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,179
military bases because the guys were

893
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,100
running around laps and they were

894
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,720
running around the out out you know the

895
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,860
boundaries of the base and they were

896
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,179
based you could basically use their

897
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:47,100
their location data to map out a base

898
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,019
we've seen people tracked from Langley

899
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:51,179
in those stories where the CIA

900
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,700
headquarters are you know we've seen

901
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,640
people tracked from the Supreme Court

902
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,580
back to their homes so you know like the

903
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,279
this particular data is you know

904
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,140
weaponized both domestically by these

905
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,519
political parties many of which are

906
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,679
organized as 501 c-3s and other

907
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,839
organizations

908
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,460
um and I you know I should point out

909
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,839
that you know we have all these modern

910
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,879
privacy laws coming into effect you know

911
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,639
we've got California with the CCPA we've

912
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,040
got Utah Connecticut Colorado and

913
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,080
Virginia going into effect this year and

914
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,000
more states have proposed privacy laws

915
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,040
but almost all of those laws have carve

916
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,480
outs for nonprofits that they don't

917
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,359
apply so any of these new laws that

918
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,460
apply to

919
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,260
um you know that would cover this

920
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,418
geolocation data that would put purpose

921
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,699
limitations and minimization on them

922
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,339
would require cyber security protections

923
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,440
and you know dpias and dsars and all

924
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,179
these other acronyms of you know things

925
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,219
that we do to mitigate risk they have

926
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,440
huge carve outs for a lot of the

927
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,020
entities that use this data and I just

928
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,699
want to piggyback you know Circle back

929
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,918
to the whole consent issue

930
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,140
let's be realistic when you open a

931
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,220
weather app

932
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,440
and you consent to the use of your

933
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,839
location data for a weather app

934
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,520
you're using it to get the weather in

935
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,260
your location

936
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,240
my mom does not understand that she is

937
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,980
now consenting to sell that data

938
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,280
Downstream to a number of data Brokers

939
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,380
consent is the fiction at the center of

940
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,660
our of our profession

941
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,700
it's a fiction because if my mother

942
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,380
doesn't understand what she's consenting

943
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,339
to

944
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,859
then it's not a valid consent

945
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,960
and none of the consent strings and none

946
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,460
of the consents that are being collected

947
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,780
and none of the consents that any of

948
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,760
these people are relying on

949
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,780
mean a damn thing

950
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,480
do you want to pick up being spicy oh no

951
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,520
I I absolutely do you want to Jen do you

952
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,020
want to pick up on that so one of my

953
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,440
questions in transitioning to so what do

954
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,540
we do what is the regulatory landscape

955
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,359
look like what is it for an individual

956
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,820
what does that landscape look like I

957
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,599
kind of want to start with the

958
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,579
individual like what what can an

959
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:59,520
individual do in this situation if

960
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,859
anything

961
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:04,619
to mitigate the risks of their uh their

962
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,800
own location data being collected and

963
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,820
used sure I mean turning off GPS on your

964
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,380
phone when you're not using it you know

965
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,660
is a very small thing you can do but you

966
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,579
know it does take some data out of

967
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,079
circulation

968
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,460
um you know do you also want to turn off

969
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,680
Bluetooth in every public space like you

970
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,660
know it becomes this long list of like

971
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,300
hygiene that you have to try to remember

972
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,619
I'm usually good with GPS I'm not always

973
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,720
good with Bluetooth personally I mean

974
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,400
starting at the micro level

975
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,900
um I mean we could go back to dumb

976
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,940
phones that's what I bought my 13 year

977
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,040
old he wasn't very happy about it but

978
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,480
tough

979
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,079
um

980
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,060
he uses the phone a lot less than his

981
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,740
friends I will tell you that pretty sure

982
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,720
that's pretty sure the drug dealers also

983
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,400
use dumb phones I think there's a there

984
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,480
was an article out there about them

985
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,160
loving the candy bar phones from yeah

986
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,500
back like the Nokia's from like 15 years

987
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,960
ago definitely

988
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,060
um I mean

989
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,040
so I always get asked these types of

990
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,359
questions from the press and it's a

991
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,380
really tough one because as an

992
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,520
individual I mean I think I just

993
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,900
highlights some somewhat some of the

994
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,520
futility there's only so much you can do

995
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,079
are you going to read all the Privacy

996
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:10,079
policies not likely even if you did is

997
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,420
there anything you can do no not really

998
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,700
other than not use whatever service you

999
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,740
know you you want to use you have no

1000
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,900
negotiation rights there

1001
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,579
um so

1002
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,140
what can you do

1003
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,540
um you know hopefully this Congressional

1004
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,000
session we may see adpa come back into

1005
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,460
play which is the um Federal level

1006
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,920
Privacy Law that was proposed last

1007
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,359
session

1008
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,740
um it's kind of controversial to say

1009
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,540
here in California but I'll just you

1010
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,480
know we do need a federal level law

1011
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,579
um so we'll see if that gets any

1012
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,920
traction this time around I mean I think

1013
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,599
bigger picture you know you know the

1014
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,160
first level I think is going to actually

1015
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,640
get some regulations in place and some

1016
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,440
boundaries in place over what can be

1017
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,820
collected and what it can be used for

1018
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,800
and how long it could be kept like that

1019
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,560
will help at least somewhat I think in

1020
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,359
terms of kind of the runaway collection

1021
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,760
and sale we see today

1022
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,760
um I think in a longer term scenario the

1023
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,260
consent question is still a really

1024
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,700
relevant one

1025
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,740
um you know we haven't mentioned

1026
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,960
um Apple's ad tracking transparency

1027
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,420
measure you know that's had extremely

1028
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,240
huge uptake from what we can tell or at

1029
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,680
least what kind of people from the

1030
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,660
outside are telling us

1031
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,880
um so you know when I hear a lot of like

1032
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,619
well consumers don't care it's like well

1033
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,300
actually if you put the choice in front

1034
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,520
of them most of us say no we don't want

1035
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,920
to be tracked and so consumers do care

1036
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,680
if actually given a real choice and not

1037
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,040
just a false choice but longer term you

1038
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,440
know I think one of the areas that I I

1039
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,180
tend to focus on in my research is

1040
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,680
trying to think through like how do we

1041
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,140
change the entire data ecosystem like

1042
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,180
how do we change all this

1043
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,400
um you know I think we ultimately we

1044
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,200
need to shift away from Models where

1045
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,660
companies collect our data and that we

1046
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,240
basically have zero control over it to

1047
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,640
one where we generally are the stewards

1048
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,440
of our own data or we have data

1049
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,480
intermediaries that Steward that data

1050
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,420
and that basically you know we delegate

1051
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,579
our kind of decision making to a data

1052
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,320
intermediary in terms of what do I want

1053
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,240
shared who do I want to share it with

1054
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,820
and we take so much of this out of these

1055
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,839
high-stakes consent models that as

1056
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,800
Brandy and Barrel have really pointed

1057
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,480
out like they don't make any sense none

1058
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,160
of us read this stuff and again it's

1059
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,599
mostly false consent we don't understand

1060
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,960
we're being asked and it's you know it's

1061
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,060
too complex of an issue and so part of

1062
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,680
this is rethinking I would argue the

1063
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,619
entire data ecosystem and shifting more

1064
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,060
towards

1065
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,099
data that's more directly under our

1066
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,380
control and maybe that we license out

1067
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,359
for use and a lot of people talk about

1068
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,460
this in ownership terms you need to own

1069
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,560
your own data I'm sorry to throw cold

1070
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,820
water on that it's not really about

1071
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,400
ownership per se it's the more unsexy

1072
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,040
term of Licensing but it is much more of

1073
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,020
like you're licensing your data for use

1074
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,480
by others maybe you get financial direct

1075
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,400
Financial benefits from it

1076
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,300
um you know that's one of the things

1077
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,859
that's often kind of circulating in the

1078
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,480
space if I own my own data I can like

1079
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,160
get paid for it

1080
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,420
um unfortunately probably won't get paid

1081
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,040
much but

1082
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,720
um but really we're talking about kind

1083
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,940
of Shifting the terms fundamentally so

1084
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,220
that it's less about like every actor in

1085
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,140
this universe that's you know having at

1086
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,420
stake at trying to get your data and you

1087
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,920
potentially having more direct control

1088
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,079
and you know more broadly time to decide

1089
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,119
who you who you share with and under

1090
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,880
what conditions so so what what would it

1091
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,599
take to achieve that Vision

1092
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,420
uh you know if you pull all the levers

1093
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,040
you know the legal levers the company

1094
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,440
practices levers and why not like what

1095
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,480
what what would what's needed to pave

1096
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,760
the way for that Vision so there are

1097
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,260
actually companies in this space I don't

1098
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,520
know if there's anybody in this space in

1099
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,320
this room I mean we're seeing these

1100
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,900
models I think begin to emerge in the

1101
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,180
B2B space to some extent

1102
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,920
um in big research projects I think

1103
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,980
there's been more of a focus on

1104
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,540
um trying to think about how we kind of

1105
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,880
build the term we use a lot of data

1106
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,859
trusts how do you build a Data Trust you

1107
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,180
know that still gives kind of the people

1108
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,460
in that data set writes over their data

1109
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,079
uh you know I think there's some

1110
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,460
momentum beginning to build in this

1111
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,380
space but honestly I think the big nudge

1112
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,240
would be let's say a government

1113
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,280
regulator telling a company they had to

1114
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,579
divest their data as part of an you know

1115
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,839
anti-monopoly measure quite honestly

1116
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,940
like that would be the big kick I think

1117
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,380
that would actually really get this

1118
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,280
moving

1119
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,720
um I realize that's probably a very

1120
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,880
controversial thing to say but

1121
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,460
um you know and tell the momentum builds

1122
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,619
I think you know data divestiture might

1123
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,060
be one of the things that actually kicks

1124
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,400
it over the threshold I I love that and

1125
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,320
discouragement of profits

1126
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,940
just putting it out there if it's going

1127
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,320
to cost you a lot of money to do

1128
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,000
something that's very bad from a privacy

1129
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,579
perspective and not just say a five

1130
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,040
billion dollar fine when um you know

1131
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,660
your company makes what 100 billion

1132
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,520
dollars a quarter

1133
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,839
um you know that that can feel like a

1134
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,400
little bit of a slap on the wrist and a

1135
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,680
cost of doing business and I think we

1136
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,060
all know who I'm referring to with that

1137
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,220
five billion dollar fine uh thank you

1138
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,680
for sponsoring our conference

1139
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,240
um

1140
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,320
I want to put it out there too that one

1141
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,880
of the

1142
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,740
others are so

1143
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,880
is the econ

1144
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,260
's of the internet

1145
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,940
economics of these companies are built

1146
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,339
on on advertising and advertising is

1147
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,280
built on personal data and so at a

1148
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,020
certain level we are fighting the

1149
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,180
economics of the internet we're fighting

1150
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,160
the economics of the Venture capitalists

1151
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,200
and trillions of dollars invested in ad

1152
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,599
Tech we're fighting Google also thank

1153
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,420
you for sponsoring our conference

1154
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,920
um you know and I think there are you

1155
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,780
know some really hard challenges in

1156
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,460
terms of how do we Finance our our

1157
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,079
development costs because you know let's

1158
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,700
be real none of us are cheap in this

1159
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,079
room

1160
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,180
um and and certainly office space and

1161
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,859
computers and you know servers and

1162
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,839
things like that are not free so I think

1163
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,400
there are some very serious challenges

1164
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,680
in terms of how we conceptualize the

1165
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,960
economics of the internet and and how we

1166
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,880
you know privacy is wrapped around those

1167
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,040
those issues and that's why you know I

1168
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,300
kind of always say you know something

1169
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,460
something up in Sinclair

1170
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,140
um I think Upton Sinclair was quoted as

1171
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,880
saying you know it's difficult to get a

1172
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,800
man to understand that which is paycheck

1173
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,099
relies upon him not understanding

1174
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,260
um so you know I I know we're kind of

1175
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,579
running short on time here but I wanted

1176
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:12,960
to throw one other thing back at you

1177
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,599
Barrel you know with your expertise with

1178
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,180
the government which is you know I

1179
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,940
really think we have to do a better job

1180
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,220
of making sure that the government

1181
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,800
cannot just buy this data and making

1182
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,180
sure that the government departments

1183
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,280
that have access to this data cannot

1184
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,980
share it with other departments

1185
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,960
um you know I think location data you

1186
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,640
know as I said before digital plutonium

1187
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,640
is is so extremely dangerous in terms of

1188
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,400
what it can you know expose people to

1189
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,579
from a risk perspective and so you know

1190
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:45,900
I don't know if you have any thoughts

1191
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,280
about that

1192
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,079
um in terms of the the government side

1193
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:50,940
of this but none of these you know none

1194
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,800
of these laws apply to government you

1195
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,300
know CCPA et cetera don't apply to

1196
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,040
government right yeah I think we're

1197
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,020
fighting against the economics but right

1198
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,240
the government also has an interest in

1199
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,060
allowing this to continue to be bought

1200
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,220
and sold and so even when we're thinking

1201
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,500
about the American you know the

1202
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,200
uh data Privacy Act that didn't get

1203
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,660
through last Congressional session

1204
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,760
um you know one of the sort of uh

1205
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,420
definitional wiggle spaces in that bill

1206
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,220
which eff didn't support as it was

1207
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,240
written

1208
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,160
um had to do with the fact that some of

1209
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,720
these data Brokers were just sort of

1210
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,700
reclassified as some sort of service

1211
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,680
provider which would have allowed them

1212
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,180
to continue to basically do the same

1213
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,440
thing you know a government service

1214
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,940
provider

1215
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,480
um and so you know I think uh short and

1216
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,240
you know with that with that law it was

1217
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,920
going to sort of

1218
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,660
um undermine some of the existing state

1219
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,220
laws and so I think there are there is

1220
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,480
action on the state level that can

1221
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,160
happen and there are sort of like pieces

1222
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,260
of the puzzle or bytes that can be taken

1223
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,880
at the state level right um you know

1224
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,940
California has passed a law that won't

1225
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,700
allow the sharing of information with

1226
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,220
States other states that are going to be

1227
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:02,520
using it for abortion prosecutions and

1228
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,319
so if there are sort of specific ways

1229
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,599
that laws can get put on the books that

1230
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:08,819
sort of limit some of the ways that the

1231
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,859
information is bought and sold I think

1232
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,240
we can make a little bit of progress but

1233
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,680
I agree that there needs to be some sort

1234
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,440
of overarching Standards because

1235
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,420
um it's a lot for local law enforcement

1236
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,880
and for state law enforcement to you

1237
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,099
know they don't always 100 know what the

1238
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,380
laws are so they're not always totally

1239
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,480
following them and we're seeing just

1240
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,400
across the surveillance space in general

1241
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,319
right the use of these third-party

1242
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:33,420
companies to collect the information on

1243
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,220
behalf of the government and then resell

1244
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,260
it to the government is huge and it does

1245
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,180
sort of bypass a lot of the laws that

1246
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,280
exist when it comes to sort of cross

1247
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,220
jurisdictional information sharing so

1248
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,619
um yeah it's a bit of a widened proposed

1249
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,500
along yeah oh yeah go ahead sorry no I'm

1250
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,520
just going to say widen propose

1251
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,140
something last year but I guess yeah

1252
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,579
with the chances that they're being

1253
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,500
passed are right yeah I don't know

1254
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,359
exactly what the chances are of anything

1255
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,920
being passed but it would be nice if the

1256
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,599
fourth amendment is not for sale act

1257
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,240
would get through because it does try to

1258
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,700
address some of these issues and sort of

1259
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,160
speaks to in its in its name the problem

1260
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,720
that we're seeing which is that the

1261
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,920
Fourth Amendment protections that we're

1262
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,720
supposed to have in the Constitution are

1263
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,540
being circumvented because uh capitalism

1264
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,940
can I just tie this all back globally

1265
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,040
too so I don't know if any of you guys

1266
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,680
know who Max schrems is and have been

1267
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,079
dealing with shrem's too and

1268
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,359
cross-border data transfer and you know

1269
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,960
this the collapse of multiple treaties

1270
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,240
that allow data to be shared from the EU

1271
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,819
to the U.S but the fact that we are

1272
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:37,980
undermining our own Fourth Amendment

1273
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,839
protections here in the United States

1274
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,079
actually has an impact on our ability to

1275
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:46,200
operate multinationals there's a a very

1276
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,180
negative you know impact from a

1277
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,400
commercial perspective in terms of being

1278
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,099
able to you know run that run our

1279
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:55,079
businesses because we're not protecting

1280
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,300
privacy at home and I don't think this

1281
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,940
point gets made enough that we need to

1282
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,520
do a better job of protecting U.S

1283
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,619
citizens and other people who live here

1284
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,900
and the data that is brought here from

1285
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,780
overseas fees you know when we allow

1286
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,700
these kind of loopholes to circumvent

1287
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,040
that undermines our ability to work with

1288
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,140
other countries like in other regions

1289
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,200
like the European Union and you know the

1290
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,540
UK with UK gdpr and all these other

1291
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,400
countries with GDP are like laws because

1292
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,200
they don't want to transfer the data to

1293
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,020
us because we're not a safe jurisdiction

1294
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,300
so you know these are problems we have

1295
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,180
to solve for International Business to

1296
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,280
proceed this isn't just like a civil

1297
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,079
liberties problem I'm not standing on my

1298
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:38,880
soapbox as a liberal trying to protect

1299
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,160
you know women's rights or you know

1300
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,660
individual I'm also thinking about this

1301
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,880
like from how do I scale a business and

1302
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,500
operate globally if I can't bring that

1303
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,359
data back here well now I got to park

1304
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:50,760
servers in the EU but access is a

1305
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,839
transformation so now I gotta Park

1306
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,700
Personnel in the EU so now we have a

1307
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,859
growth and we have a huge systemic

1308
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,200
problem to expand and grow our

1309
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,420
businesses uh you know and it doubles

1310
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,280
and triples and quadruples our costs of

1311
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,839
doing business globally and I know

1312
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,920
there's a lot of people in this room

1313
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,599
that are thinking about scaling problems

1314
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:08,880
and operating internationally so I do

1315
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,079
want to you know make sure we tie that

1316
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,040
back

1317
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,900
so so we so we talk about what to do

1318
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,420
about this problem and the ranges are

1319
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,780
blow up the economics of the internet

1320
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,300
change the whole data ecosystem

1321
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,420
um world peace World Peace um I I'm

1322
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,579
curious like we have about a minute and

1323
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:28,560
a half till questions

1324
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,619
um what you know if you were to really

1325
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:35,160
take like kind of the most powerful one

1326
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,220
practice or thing that you could do from

1327
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:41,460
a like legal standpoint or from a you

1328
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,060
know a new law or a or whatnot like what

1329
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,680
would that be that would have the

1330
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:48,119
highest

1331
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,060
um reduction of privacy risk in this

1332
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,880
space to start

1333
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,359
Federal bippa but for location data okay

1334
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,819
and can you just briefly say like what

1335
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:01,200
that would do and why that's important

1336
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,540
companies are terrified of bipa because

1337
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,300
of the cost of a class action litigation

1338
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,960
right just once you get past

1339
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,359
um once you get to the Discovery phase

1340
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,060
the cost of litigation Skyrocket and

1341
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,319
you're talking millions of dollars in

1342
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,060
lawyers you're talking millions of

1343
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,380
dollars in dock review you're talking

1344
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,000
people taken away from doing their jobs

1345
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,560
and sitting in depositions you don't

1346
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,440
even have to get to litigation that

1347
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,040
class action threat makes bippa the most

1348
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,020
effective Privacy Law in this country

1349
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,140
by far and you're just now seeing I

1350
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,760
think the ramifications of that if we

1351
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,619
had a federal level because bitpa's

1352
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,660
Illinois only if we had a federal level

1353
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,859
location law with with that kind of

1354
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:45,300
enforcement attached to it because

1355
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,740
that's the key right it's enforcement

1356
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,319
it's cost it's making a harm for doing

1357
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,780
bad things with this type of data that

1358
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,760
would see companies be more responsible

1359
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,560
you know you have to have some teeth

1360
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,420
behind this

1361
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,700
I would land somewhere between really

1362
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,280
strict limits on how long data is kept I

1363
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:03,300
mean

1364
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,760
um I'm really strict like what I say

1365
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,619
hours would I say days would I even go a

1366
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:08,819
week I don't know I need to really think

1367
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:10,079
about it

1368
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,680
um and you know some potentially some

1369
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,380
form of consumer engagement where

1370
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,480
consumers are actually given a very

1371
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,760
explicit Clear Choice on kind of like do

1372
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,380
I want it collected do I want it sold

1373
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,780
how long do I want it kept for

1374
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,460
um because again we're seeing with with

1375
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,920
with iOS and AD tracking transparency

1376
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,260
that people are giving them the choice

1377
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,339
you know they're generally making

1378
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:33,420
decisions

1379
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,280
um kind of Highly in favor of being more

1380
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,119
restrictive in this area

1381
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,680
yeah I think I would go for maybe a

1382
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,560
combination of these I think it would be

1383
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,339
um

1384
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:46,740
it would be nice if I as an individual

1385
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,380
could say I only consented to you having

1386
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,480
my information and now that you've sold

1387
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,880
that or you bought it I can come after

1388
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,160
you because you're essentially stalking

1389
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,960
me and you've sold this very important

1390
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,000
you know important information so I

1391
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,119
think if there were some mechanism like

1392
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,579
a law that would allow me as an

1393
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:08,819
individual to say uh you know this

1394
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:11,520
information is mine and only mine unless

1395
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,440
I very clearly said to you you could

1396
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,819
have it

1397
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:17,280
um that would be very cool and with that

1398
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,839
I think we're at time I want to thank

1399
00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:21,000
each and each of you thank you so much

1400
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,380
for the thoughtful panel and for your

1401
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,940
time and expertise
