00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,660
and now the fake news our top story

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,680
today

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,260
notorious ransomware operator lockbit

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,420
issued an apology just before the new

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,460
year over a ransomware attack that one

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,679
of its customers had committed against

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,620
Toronto's hospital for sick children

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,120
block that said it had blocked the

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,800
partner responsible for the attack from

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,360
continuing to use lockbit Services

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,879
lockbit also offered the hospital a free

13
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,340
decrypter tool to unlock its data an

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,620
unusual offer that kept both lockbit and

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,480
the now blocked partner for monetizing

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,620
the attack

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,300
reached for comment the head of one

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,700
major U.S hospital system condemned

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,980
lockbit saying this just goes to show

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,260
how socialized medicine harms the free

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,520
market

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,800
happened in America those kids never

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,000
would have gotten valuable Healthcare

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,580
I.T services for free

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,200
the Ontario government likewise

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,060
criticized lockbit for breaking the law

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,280
with with its malicious software because

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,080
the ransom message was displayed only in

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,979
English and not also in French

30
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,060
beyond that the government spokesperson

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,040
said we Canadians don't really mind

32
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,180
organized crime because it's organized

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,840
[Laughter]

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,700
speaking of cyber security incidents the

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,020
Federal Trade Commission this week

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,420
released new guidance for Americans on

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,220
how to avoid being victimized by data

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,479

Commission chair Gary Gensler who's long

42
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,259
advocated for stricter regulation of

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,079
launching a campaign of public service

46
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,360
announcements modeled on the famous this

47
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,520
is your brain on drugs PSAs from the

48

1980s and 90s

49
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,140
in the first of the new PSAs a man holds

50
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,180
up a roll of hundred dollar bills and

51
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,820
says this is your money he then says

52
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,320
this is your money on a crypto exchange

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,119

pocket and runs away

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,340
and now for the weather a series of

56
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,260
heavy rainstorms this month led to

57
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,120
flooding in many parts of Northern

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,340
California among the affected areas the

59
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,160
popular Resort town of Guerneville the

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,480
federal government has confidently

61
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,099
attributed the source of the flooding to

62
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,500
the Russian River an earlier mistaken

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,060
attribution to the North Korean River

64
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,560
has been chalked up to a false flag

River an apt dubbing at muddy bear which

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,879
coincidentally is also the name of a gay

bar in Guerneville

in DC news

72
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,680
last month Congress passed an

73
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,060
Appropriations bill that included a

74
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,400
landmark in the first ever mentioned in

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,099
federal law of memory safety the law

76
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,420
encourages the office of the national

77
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,280
cyber director to investigate memory

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,540
safety within the federal government

79
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,940
it's another sign of the U.S

80
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,500
government's emphasis on cyber security

81
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,780
under President Joe Biden

82
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,120
as for his thoughts on the topic former

83
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,560
president Donald Trump said he thought

84
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,480
memory safety meant when your ethics

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,819
lawyer coaches one of your aides to tell

86
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,560
the January 6 committee I don't recall

87
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,300
in response to every question they ask

88
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,580
her if she can't remember then I must be

89
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,260
safe

90
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,300
in privacy news the California privacy

91
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,640
Rights Act or cpra for short took effect

92
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,159
on January 1st for those of you

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,959
scrambling to get into compliance you've

94
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,400
got some Breathing Room an obscure

95
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,019
provision of the law the latest civil

96
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,060
and Ministry of enforcement until July

97
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,019
1st

98
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,700
another little known clause in the law

99
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,860
starting next year every year on March

100
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,319
21st the cpra will be suspended for one

101
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,180
day only

102
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,220
to learn more about this unusual Clause

103
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,260
I sent my colleague Alex Stamos on

104
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,940
assignment to the palatial Bay Area home

105
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,280
of Aleister McTaggart the wealthy Real

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,260
Estate Mogul who masterminded the cpra

107
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,319
and the CCPA before it when Alex asked

108
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,819
him to explain the cpras when the

109
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,440
suspension McTaggart said I just wanted

110
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,080
to make the purge a real thing

111
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,060
he then added just like the most

112
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,220
dangerous game when Alex asked what he

113
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,260
meant by that McTaggart said quote I'll

114
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,180
give you five minutes before I unleash

115
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,159
the hounds

116
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,799
good luck Alex you got this

117
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,959
I'm gonna miss that guy

118
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,720
in sports news let's face it there are

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,459
too many cyber Cooks in the federal

120
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,560
government Kitchen in terms of ownership

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,540
of cyber issues there are numerous high

122
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,280
ranking officials from multiple agencies

123
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,080
that all have a cyber portfolio which

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,300
has prompted power struggles within the

125
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,460
executive branch and confusion among the

126
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,840
general public

127
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
now Congress has taken action to

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,040
decisively consolidate federal or cyber

129
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,320
responsibility into one position once

130
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,479
and for all this year's National Defense

131
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,639
authorization act requires all the

132
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,680
various cyber czars to arm wrestle for

133
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,880
it

134
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,320
so this is going to be a knock down drag

135
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,060
out slugfest and I'm so excited that I

136
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,500
made a bracket all right let's go over

137
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,440
this so we have Secretary mayorgas of

138
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,960
the DHS pitched against General nakasone

139

140
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
cybercom he's an army guy I think he

141
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560

144
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,620
Council again like Jenny Sawyer's in the

145
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,940
Army I didn't even realize that before

146
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,979

00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,639
um anyway thank you internet Society

171
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,960
that's helpful

172
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,479
um it's not even

173
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,340
um so then advancing I think again

174
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,039
Cesar's good Paul to Haynes uh and

175
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,380
likewise easterly versus nakistan a

176
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,639
little bit awkward since he's

177
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,259
technically at higher rank than she is

178
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,660
in the Army nevertheless as of everybody

179
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,220
on here there are seven people whose

180
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,600
pictures in front of an American flag

181
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,220
and only one who's posing a t-shirt

182
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,199
holding a Rubik's Cube I'm going

183
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,180
easterly all the way all the way to the

184
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,880
final easterly in charge of everything

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,400
cyber in the federal government and see

186
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,900
me afterwards by the bedding pool I'll

187
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,060
put a hundred bucks on her

188
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,759
all right and that is sports

189
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,660
um

190
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,240
so

191
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,060
if I could just like get my own stuff to

192
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,979
it okay all right here we go

193
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,840
turning now the international news it

194
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,180
has been 11 months since Russia invaded

195
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,759
Ukraine the conflict has largely made

196
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,740
Russia Pariah on the world stage well

197
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,960
Ukraine has emerged as a scrappy David

198
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,240
that's largely held its own against a

199
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,000
surprisingly inept Goliath so for

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,740
analysis of the latest developments in

201
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,020
the war we turn now to our International

202
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,180

look well you must be given that you

212
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,919
were recently granted Russian

213
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,240
citizenship isn't that right

214
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,479
okay so does that mean that you're now

215
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,400
eligible to be drafted and sent to fight

216
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
in Ukraine

217
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,419
oh no I'm too old for the draft besides

218
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:43,800
I have other skills that make me far

219
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,060
more valuable to corruption government

220
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,940
than I'd be as a Frontline fighter I bet

221
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,340
you do so but tell me Ed how can your

222
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,500
adoptive country be confident that you

223
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,000
won't quit that job the same way that

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,380
you quit your job working as a

225
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,120
contractor for our government

226
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,740
oh they can be very confident Rihanna

227
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,180
because they know an important fact

228
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,400
about me oh yeah what's that

229
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,919
I have a severe plutonium allergy

230
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,860
a severe allergy plutonium well that

231
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,539
does sound like a very effective

232
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,460
motivational tool thank you Edward

233
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,340
Snowden ever snowing everybody all right

234
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
all right well it wouldn't be 2023 if we

235
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,539
didn't abuse sophisticated AI for cheap

236
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,000
kicks so next up are some news items

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,199
written by chatgpt

238
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,460
the government just announced that it

239
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,840
will be banning the use of all

240
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,880
encryption in other news the government

241
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,500
just announced that we'll be banning the

242
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,580
use of all locks

243
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,479
a new study found that the average

244
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,120
person has over 200 online accounts but

245
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,580
only uses five different passwords in

246
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,260
other news the average person has also

247
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,000
just made it exponentially easier for

248
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,620
hackers to take over their entire

249
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,180
Digital Life

250
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,180
not wrong the FCC just voted to repeal

251
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,040
net neutrality of the regulations on the

252
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,360
bright side at least now we'll all know

253
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,160
exactly how much it'll cost to stream

254
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,720
our favorite cat videos in high

255
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,800
definition

256
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,260
okay the government is considering

257
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,120
revoking section 230 the law that

258
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,620
protects social media companies from

259
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,060
being held liable for their users

260
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,800
content in other words if you thought

261
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
the Facebook algorithm was bad at

262
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,800
censoring your post before just wait

263
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,420
until it has to worry about getting sued

264
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,459
for every single one

265
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,839
all right well some of those weren't

266
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,459
half bad but I think the incredibly

267
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,800
lucrative career path of stand-up comedy

268
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,140
is safe from having their jobs taken by

269
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,640
the robots just yet

270
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,120
all right and so uh speaking of

271
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,399
different breaches LastPass the computer

272
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,640
password manager was recently hacked

273
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,720
controversially the announcement of this

274
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,519
hack initially came in August of last

275
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,839
year but the company waited until

276
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,660
December 22nd to tell everybody that

277
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,100
their entire password vaults had been

278
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,860
stolen so LastPass is one two punch of

279
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,720
breaching user trust with a major hack

280
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,760
then adding insult to injury with its

281
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,620
botched communication strategy brings us

282
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,959
to a segment we call really

283
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,660
and now it's time for really with

284
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,640
Brianna feverkorn

285
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,800
really last pass

286
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,839
if you ever heard of the phrase you only

287
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,080
had one

288
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,140
job like the the robot from Rick and

289
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,480
Morty that passes butter has more jobs

290
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,839

291
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:16,680
yeah

292
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,660
Timber

293
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,640
October to investigate before announcing

294
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,380
that everybody's password vaults were

295
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,140
stolen really and then waiting to make

296
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,880
that announcement until like three days

297
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,860
before Christmas right before Christmas

298
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,500

you had a lot of accounts password

303
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,580
iterations configured too

304
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,500

for houses it's true for the federal

310
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,920
debt ceiling and it is definitely true

311
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,740
of password iterations in a goddamn

312
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,880
password

313
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,440
