00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,580
Defender metamorphizing security

3
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,619
decision making by incorporating

4
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,500
opportunity cost

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,060
cyber security is a business of

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,400
decisions about balancing costs that

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,740
influence defensive outcomes where do we

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,500
focus resources what threats pose the

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,660
most critical impact what mitigations

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,260
must be deployed before another

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,300
in cyber security decision making today

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,219
we may determine the value of a

13
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,200
particular choice but we often ignore

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,539
what might have been

15
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,820
when we expend resources on X we

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,379
inherently can't spend those same

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,780
resources on why

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,000
so we are very hungry Defenders

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,800
hopefully you all know The Very Hungry

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Caterpillar we're like that caterpillar

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,879
we want to spend our you know money time

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,799
and cognitive effort our attention on

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,680
outmaneuvering attackers but alas the

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,900
world only offers us finite scarce

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,100
resources

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,720
and in this reality we miss

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,119
opportunities and better outcomes when

28
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,159
we fail to consider alternative options

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,740
when making decisions

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,600
this is the very definition of

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,119
opportunity cost the Lost of potential

32
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,920
gain from other Alternatives when one

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,560
alternative is chosen the money spent on

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,600
data backups can't also be used for

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,220
endpoint detection to defend against

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,740
duransomware other Alternatives by

37
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,740
necessity are not pursued

38
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,360
this leads us to the critical question

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,880
we'll be exploring here today how can we

40
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,759
apply opportunity cost considering what

41
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,680
might have been demetomorphize our

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,960
defensive strategy and improve our

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,000
security outcomes

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,159
to start will introduce the concept of

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,560
opportunity cost then we'll explore the

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,420
spectrum of costs because it's not just

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,939
about money and finally we'll explore

48
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,619
how this applies to a particular problem

49
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,680
area application security

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,659
so let's start our delving into this

51
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,300
with opportunity cost

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,340
first coined by Frederick Von viser

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,140
opportunity costs is the loss of

54
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,940
potential gain from other Alternatives

55
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,239
when one alternative is chosen in cyber

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,160
security decision making today we often

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,980
fail to consider those alternatives

58
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,959
time pressure tunnel vision and

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,760
information biased a rail critical

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,680
thinking during crisis and our

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,720
exploration of alternative suffers

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
humans rarely think about opportunity

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,980
costs even the midst of calm collected

64
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,599
situations which I think for the most

65
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,060
part security is not one of those

66
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,920
the opportunity cost is actually a

67
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,840
problem or is a concept that applies

68
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,180
across problem domains and even everyday

69
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,140
life

70
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,239
so I think we should extract all those

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,220
lessons learned from these other domains

72
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,700
to improve cyber security

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,500
imagine if opportunity cost was

74
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,420
considered in every cyber security

75
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,000
decision after all real life rarely

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
matches you know the hot takes on

77
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,379
Twitter and the infosec folk wisdom and

78
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,720
cyber security theory in textbooks to

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,360
consider a few common decisions

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,280
should we buy a commercial solution or

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,140
should we expend time and effort on

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,000
building our own

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,860
do we need expensive software at all or

84
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,180
should that money be invested in

85
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,800
preparation on things like chaos

86
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,040
engineering and automated recovery

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,959
should we create new procedures or

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,760
should we ensure that the existing ones

89
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,980
are standardized and well documented so

90
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,500
teams can better self-serve

91
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,379
even consider a simple example if

92
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,780
resources are spent defending against

93
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,459
supply chain attacks which are so hot

94
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,680
right now but it's social engineering

95
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,299
that actually results in the most impact

96
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,459
to the business and the most frequent

97
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,220
losses than the business suffers

98
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,599
allocating resources to security can

99
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,879
even be detrimental to the bottom line

100
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,599
which imposes quite the cost

101
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,459
incorporating opportunity costs and

102
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,500
cyber security decision making helps us

103
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,360
minimize the impact of external threats

104
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
maximize company productivity and in

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,120
general helps us more optimally achieve

106
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,640
our goals

107
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,439
the cost of our choices that were not

108
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,879
just money and they're not just first

109
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:14,159
order effects how do these variegated

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,199
costs manifest in practice how do we

111
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,060
calculate the expected outcome of a

112
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,978
choice such questions are relevant to

113
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,320
nearly every decision cyber security or

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,880
otherwise

115
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,139
for instance what's the value of

116
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,060
spending two hours on reading a new book

117
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,100
is that more or less than the value you

118
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,900
would get from practicing the violin for

119
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,580
two hours or whatever your hobby of

120
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,259
choice is

121
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,880
these actually aren't impossible

122
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,220
questions to answer even if they feel a

123
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,320
little unnatural to us we can actually

124
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
answer these questions even if we don't

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,699
have precise absolute dollar values for

126
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,560
these activities

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,500
we can metamorphose our our decision

128
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,240
making for the better by simply

129
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,620
prompting ourselves to think about

130
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,020
Alternatives at all to make those

131
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,699
alternative salients we need to think

132
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,440
about the spectrum of costs that are

133
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,979
present in our cyber security decisions

134
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,840
this brings us to the costs and effects

135
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,820
in infosec

136
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,100
so the bigger picture question is how do

137
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,320
we elucidate the bigger picture of the

138
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,580
decision

139
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,380
mapping out the potential costs and

140
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,759
effects of security Investments

141
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,680
including of not implementing those

142
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,660
Investments can elucidate this bigger

143
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,000
picture of the decision at hand

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,500
no one's reading this slide right now

145
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,960
please don't try uh it's impossible this

146
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,940
is very much a leave behind for for the

147
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,039
world uh covering covering the numerous

148
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,380
costs and effects and security but

149
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,880
mostly what we see today is on the left

150
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,460
side in costs and the red but if we

151
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,740
consider opportunity costs perhaps we

152
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,300
can start producing more of the positive

153
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,460
effects on the right as well

154
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,500
so what are some of these first there

155
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,120
are tangible costs the ones with direct

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,340
monetary expenditure I think wages

157
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,800
Hardware overhead Outsourcing and so

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,240
forth

159
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,520
they're also intangible costs like

160
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,259
employees investing time and security

161
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,660
interventions the cognitive overhead of

162
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,820
task squishing interruptions to flow

163
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,680
that you know precious resource for

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
developers and even increased conflicts

165
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
at the organization level they can also

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,639
experience delayed time to Market due to

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,740
security interventions like slower

168
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,660
software release cycles and that can

169
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,940
erode their competitive advantage

170
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,440
then from a societal perspective

171
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,360
thinking really big when we thrust

172
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,340
security responsibilities onto consumers

173
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,240
we increase their anxiety

174
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,039
and on the effects side productivity

175
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,900
effects are numerous I recommend reading

176
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,460
Dr forsgren's space of developer

177
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,740
productivity which was an acmq for more

178
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,259
here but highly relevant ones for our

179
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,479
discussion today at the employee level

180
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,419
are usually perception of work efficacy

181
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,699
reduced burnout improved collaboration

182
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,580
and reduced toil and so much more

183
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,620
organization productivity effects can

184
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,660
include product quality gains it can

185
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,360
include faster time to Market incident

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,220
reduction speed of change Integrations

187
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,740
and also a lot more

188
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,440
then there are tangible benefits those

189
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,120
are also monetary like Revenue growth

190
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,819
customer renewals more software releases

191
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,039
profitability and uptime

192
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,440
despite being so tangible uh security

193
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,419
teams often don't consider the erosion

194
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,039
of these as part of the cost when

195
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,720
they're thinking about the return of

196
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,539
their security Investments

197
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,520
they're also intangible benefits like

198
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,319
emotional experiences which we'll talk

199
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,620
about in a bit like reducing anxiety we

200
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,300
also want employees who are energized

201
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,400
not drained and who are dedicated not

202
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,919
cynical organizations also care a lot

203
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,660
about competitive advantage and things

204
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,479
like brand perception

205
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,520
then finally there are tangible savings

206
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,560
and that helps with profitability like

207
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,020
reduced head count

208
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,060
reduced Tech cost savings things like

209
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,919
lower compliance fines

210
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,479
but how often do we think about how to

211
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,699
reduce what we spend on security and

212
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,740
find Opportunities to consolidate across

213
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,180
security and software engineering

214
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,919
infrastructure engineering or site

215
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,220
reliability engineering

216
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,840
how do we start understanding the

217
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,580
outcomes of a security decision like

218
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,319
purchasing a solution through this lens

219
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,720
of costs and effects can be especially

220
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
helpful to consider something we call

221
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,800
the null Baseline especially with an eye

222
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,360
to the benefits on that right side of

223
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,699
the graphic the null Baseline in a

224
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,800
nutshell is basically what do you gain

225
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,699
by not implementing a security solution

226
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,379
would developers be more productive

227
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,979
would employees be less stressed

228
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,660
it's important to stay honest about what

229
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,940
is lost when we Implement security which

230
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,039
can also elucidate a broader set of

231
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,139
options that might still uphold benefits

232
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,419
like software velocity that would

233
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,159
otherwise remain unexplored when we make

234
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,240
a decision

235
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,940
we cannot just think about ourselves as

236
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,039
stakeholders

237
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,779
this is precisely why negative

238
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,580
externalities are relevant in cyber

239
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,860
security decision making we are very

240
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,120
hungry Defenders like these little

241
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,980
caterpillars gobbling up leaves if

242
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,120
you've ever had a garden you know they

243
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,640
can be a total Scourge we may devour the

244
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,899
leaves of productivity for our

245
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,339
organizations in the pursuit of

246
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,920
protection and we might cause more harm

247
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,500
than good

248
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,420
what are externalities they are the

249
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,339
costs and benefits imposed on other

250
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,100
entities by a choice in cyber security

251
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,500
decision making as elsewhere the

252
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,480
monetary costs and monetary benefits of

253
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,940
a particular choice are often considered

254
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,700
in isolation rather than considering its

255
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,800
externalities

256
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,360
a classic example of a negative

257
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,820
externality is pollution a firm can

258
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,740
perform cost-benefit analysis to

259
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,839
consider the cost incurred by producing

260
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,339
a widget they can think about the

261
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,260
benefits that they get from selling the

262
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,140
widget but it won't consider the costs

263
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,760
imposed on the local community by

264
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,500
lowering the quality of drinking water

265
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,380
nor on the costs imposed to society by

266
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,320
increased carbon emissions

267
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,080
in cyber security the implementation of

268
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,300
say an application security tool may

269
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,040
have a positive return for the security

270
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,300
team

271
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,980
but it might result in a negative

272
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,220
externality of slower or fewer software

273
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,560
releases which impacts the organization

274
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,200
the organization's teams and even its

275
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,480
customers

276
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,700
we should always consider what costs we

277
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,920
are imposing elsewhere especially in the

278
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,600
realm of those intangible costs like

279
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
burnout conflict disruption of flow

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,420
productivity loss and so forth

281
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,040
some domains like healthcare actually

282
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,100
refer to the true cost of a choice as

283
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,519
the shadow price the shadow price

284
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,720
reflects the prices of goods services

285
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
and resources that are proportional to

286
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,380
the true opportunity cost for the

287
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,240
economy taking account of any

288
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,399
externalities

289
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,680
similar to healthcare cyber security is

290
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,720
complex in its network of stakeholders

291
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,580
the benefits and costs from the

292
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,260
perspective of a security team the

293
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,360
organization the teams within it the

294
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,220
organization's users and customers and

295
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,959
the society around them all those

296
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,579
perspectives are likely to be quite

297
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,860
different so benefits for one

298
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,240
stakeholder May beget a cost for another

299
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,860
a worthy question to bring back to your

300
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,140
work or research is what is the shadow

301
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,899
price of each security mitigation in

302
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,779
your organization

303
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,459
when we're thinking about costs and

304
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,560
Shadow prices we need to think Beyond

305
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,240
money

306
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,519
the root cost is often narrowly

307
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,339
considered in terms of monetary cost or

308
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,660
monetary value

309
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,220
certainly one important aspect when

310
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,839
we're making decisions because Financial

311
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,420
Resources spent on one opportunity means

312
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,040
that those resources can't be spent now

313
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,140
or later on something else that money is

314
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,740
spent but what else must we consider

315
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,019
time is a very common consideration and

316
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,300
opportunity cost but is often neglected

317
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,500
in practice

318
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,240
and security Investments can be

319
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,700
especially profligate with time

320
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,560
for instance time is required to answer

321
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,019
help desk calls it also takes time to

322
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:45,480
develop new security policies and it

323
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,800
definitely takes developers a lot of

324
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,660
time to fix those you know thousand list

325
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,760
of critical or super urgent

326
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,339
vulnerabilities right

327
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,320
cognition is another resource we have to

328
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,420
consider so cognitive resources such as

329
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,519
attention affect and productivity are

330
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,500
relevant in any domains when humans

331
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,800
expend cognitive effort to solve some

332
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,779
sort of problem

333
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,820
emotion is actually another resource we

334
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,920
should consider we often Overlook it so

335
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,300
emotional experience like anxiety

336
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,579
frustration and confusion is often

337
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:15,899
overlooked as a cost when we're

338
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,940
evaluating options despite its

339
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,740
well-documented salience during human

340
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,899
decision making

341
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,640
in cyber security studies actually show

342
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,440
that the stress of time pressure can

343
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,959
exacerbate users frustrations with the

344
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,060
very poor usability of a security tool

345
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,100
which makes them more likely to bypass

346
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,420
that tool or the security requirement

347
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,800
consider the example of securing the

348
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,420
software supply chain everybody's

349
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,459
favorite Boogeyman right now so business

350
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,779
is thinking about moving from an

351
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:43,920
Internet connected development

352
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,320
environment to a standalone disconnected

353
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
development environment to Shield it

354
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,040
from external threats

355
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,899
what are the costs of moving to this

356
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,180
disconnected development environment the

357
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,680
example might seem ridiculous it has

358
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,180
been proposed officially within the past

359
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,519
year so there are direct costs to this

360
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,100
change such as perhaps the need for new

361
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,220
hardware or increased I.T support but

362
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,260
even more substantial are the costs to

363
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,160
productivity and employee satisfaction

364
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,019
developers can't smoothly query the

365
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,459
internet you know copy and paste from

366
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:15,839
stack Overflow because that's what

367
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,360
developers do new Time Investments will

368
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,800
be required because of the network

369
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,440
disconnect and productivity will go down

370
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,839
as a result

371
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,480
so many variables influence cost and the

372
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,399
principle of opportunity costs invites

373
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,800
organizations to consider how else costs

374
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
might be used and which option maximizes

375
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,800
their success

376
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,480
think about opportunity cost in terms of

377
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,700
the laws of thermodynamics can actually

378
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,639
be an Illuminating analogy

379
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,899
so it's well understood that energy

380
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,760
within a system including a system made

381
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,100
up of other systems can't be created or

382
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,500
destroyed however energy with assist

383
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,660
within a system can be interchangeable

384
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,300
like a human hand winding expanding

385
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,579
energy to wind a clock which transfers

386
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,320
energy into its spring and then it

387
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,899
catalyzes the motion

388
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,300
Security Programs are a component of

389
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,700
organizations and they can expend energy

390
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,160
or absorb it

391
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,200
for instance a requirement for

392
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,060
organizational users to be vigilant to

393
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,220
phishing threats requires them to expend

394
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,139
energy on solving a security program

395
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,360
which the security team can absorb

396
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,519
because these user efforts allow the

397
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,880
security team to expend energy elsewhere

398
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,740
requiring software Engineers to triage

399
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,360
bugs discovered by vulnerability

400
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,060
scanners is another example developers

401
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,740
expend energy combing through the

402
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,360
findings and fixing them and the

403
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,220
security team can absorb that energy

404
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,740
thinking of where energy is expended and

405
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,019
absorbed and by whom can help excavate

406
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,060
opportunity costs in any sort of cyber

407
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,899
security decision

408
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,980
this brings us to our case study in

409
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,779
application security starting with the

410
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,320
challenge of the focal point

411
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
an opportunity cost framing exposes

412
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,980
situations when the problem definition

413
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,680
is overly prescriptive which dismisses

414
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,720
Alternatives that might be superior in

415
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,060
solving the problem this zoomed in

416
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,740
perspective that I'm describing is

417
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,139
called the focal point

418
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,000
for instance what static application

419
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,519
security tool is best SAS tool that but

420
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
gets a very narrow focal point because

421
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,199
it only prescribes SAS tools it's worth

422
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,320
asking why we want sast at all

423
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,940
the answer likely leads to the question

424
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,100
okay how can we minimize the number of

425
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,620
security bugs developers introduce into

426
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,260
code this is a little better it's less

427
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,060
tool specific and it might introduce the

428
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,519
focal option of say security awareness

429
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,860
training for developers nevertheless it

430
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,899
is still anchored to a relatively narrow

431
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,899
focal point we can ask why do we want to

432
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,459
minimize the number of bugs that

433
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,440
developers introduce into code

434
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,540
the answer is likely because we don't

435
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,339
want them to be exploited in production

436
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,220
and cause problems

437
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,199
with this better understanding of why we

438
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,120
can form an even better question which

439
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,220
is how do we minimize the impact of

440
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,440
security bugs in code running in

441
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,839
production this question allows a much

442
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,339
more expansive list of potential

443
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,139
opportunities and potential Solutions

444
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,300
which helps us consider a variety of

445
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,160
Alternatives from a more zoomed out

446
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,380
focal point

447
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,120
this allows us to allocate our finite

448
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,459
pool of resources to a variety of

449
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,199
alternatives

450
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:23,940
for instance if we brainstorm with other

451
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,800
teams we can maybe think of a broader

452
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,660
list potential Solutions and best

453
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,279
prioritize how we allocate our Capital

454
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,680
this broader list could include SAS

455
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
tools and developer training but also

456
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,240
ephemeral or immutable infrastructure or

457
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,220
standardizing libraries and patterns so

458
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,660
developers are less likely to make

459
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,940
mistakes it could include architecting

460
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,500
the system with strong isolation

461
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,959
properties talked about that on Tuesday

462
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,519
or you could run security chaos

463
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,440
experiments to uncover how the system

464
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,300
behaves when it encounters some sort of

465
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,339
adverse condition like an attacker

466
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,019
exploiting a bug

467
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,820
the point is we can allocate our finite

468
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,100
pool of resources to one alternative or

469
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,019
another we invest in standardized

470
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,880
libraries and patterns then we can't

471
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,859
invest those same exact resources in

472
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,380
those SAS tools perhaps we solve the

473
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,500
problem even better this way

474
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,240
the focal point is about the true

475
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,859
outcome we seek in our decision problem

476
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,480
so it's not about generalized or

477
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,579
specialized tools it's very much that we

478
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,780
need to understand the real Target

479
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,359
benefit digging into a few layers of why

480
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,240
if we want to investigate what benefits

481
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,939
we are giving up by doing X instead of Y

482
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,980
to approximate opportunity cost

483
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
unfortunately our default tendency as

484
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,640
humans is to remain very zoomed in on a

485
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,400
problem so for instance consumers will

486
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,260
consider which Resort is best for my

487
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,120
vacation rather than thinking about the

488
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,679
true Target benefit which might be to

489
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,900
reduce stress or maybe generate a sense

490
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,360
of wonder and that would expand the

491
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,460
possible set of options to Beyond just a

492
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,980
resort for a vacation

493
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,960
to find the true Target benefit we have

494
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,880
to consider our organization's kind of

495
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,500
fundamental purpose

496
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,419
most businesses do have a defined

497
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,340
purpose to fulfill and their primary

498
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,840
organizational missions are not to

499
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,820
secure their endpoints or their networks

500
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,559
otherwise they would probably go out of

501
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,340
business

502
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,080
so through this lens any work that

503
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,340
doesn't directly support the

504
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,039
organization's fundamental purpose Bears

505
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,780
the opportunity cost of taking time

506
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,900
cognition attention budget away from

507
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,059
work that more directly fulfills that

508
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,799
purpose

509
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,600
so for retail Corporation wants a

510
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,240
resilient online store let's say for you

511
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,039
know their e-commerce application

512
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,660
they likely don't have the internal

513
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,080
skill set or the expertise needed that's

514
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,140
expertise think like databases ad

515
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,059
delivery ad placement and content

516
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,919
delivery as well

517
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,720
but instead they could Outsource the

518
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,640
problem to some sort of platform service

519
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,100
provider an ad Tech firm or a Content

520
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,140
delivery Network whose employees are

521
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,179
skilled at such tasks because it's part

522
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,520
of their organizational Mission like in

523
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
this picture the hummingbird wants

524
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,539
sustins from nectar but an outsourced

525
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,260
provider of it will do just fine

526
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,820
the opportunity cost of trying to

527
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,440
successfully create and operate that

528
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,539
online store is time and cognitive

529
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,220
effort that could have been better spent

530
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,280
dedicated to the retail business logic

531
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,900
that would deliver more value to

532
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,919
customers

533
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,900
and this is a considerable cost to pay

534
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,240
but it's a cost that organizations all

535
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,200
over the world pay every day

536
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,720
so let's summarize

537
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,700
opportunity costs can be considered in

538
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,919
every cyber security decision because it

539
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,840
is always relevant whether we are aware

540
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,240
of it or not

541
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,100
we incorporate opportunity costs we're

542
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,720
more likely to derive the best security

543
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,700
outcomes we can balance our

544
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,559
organization's multifaceted goals

545
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
nurturing business operations that are

546
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,340
resilient to attacks and other adverse

547
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,380
scenarios

548
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,539
cyber security decision makers would

549
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,460
really benefit from recognizing the many

550
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,440
types of costs Beyond just money

551
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,280
and we think opportunity costs can be

552
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,900
understood by anyone given the right

553
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,179
introduction and Framing and one way to

554
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,919
ease into the consideration of

555
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,020
opportunity cost is to consider that

556
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,660
null Baseline heuristic to consider the

557
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,580
option of doing nothing rather than the

558
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,400
choice at hand this can only elucidate

559
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,080
the true problem to that true Target

560
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,120
benefit the one that really needs

561
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,340
solving

562
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,140
through the lens of the spectrum of

563
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,460
costs and effects especially when

564
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,140
considering the option of not

565
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,580
implementing a security measure

566
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,679
incorporating opportunity costs can

567
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,780
become natural and accessible in our

568
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,640
decision making

569
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,260
so The Parting question for you all

570
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,360
today is I'm very excited to see because

571
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,039
there are many Brilliant Minds in here

572
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,140
is how can we nurture the widespread

573
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,120
inclusion of opportunity cost in

574
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,860
research and practice so we can

575
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,840
metamorphize our security decision

576
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,360
making for the better

577
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,539
if you enjoyed that swathi said book is

578
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,980
available for pre-order should be out

579
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,080
this spring very exciting with that

580
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,400
thank you very much for your time and

581
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,080
attention which as we discussed is

582
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,159
finite and precious
