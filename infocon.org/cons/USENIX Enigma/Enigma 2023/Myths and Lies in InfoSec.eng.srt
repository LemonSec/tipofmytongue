1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,260
if you're watching this video no it

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,420
doesn't mean I'm dead just means I'm

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,699
still coming up positive on my covet

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,600
tests

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,439
I hope you enjoy my talk lies and myths

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,000
in infosec

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,479
here we go

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,540
so why are myths and lies even a thing

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,860
infosec is challenging enough

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,800
we're in a huge growing industry sure

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,079
it's still a young industry but uh

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,899
growing lots of money in it if you have

14
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,640
any kind of cyber security experience

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,340
you're guaranteed a job for for life as

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,160
far as I can tell

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,320
VCS private Equity firms pouring tons of

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,719
money into it and in general in the last

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,000
couple decades we got the budget we

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,359
asked for we got the people we asked for

21
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,400
so why would we make up myths and lies

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
why would that even be a thing

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,700
so that's what we're going to explore

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,100
today

25
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,600
and dive into a little bit deeper

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,360
yep damages and losses are huge why

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,479
pretend that things are even worse and

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,420
one of those things is Comfort which

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,900
might sound like a weird way to say that

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,880
but because a lot of people in this

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,840
industry are very Mission oriented

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,180
they tend to latch on to things that fit

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,180
that narrative that make them feel proud

34
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,780
of doing what they do in cyber security

35
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,939
and uh you know things they would want

36
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,540
to share and so a lot of myths take that

37
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,840
form and then the more nefarious lies

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,920
maybe prey on that

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,439
another reason definitely more nefarious

40
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,960
is the fake it till you make it you know

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,200
we live in a culture now where this is

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,939
entertainment even you know docudrama

43
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,899
series on uh theranos and on wework uh

44
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,760
I've been popping out left and right

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,520
fire Festival I think there were two

46
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,980
docudramas on those that came out at the

47
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,480
same time on different streaming

48
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,020
networks and you know this is just part

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,200
of startup culture uh that's almost a

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,940
joke at this point but it's it's a very

51
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,599
real thing and a lot of cyber security

52
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,020
companies are startups there's over uh I

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,420
think 3 000 cyber security companies

54
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,400
I've seen from people who track lists of

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,420
those things

56
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,239
and uh and a lot of them just want to

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,280
meet those investor goals you know they

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,860
want to land that next customer and some

59
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,540
of these myths and lies help them to do

60
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,640
that

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
and finally reason three

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,760
proving uh you know some of these myths

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,879
and lies uh doing the due diligence due

64
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,640
diligence on them can be very difficult

65
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,500
and I think nutrition is an interesting

66
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,140
uh industry that we can draw parallels

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,519
to where

68
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,099
sure I feel great after drinking that

69
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,220
shake uh just after I wake up but is

70
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,739
that because I got two two more hours of

71
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,420
sleep last night or is it because I

72
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,099
drink the shake it's really hard to

73
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,840
separate the two out at least for an

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,260
individual

75
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,019
so see if you can spot a pattern as we

76
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,620
go through the talk here today this one

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,560
I've got Cloud9 card systems and blue

78
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,920
security

79
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,000
confirmation bias is probably the better

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,819
way to say Comfort when I was talking

81
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,220
about uh you know things that fit the

82
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,580
narrative before and it's it's a very

83
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,980
dangerous one because again being very

84
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,840
Mission oriented if we don't prepare

85
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,019
ourselves to do that due diligence to

86
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,780
check on stats you know to think twice

87
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
about the things that people are telling

88
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,280
us we can be very vulnerable and

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,819
susceptible to confirmation bias into

90
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,220
accepting and repeating those lies and

91
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,299
myths and I think the way that

92
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:17,760
yourbias.is puts it here is very useful

93
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,160
think of your ideas and beliefs as

94
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,139
software you're actively trying to find

95
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,360
problems with rather than things to be

96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,840
defended and it's a very unnatural uh

97
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,340
way to do that we tend to get very

98
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,440
defensive very emotional about our our

99
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,419
beliefs and

100
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,680
it's just dangerous when myths and lies

101
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,320
come to form some of those beliefs and

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,400
uh

103
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,919
that's a healthier way of looking at it

104
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,340
I think

105
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,419
uh sunk cost fallacy I think is behind

106
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,460
uh some of the reason that we see myths

107
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,800
turn into lies so I think starting out

108
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,540
uh there are a lot of myths that are

109
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,840
um unintentional that are accidental you

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,940
know perhaps somebody just says it and

111
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,580
it catches on or somebody misinterprets

112
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,800
a stat or a graph and at some point the

113
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,380
people using this information find out

114
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,800
that it's a myth it's debunked sometimes

115
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,759
directly to them and at that moment when

116
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,039
they decide whether or not they're going

117
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,919
to continue using that bad stat I think

118
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,820
that's where it becomes the myth the

119
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,620
myth becomes lie

120
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,020
and uh I I would like to think that at

121
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,660
least in some of these cases uh you know

122
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,580
these companies aren't entirely frauds

123
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,199
from the beginning like theranos for

124
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,160
example you know I've I've dived deeply

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,740
into that story and I I would like to

126
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,320
think at some point that she really did

127
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,660
want to innovate really did want to

128
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,720
change the world but at that point where

129
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,240
experts said no this can't be done or at

130
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,880
least it can't be done uh in the near

131
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,380
future

132
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,840
you know I I think uh

133
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
you know there's that sunk cost that

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
we've already raised so much investment

135
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,139
I've already promised so many people

136
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,360
that we can do this you know some

137
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,000
people's egos don't allow them to turn

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,639
around and go back or to say sorry we

139
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,680
can't do it and return the investors

140
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
money

141
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,380
and of course lies travel much faster

142
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,080
than the truth uh because it takes time

143
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,780
to do due diligence and to discover the

144
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,020
truth

Federal distribute.it digit notar at

147
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,280
this point some folks should definitely

148
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,020
start seeing a pattern

149
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,020
and let's take one of these bad stats

150
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,500
cyber crime costs 2.9 billion dollars

151
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,100
per minute

152
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,300
just let that let that sit let that

153
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,340
marinate in your brain especially those

154
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,740
of you with

155
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,360
statistics or who have

156
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,520
taken classes and statistics or have

157
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,840
math or

158

Science degrees

159
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,380
2.9 billion dollars per minute

160
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,419
okay so sure you know maybe they meant

161
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,300
to say million and they said billion but

162
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,759
this you know once this tweet is up for

163
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,419
half a day for 24 hours it can do a lot

164
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,660
of damage it can spread quite a bit to

165
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,880
their credit they pulled it down but

166
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,039
in a lot of cases that damage is already

167
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,520
done it's amazing how long myths and

168
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,199
lies can live given just a few hours of

169
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,759
life before corrected

170
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,520
so why challenge infosec myths and lies

171
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,280
there are a few practical reasons one of

172
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,860
them is credibility for our industry as

173
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,620
a whole like I mentioned before we're

174
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,840
still a very young industry you know so

175
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,360
we want to make sure that we maintain

176
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,520
this credibility you know we've got a

177
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,060
lot of attention from media we're not

178
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,240
professionalized we do manage a lot of

179
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,819
people in budget inside of a lot of

180
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,099
companies now so credibility is

181
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,080
something to protect you know our

182
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,180
reputation is something to protect

183
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,760
uh also some of these myths and lies can

184
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
misdirect uh our efforts to solve some

185
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,760
problems you know uh especially if if

186
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,760
these are being repeated by vendors by

187
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,039
thought leaders people who are trusted

188
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,800
within the industry uh a lot of damage

189
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,200
can be done in terms of you know

190
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,560
problems not getting solved because

191
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,580
resources are pointed in the wrong

192
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,380
direction

193
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,380
and finally you know I I think the truth

194
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,860
is worth tracking down because we often

195
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,899
get more than just the truth when we do

196
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,800
that we learn more along the way and

197
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,560
um and it's it's almost always more

198
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,839
interesting uh than the myth or the LIE

199
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,000
only honest code spaces you should

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,500
definitely see where this is going by

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,680
now

202
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,180
so there's one company behind most of

203
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,339
the fake stats in infosec this was

204
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,019
something I was fairly shocked to learn

205
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,940
and

206
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,920
um you might recognize some of their

207
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,580
stats one of them is the infamous uh

208
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,519
trillions of dollars uh in cyber crime

209
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,660
damages every year uh 10.5 trillion is

210
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,660
now the estimate for 2025 6 trillion was

211
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,200
the estimate in 2021 and if you're like

212
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
me I mean these are staggering numbers I

213
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,620
don't use these numbers at this scale on

214
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,860
a regular basis so I need context

215
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,080
you know I'm thinking what's Germany's

216
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,140
GDP is it is it less than 6 trillion is

217
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,720
it more than 6 trillion uh how much in

218
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,060
Ransom payments were paid last year how

219
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,000
much is global fraud every year

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,300
and um and the answer to those to those

221
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,300
questions does kind of help uh Germany's

222
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,720
GDP is indeed less than six trillion and

223
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,540
Global fraud numbers are less than 6

224
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,279
trillion you know so already I'm

225
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,680
thinking yeah this is this does not

226
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,720
track

227
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,940
um on top of that one of the biggest

228
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,240
issues in our field right now one of the

229
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,060
biggest cyber uh certainly one of the

230
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,279
most uh

231
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,700
um in the headlines for cyber crime is

232
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,959
ransomware and ransomware never hit a

233
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,060
billion dollars before it started going

234
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,060
back down yes it went down 40 percent

235
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,240
last year ransomware payments did

236
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,820
so

237
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,640
you know for ransomware payments are a

238
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,360
fraction of a sixth of a percent of six

239
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,940
trillion dollars I have no idea where

240
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,839
that

241
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,420
the rest of that is coming in you know

242
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,880
it definitely doesn't make sense and

243
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,680
when you try to research it there's no

244
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,140
data behind it there's no methodology

245
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,320
behind it there's there's nothing behind

246
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,519
it except

247
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,860
this number stated over and over and

248
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,019
over again by this company and everyone

249
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,660
that listens to them

250
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,120
they're also behind most of the job

251
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,519
numbers that you've seen which also have

252
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,620
no data behind them I don't think these

253
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,740
are as quite as egregious

254
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,480
I don't think they're off by orders of

255
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,920
magnitude but I do think they're off

256
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,800
and also they spend a lot of time

257
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,680
touting this old 60 percent of small

258
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,779
businesses go out of business within six

259
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:58,200
months of a data breach number which is

260
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,060
a crazy stat we'll talk about a little

261
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,359
bit later

262
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,640
and there's a tried and true process

263
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,000
behind this make up a stat repeat it as

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,399
much as possible in as many places as

265
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,040
possible there are plenty of media

266
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,680
Outlets that will let you pay or just

267
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,579
let you contribute uh content to them

268
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,079
that makes you know whatever you

269
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,180
contribute look very official on those

270
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,380
domain names

271
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,640
and then once you've gotten it posted in

272
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,160
enough places

273
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,320
you can cite it as if it's real research

274
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,839
as if there's some you know real data

275
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,079
behind it when in fact it's circular

276
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,260
it's recursive and there actually is no

277
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,880
source for that data there is no

278
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,120
methodology but at first glance you see

279
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,339
a footnote it looks uh like it's been

280
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,279
properly cited until you try and track

281
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,040
it down and find it it goes nowhere

282
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,959
and there's a lot of money to be made in

283
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,300
this this this company does very well

284
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,820
and it is featured and quoted uh

285
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
everywhere government Academia

286
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,120
uh industry experts uh

287
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,180
you I and you have probably seen these

288
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,600
stats uh at least a couple times this

289
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,519
year alone in 2023.

290
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,600
and to quote James McCormick Who Sold 50

291
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,380
million dollars 50 million pounds of

292
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,200
fake bomb detectors it does exactly what

293
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,940
it's designed to it makes money

294
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,500
a few more here

295
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,720
my biz homepage precedent Communications

296
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,980
Colorado Timberline vastemol

297
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,700
so back to the 60 stat this is one of

298
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,560
the most prolific and Long Live fake

299
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,279
stats and actually inspired me to do uh

300
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,079
a bit of research some of my favorite

301
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,540
research in fact

302
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,540
and again this is a weird stat when I

303
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,040
first saw this I thought

304
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,060
you know six months within six months of

305
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,459
a breach like that's a really long time

306
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,220
like small businesses going under within

307
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,920
six months of a breach

308
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,240
they could be going under for any number

309
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,120
of a reason of reasons they could be

310
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,100
going under because they're the 11th

311
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,740
cupcake shop in the neighborhood they

312
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,600
could be going under because they just

313
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,420
didn't manage money well you know it's

314
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,240
just uh it didn't sit well so I started

315
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,420
to look into it started to try and find

316
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,940
a source for this data but where's the

317
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,940
evidence behind this data it didn't

318
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,019
exist

319
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,139
so I started researching I thought

320
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,440
how many companies do actually go under

321
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,860
because of a breach or do any at all

322
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,800
and so after five years of doing that

323
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,339
research I found 23 companies not 23

324
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,000
companies last year but 23 companies in

325
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,779
the last 20 years in all time I can only

326
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,000
find 23 companies who have gone under

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,980
because

328
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,160
as a direct effect of a cyber security

329
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,399
incident or breach and you can you can

330
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,959
find that data there it's open to the

331
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,940
public in fact hundreds of people have

332
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,279
have helped me curate it over the years

333
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,699
and have submitted possible candidates

334
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,880
for this data set and I go through I

335
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,720
investigate each one and uh and yeah

336
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,139
only only 23. so now I've got some data

337
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,380
to counter this 60 of small businesses

338
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,680
stat

339
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,540
but where did it originally come from

340
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,800
so

341
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,899
National cyber security Alliance and

342
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,440
Symantec did a a joint report and a

343
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,959
quote made it into that report they

344
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,240
published it uh for for only a couple

345
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,920
months as far as I can tell before

346
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,540
taking it down and putting up a uh

347
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,360
retraction basically saying that you

348
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
know there's no data behind that stat

349
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,839
they don't know where it came from so

350
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,320
they're taking it out of the report

351
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,060
and because it sticks around because it

352
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,720
won't go away every year or maybe every

353
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,740
other year uh they uh publish yet

354
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,839
another retraction basically saying the

355
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,839
stats incorrect don't use it we're sorry

356
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,240
in fact a journalist named Joseph marks

357
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,779
from nexgov Tracked Down The Source and

358
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,079
actually interviewed the individual that

359
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,240
this quote came from that this bad stack

360
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,579
came from and he says I don't know I

361
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,380
heard it from a cyber security expert at

362
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,300
some point yeah I don't remember who or

363
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,779
when or what any of the details

364
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,300
and so there you know we finally Tracked

365
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,459
Down The Source but then how do you kill

366
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,639
it it's still getting used in fact the

367
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,339
source who came up who originated the

368
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,160
fake stat is still using it as of two

369
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,699
months ago on his own websites so he's

370
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,619
still pushing this bad stat even though

371
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,240
he knows uh there's no truth behind it

372
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,980
um it has been interviewed to that

373
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,720
effect by by an investigative journalist

374
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,599
and this has been quoted by the SEC it

375
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,140
led to a bill passing in the small

376
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,960
business cyber Security Act uh vendors

377
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,000
are using it thought leaders use it we

378
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,960
see it everywhere still

379
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,200
and now you know what this mystery

380
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,720
timeline is this is the list of 23

381
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,520
companies who have gone out of business

382
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,360
due to a uh cyber security incident or

383
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,380
breach

384
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,200
and yes there were a lot in 2019 and yes

385
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,020
I think at least four of those were due

386
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,520
to ransomware

387
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,679
so that's the most prolific year we've

388
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,980
ever seen is six companies not the 150

389
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,020
plus you would expect to see if that

390
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,740
stat were true

391
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,320
foreign

392
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,320
motivational myths and maxims so sayings

393
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,660
maxims whatever you want to call them uh

394
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,460
there's a few of these that wrinkle me a

395
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,980
bit and and

396
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,280
they perhaps help to sell products and

397
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,880
services but I I think they need to be

398
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,539
replaced you know first of all this one

399
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,700
particularly you've probably heard a lot

400
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,559
attackers only need to get it right once

401
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:38,820
Defenders have to get it right every

402
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,600
time

403
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,539
uh first off it's it's

404
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,600
you know very demotivational second of

405
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,020
all it's not true you know maybe this is

406
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,240
true for the very first hold the

407
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,340
attacker gets into the defender's

408
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,260
environment but from that point the math

409
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,500
flips and now the defender

410
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,220
um

411
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,740
only needs to catch the attacker once

412
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,080
the attacker has to evade them every

413
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,360
single time and the saying completely

414
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,580
flips once they're on the defender's

415
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,039
Turf the defender can have deception

416
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,039
traps you know there's all kinds of uh

417
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,660
preparation they can do to catch that

418
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,380
attacker now

419
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,380
mm-hmm

420
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,679
it's not if you get hacked it's when is

421
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,960
another one here

422
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,580
um

423
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,460
this is just numerically impossible

424
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,000
there aren't enough cyber security

425
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,580
uh or cyber criminals out there to

426
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,380
attack every business or every

427
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,559
individual in fact we've seen many cases

428
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,720
where attackers have had access to

429
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,780
thousands of networks and only chose to

430
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,400
attack one or two because that's all

431
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
they had the resources for so again this

432
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,440
is just uh Incorrect and not useful uh

433
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,820
unless I guess you're trying to sell

434
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,600
products and services

435
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,059
and then humans are the weakest link in

436
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:07,860
security this is another one that

437
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,260
bothers me because humans are humans and

438
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,000
of course humans are going to do human

439
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,419
things uh to quote uh Lisa plagomire

440
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:19,080
here humans are reliably unreliable

441
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,400
so

442
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,380
I would argue the weakest link is

443
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,500
anybody designing systems without humans

444
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,900
in mind for systems to be used by humans

445
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,039
without humans in mind

446
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,419
foreign

447
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,179
things up here I have my conclusion

448
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,360
cassowary who I will call Paul Paul will

449
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,600
help me wrap things up here uh have some

450
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,299
healthy skepticism uh take a little time

451
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,780
to look up stats find data that provides

452
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,480
that context like we did around the the

453
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,240
six trillion dollar number

454
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,520
um do do a few sanity checks a lot of

455
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,140
this stuff doesn't take a whole lot of

456
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,260
effort to check on

457
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,960
and a lot of these reports that there's

458
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,000
no footnotes there's no methodology

459
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,820
listed at the bottom of the report you

460
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,799
know there are no appendices why would

461
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,360
you trust it

462
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,360
if there's no scientific rigor why why

463
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,220
would you bother why would you bother

464
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,640
with it

465
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,580
um

466
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,559
also with the maxims I think it would be

467
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,419
great if we could come up with some

468
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,460
positive versions of these some

469
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,080
motivational ones rather than

470
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,200
demotivational that would be great to

471
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,059
replace the uh these tired stereotypes

472
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,700
and

473
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
going looking for data is a bit of an

474
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,620
art but it's easier than you'd think

475
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,600
you'd be surprised how much data is out

476
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,799
there

477
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,080
um data scientists tend to be very open

478
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,780
and sharing uh there's a lot of open

479
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,020
data sets out there the Verizon dbir

480
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,840
folks have made their Veris data set

481
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,960
available on their GitHub page and are

482
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,179
also very accommodating if you have any

483
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,880
questions or want them to do some custom

484
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,700
queries or you know tease out some some

485
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,159
insights you know that maybe you have

486
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,620
some ideas related to

487
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,299
um they're great about that stuff

488
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,700
and then failing that like I did you

489
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,260
know and start to gather the data

490
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,020
yourself again a lot of people jumped in

491
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,100
and helped me out with that

492
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,980
if you see a bad stat don't just accuse

493
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,320
your marketing team you know don't don't

494
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,360
you know just tell them to take down

495
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,880
that bad stat help them out you know

496
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,179
some marketing folks you know they're

497
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,679
not uh wired to go do due diligence on

498
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,140
every single stat maybe you know find

499
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,480
something they can replace it with you

500
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,580
know help them out a little bit don't

501
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,799
just uh don't just jump at them

502
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,020
um also encourage encourage them or if

503
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,820
it's you that's using some of these

504
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,059
stats uh you know include important

505
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:10,220
context like the number of uh uh

506
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,919
respondents to a survey for example

507
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,900
and also

508
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,020
I think statistics should be used to

509
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,280
carry

510
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,620
the story to further the story somewhat

511
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,440
a statistic should be the tip of the

512
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,020
iceberg of the conversation that you're

513
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,419
going to have not a blunt weapon like

514
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,700
that six trillion dollar number you know

515
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,740
like these maxims that are just made to

516
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,400
to strike fear and things like that uh

517
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
you know and assume that when you use

518
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,140
statistics you know that it's uh the

519
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,240
beginning of a conversation somebody's

520
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,000
gonna ask you about that statistic want

521
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,919
to dive deeper into it and have a

522
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,539
conversation about it

523
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,000
and again uh like I've done with my

524
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,980
research if you put together your own

525
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,419
data consider sharing it

526
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,240
finally I think it's worth uh pulling

527
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,980
out the truth because the truth is just

528
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,960
more interesting

529
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,320
um add more time to your presentations

530
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,280
uh so

531
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,440
well to your prep time for putting

532
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,539
together presentations so that you can

533
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,000
check your facts at figures or maybe if

534
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,440
you have somebody working for you that

535
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,419
can do that for you or maybe go hire

536
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,580
somebody on Fiverr that can check your

537
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,559
facts and figures

538
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,480
um I'm not sure if people on Fiverr do

539
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,900
that but it would be great if they did

540
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,039
and uh and if you spot a bad stat nicely

541
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,900
tell somebody you know that they might

542
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,580
want to replace that

543
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,080
thanks for listening to my talk
