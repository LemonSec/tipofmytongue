00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,640
hello everyone I am Marcus Hodges I am a

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,500
security partner at meta and I support

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
our augmented reality Division and today

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,760
I'm going to be talking with you about

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,119
meaningful Hardware privacy features

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,119
so there are many smart home wearable

8
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,460
and virtual reality devices on the

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,020
market today

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,480
an augmented reality products are

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
emerging we have Smart speakers with

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,620
cameras and conversational voice

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,660
assistants in our living rooms and

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,000
virtual reality devices feature a range

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,940
of sensors for immersive experiences

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,579
wearable devices such as Ray-Ban stories

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,559
are the Forerunner to the augmented

18
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,940
reality glasses of the future

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,920
but with these new technologies come new

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,739
security and privacy risks these devices

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,739
have a lot of sensors that in some cases

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,659
are always on

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,939
they may be permanent fixtures of our

24
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,880
living rooms or our home offices are

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,979
something we take with us everywhere we

26
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:14,700
go

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,740
and there are many private and

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,380
semi-private spaces in the world that we

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,700
need to consider such as public

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,759
restrooms medical clinics daycares and

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,960
many more

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,540
where people have a strong expectation

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,960
of privacy in these private spaces

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,820
and we need to consider many risks

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,560
including those of malware and

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,600
inauthentic applications with excessive

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,119
permissions

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,579
so to help mitigate some of these risks

39
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,880
there are two emerging Hardware privacy

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,860
features that are becoming increasingly

41
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,119
important

42
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,820
the first of these is the sensor mute

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,880
switch which disables sensors such as

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,920
the cameras and microphones on your

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,820
device

46
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,460
and it's effectively a manual override

47
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,560
that gives the user direct control over

48
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,860
the sensors and experiences

49
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,000
the second is the record indication LED

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
this led indicates to users and

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,220
bystanders when cameras or microphones

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,459
or other sensors are actively recording

53
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,220
now the color of this led its blink

54
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,500
pattern and what exactly it's indicating

55
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,560
depends upon the device and as we'll see

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,040
later its exact meaning is deceptively

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,060
simple

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,459
so today I'm going to talk about how

59
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,980
these features are designed what makes

60
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,739
them secure and it'll explain why

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,540
augmented reality is going to make

62
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,180
everything more complicated

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,060
so to start it's helpful to consider the

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,879
levels of trust and platform security

65
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,360
user applications have the least amount

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,599
of trust arguably untrusted and Hardware

67
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,120
has the most trust but there is a

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,220
gradient in between which includes the

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,860
operating system kernel and firmware and

70
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,599
other elements

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,540
now we say that a system provides

72
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,959
Hardware security Assurance if it is

73
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,700
immutable and isolated

74
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,920
immutability is a unique property of

75
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,620
hardware and this is what makes the

76
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,260
initial boot ROMs secure and make secure

77
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,159
boot possible

78
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,900
immutability and Hardware security

79
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,239
Assurance will protect against software

80
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,099
attacks at all privilege levels

81
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,140
including a compromised operating system

82
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,099
or firmware but there is a catch systems

83
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,459
that are immutable cannot be updated and

84
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,099
so they need to be simple effective and

85
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,000
easy to validate

86
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,440
the design of the sensor mute switch

87
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
begins with a fundamental question

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,840
how do you disable a sensor now the

89
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,700
first and most obvious approach is to

90
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,920
Simply turn off the power but if it were

91
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,840
that easy I wouldn't be standing here

92
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,940
right now

93
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,980
so let's look at a typical camera sensor

94
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,680
and consider the option space

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,580
uh every electrical component including

96
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,379
sensors like cameras and microphones

97
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,738
have what is called a pin out

98
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,040
a pin out is the diagram of the

99
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,560
electrical connections that are used to

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,380
power and communicate with the sensor

101
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,720
now it doesn't matter if these pins are

102
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,300
actually pins or if they're wires or if

103
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,220
they're traces buried deep in a circuit

104
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,000
board this is simply the electrical API

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
now this is the pin out for a simple

106
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,960
camera sensor and as you can see we have

107
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,780
pins for Power Clock reset ground and

108
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,419
there are sets of pins for the mipi and

109
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,300
I squared C data buses

110
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,419
now I said before you can't simply cut

111
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,300
the power to a sensor and this is

112
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,820
because severing power suddenly can

113
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,919
cause voltage spikes and other really

114
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,979
bad electrical phenomena to happen which

115
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,139
is why in practice when we're designing

116
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,900
Hardware components are usually powered

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,940
with something called a pmic or a power

118
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,460
management integrated circuit that

119
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,860
brings voltage and power up and down

120
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,340
smoothly gracefully

121
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,020
and the other thing to keep in mind

122
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,380
about power is that there could be a

123
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,080
single power rail traversing A system

124
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,720
that lots of components are connected to

125
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,320
and disabling the power might disable a

126
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,940
sensor but it might disable half of the

127
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,500
system with it so you may not have

128
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,139
individual control over power the way

129
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,360
you would perhaps assume or expect or

130
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,580
want

131
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,060
now the real goal of disabling a sensor

132
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,699
isn't exactly to power it off per se

133
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,000
what we're trying to accomplish is with

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the prevention of flow of data to

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,699
protect privacy so one thing we can

136
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,380
consider is to turn off the data wires

137
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,800
now most electrical buses have many

138
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,460
wires that operate together so that bits

139
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,460
of data can be transmitted in parallel

140
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,759
so disabling an electrical bus means

141
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,280
putting a gator a transistor on each of

142
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
these wires so we can turn them off

143
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,080
simultaneously and this increases

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,819
complexity

145
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,199
also

146
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,900
these high-speed transmission wires for

147
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,479
data are often very sensitive to changes

148
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,539
in electrical properties like impedance

149
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:35,520
so it's not so simple to Simply turn

150
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,259
them off and add components in the

151
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,380
middle

152
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,900
now there are

153
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,840
a lot of sensors in the world

154
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,460
and

155
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,259
oh sorry

156
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,300
um there may also be more than one data

157
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,220
bus in a system so in this particular

158
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,419
case

159
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,180
uh we have the mipi data bus at the top

160
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,340
and this is where the pixels of an image

161
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,620
are transmit so the bits of data

162
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,020
actually flow over the mipi bus but the

163
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,660
I squared C data bus is used for command

164
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,819
and control for sending commands to the

165
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,699
camera for like setting the aperture

166
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,220
frame rate resolution starting the

167
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,900
capture of a video or something like

168
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,460
this and so we might have to turn off

169
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,259
more than one data bus and this also

170
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,919
increases complexity and subtly severing

171
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,139
data connections a lot like disabling

172
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,479
the power suddenly can have unintended

173
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,699
side effects especially on firmware that

174
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:33,840
might be in the middle of some

175
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,880
communication you know this is a little

176
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,880
bit like cutting a phone line in the

177
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
middle of a conversation

178
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,360
so in our exploration we discovered that

179
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
holding cameras in reset is by far the

180
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,479
best way to disable a camera sensor the

181
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,300
reset pin is effectively equivalent to

182
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,400
rebooting the device and holding it in

183
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,919
the rebooted State and this is a very

184
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,560
effective way to disable a camera sensor

185
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,720
and it also has the benefit of being a

186
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,000
single wire solution

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,039
now let's look at the microphone for a

188
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,280
bit the microphone typically has a very

189
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,620
simple pin out that includes four wires

190
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,280
Power Clock data and ground

191
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,220
um PDM microphones use the input clock

192
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,280
signal to modulate sound which is then

193
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,800
transmitted out the data line

194
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,319
in our research we discovered that

195
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,360
certain microphone manufacturers

196
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,880
actually have enough internal voltage

197
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,760
bleed from the clock signal to

198
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,860
sufficiently power the sensor and get

199
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,380
data off of it even if you completely

200
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,839
cut the power and this is somewhat

201
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:45,720
surprising and once again we find that

202
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,880
powering off the device is not the most

203
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,940
secure private option so in this case we

204
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,399
recommend gating the clock or the data

205
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,200
or both

206
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,300
now let's look at a couple of examples

207
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,279
of these features in the wild

208
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,160
Apple's MacBooks and other Apple

209
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,140
products feature a hardware microphone

210
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,980
disconnect which is built into the lid

211
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,260
and this lid of your device is acts as a

212
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,300
switch so that when the lid is closed

213
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,339
the microphone is disabled purely in

214
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,620
Hardware now this is resilient to

215
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,240
software attacks at all privilege levels

216
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
including a compromised operating system

217
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
so that those you know compromised

218
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,019
pieces of software could not gain access

219
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,000
to your microphone with the lid of your

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,540
cam or of your MacBook closed and

221
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,580
it also turns out that with the lid

222
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,500
closed the camera's field of view is

223
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,180
completely obstruction so you get that

224
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,459
for free which is great

225
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,500
um Amazon smart speaker is another great

226
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,200
example of a device that has a mute

227
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,019
switch with Hardware security assurance

228
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,899
in their design the button switches

229
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,480
power between the microphone and a red

230
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,200
LED so that only one can have power at a

231
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,120
time

232
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
and this is elegant

233
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,680
but note the use of a button instead of

234
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,320
a switch requires that you have an LED

235
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
so you can tell what state the system is

236
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,720
in whether the sensors are on or off and

237
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,480
this is important not to conflate this

238
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,519
particular LED with the record

239
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,860
indication LED we'll talk about in a

240
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,980
minute

241
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,880
so let's talk about the full system

242
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,140
design

243
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,959
if you have a single camera microphone

244
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,000
you want to disable wiring it to the

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
switches straightly more or less

246
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,300
straightforward now if you have many

247
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,980
cameras and sensors you want to disable

248
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,620
with the mute switch you can daisy chain

249
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,720
them like I have in this design but this

250
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
is many drawbacks

251
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,519
um first you need to notify the

252
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,380
operating system device drivers and

253
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,120
other components that you're about to

254
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,579
shut off sensors before they suddenly

255
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,899
disappear

256
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,459
and second

257
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:54,180
you know there are many

258
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,700
there are many sensors in the world and

259
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,500
it's not always straightforward to know

260
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,360
exactly which ones you should turn out

261
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,420
turn off uh you know it turns out that

262
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,660
Imus or inertial management units are

263
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,600
often sensitive enough to record audio

264
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,940
and temperature sensors can be used to

265
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,339
monitor certain Health characteristics

266
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,040
but disabling a temperature sensor could

267
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,500
render a device extremely unsafe for the

268
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,600
user and so there are a lot of

269
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,000
trade-offs to be considered

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,940
and that might also impact usability a

271
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,760
lot disabling the sensors

272
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,279
you know these devices do not have

273
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,399
keyboards or mics for user input so all

274
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,079
of the interaction you have with them

275
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,079
comes in via the sensors smart speakers

276
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,300
are a good example of this if you turn

277
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,279
off the microphone to a Smart speaker

278
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,500
you can't communicate and interact with

279
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,720
that device at that point in time which

280
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,579
is to some extent the point but you need

281
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,260
to think about the impact of on

282
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,300
usability when you're making these

283
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,500
decisions

284
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,459
so it is a desirable property to

285
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,560
preserve optionality in your Hardware

286
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,079
design until later in the manufacturing

287
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,399
process

288
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,140
but when you think about preserve an

289
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,200
optionality this is actually completely

290
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,600
at odds with the concept of Hardware

291
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,740
security assurance and immutability

292
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,700
so one thing we can do is to include a

293
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,920
one-time programmable microcontroller

294
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,839
like a cpld

295
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:27,060
now the one-time programmability of

296
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,459
certain microcontrollers allows you to

297
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,800
have late binding optionality over the

298
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,200
logic and sensors and which sensors

299
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,079
might be disabled and it still provides

300
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,060
Hardware security Assurance because once

301
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,339
it's programmed it's immutable from then

302
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,139
forward

303
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,200
now the inclusion of a microcontroller

304
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,480
logic like this also allows you to

305
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,839
include Implement us like a time delay

306
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
so that you can notify the operating

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,459
system and drivers before you bring the

308
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,560
sensors down hard

309
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,360
there is a downside of this design

310
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,360
though is that it takes up a lot of

311
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,399
physical space especially if you have

312
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,920
one wire for every camera and if you

313
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,899
have a dozen cameras that's a dozen

314
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,240
traces on your circuit board and that

315
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,720
may not be space you have especially in

316
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,060
a constrained form factor like a pair of

317
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,279
glasses

318
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,700
so one way we can address some of these

319
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,940
challenges is by taking the design and

320
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,639
moving it into custom silicon inside the

321
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,320
system on a chip

322
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,839
in this design the switch is wired

323
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,360
directly to our system monitor chip and

324
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,839
routed internally to two places

325
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,779
the first is an uninterruptible timer

326
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,120
which delays for a few hundred

327
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,579
milliseconds and then shuts down the

328
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:48,899
sensors

329
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,240
the second is the root of trust or

330
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,100
firmware in the root of trust which

331
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,079
becomes the system that is responsible

332
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,440
for notifying the operating system and

333
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,540
bringing the sensors and related

334
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,940
components down cleanly and smoothly

335
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,040
before they get disabled in Hardware

336
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,500
suddenly

337
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,800
in this design instead of holding the

338
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,560
cameras themselves in reset to disable

339
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,040
them what we're doing is holding the C5

340
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,820
receivers inside the chip in reset it's

341
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,339
the same technique to disable the sensor

342
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,680
but we're doing it internally instead of

343
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,160
externally now the C5 receivers are the

344
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,500
component that the cameras are wired

345
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,240
directly to

346
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,959
and so disabling them is as effective as

347
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,300
disabling the camera but it takes up

348
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,060
considerably less space

349
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,300
but like everything this also has a

350
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,579
downside or before I talk about the

351
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,100
downside you know this is turning off

352
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,980
the C5 receiver is a little bit like me

353
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,839
turning off my cell phone so you can't

354
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,800
call me using the phone analogy again uh

355
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
so the downside of this is that

356
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,600
it's very difficult for an external

357
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,399
researcher to validate you know it's

358
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,440
custom silicon it's very small not

359
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,480
impossible but it raises the bar a lot

360
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,899
and I do consider that a downside

361
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,240
all right let's shift our attention from

362
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,480
the mute switch the disabled sensors to

363
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,000
the record indication LED that tells you

364
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,399
when things are actively recording now

365
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,000
the Ray-Ban stories LED is hardwired

366
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,959
directly to the camera sensor power if

367
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,240
the camera is powered on

368
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,100
the LED is on

369
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,260
vice versa

370
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,880
this is simple

371
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,880
it's easy to understand and it provides

372
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,519
robust Hardware security assurance

373
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,100
but I'd like you to note a very subtle

374
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,500
difference between a camera being

375
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,680
powered on and a camera actively

376
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,459
recorded

377
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,820
electrically active recording might be a

378
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,980
little bit more akin to there's bits of

379
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,800
data flowing off of the sensor over a

380
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,120
shared bus

381
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,880
but monitoring that bus to see if data

382
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,500
is being transmitted and somehow or

383
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,079
another wiring an LED to that

384
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,000
Not only would be incredibly difficult

385
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
but you probably couldn't do this with

386
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,560
any security Assurance at all

387
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,899
so the implication of this particular

388
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,600
design is you actually have to turn off

389
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,820
the cameras or power them off when

390
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,459
they're not actively in use

391
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,980
otherwise the light would be on all the

392
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,779
time

393
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,360
now Amazon smart speaker takes an

394
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,300
entirely different approach

395
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,959
the microphone is normally on and

396
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,360
listening for a wake word you know

397
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,880
phrases like hey Alexa I'm waiting for

398
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,019
somebody's device to go up

399
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,459
um I always do that on purpose

400
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,779
um so it's listening for a wake word

401
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,420
right but the light is actually off that

402
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,779
entire time and the light only comes on

403
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:03,600
once a wake word is detected and data

404
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,220
starts streaming to the cloud

405
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,240
now as you may have guessed this would

406
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,160
be very difficult to design with

407
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,199
Hardware security Assurance this is a

408
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,939
higher order concept wake word

409
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,040
processing

410
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,000
it does provide certain restricted

411
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,240
functionality to gives it the ability to

412
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,819
access sensor data again without that

413
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,059
light being on all of the time

414
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,460
and this is an important and admirable

415
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,799
quality for several reasons

416
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,480
now as we know wake words are

417
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,299
probabilistic and we all have first-hand

418
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,400
experiences where these devices have

419
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,880
been activated accidentally so this is a

420
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,780
good example of how the privacy or the

421
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,640
um the sensor mute switch and the record

422
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,340
indication Hardware LED actually

423
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,260
complement each other really nicely as

424
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,580
features that go well together

425
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,960
when we get to augmented reality

426
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,960
the world gets more complicated

427
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,660
in addition to the cameras and

428
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,880
microphones that will be there so the

429
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,460
user can capture photos and videos of

430
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,380
their experience and share them with

431
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,419
their friends and family there are going

432
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,320
to be many cameras and sensors for all

433
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,720
sorts of environmental processing

434
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,400
there'll be cameras and sensors for

435
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,679
mapping your spatial environment and

436
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,080
detecting your location within that

437
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,260
space and you know they'll be because

438
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,480
remember these devices do not have

439
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,120
keyboards or mice so all of the user

440
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,360
input comes in Via these sensors so

441
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,340
you'll probably have sensors or cameras

442
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,580
for hand tracking for user input or

443
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,380
monitoring your you know your eye

444
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,679
location so it knows you know where

445
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,780
you're looking for user input right and

446
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,559
just a wide variety of sensors

447
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,059
microphones will be used for hands-free

448
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,500
voice control

449
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,960
and dictation

450
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,240
so let me ask you the question

451
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
now what does this led mean

452
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,740
does it mean that sensors or cameras are

453
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,480
on which cameras

454
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,700
for what purpose

455
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,480
and this brings me to the concept or the

456
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,500
issue of LED semantics

457
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,780
what does the LED mean

458
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,179
that sensors are on

459
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:31,700
powered on which sensors

460
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,559
doesn't mean they're actively recording

461
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,960
and does that mean that data is Flowing

462
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,960
like bits from the sensors or the data

463
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,760
is streaming to the cloud

464
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,700
or the data is persisted somewhere such

465
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,100
that it may be accessible to the user or

466
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,500
the provider

467
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,320
and do we want this led on for machine

468
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,760
perception

469
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,120
such as wake words or spatial mapping or

470
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,419
hand tracking or computer vision tasks

471
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,780
and to answer these questions we need to

472
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,059
consider very carefully all of the

473
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,260
Privacy implications of these things

474
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:12,120
is a feature always on

475
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,240
processing in the background or is it

476
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,039
user activated

477
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,559
is the data being processed ephemerally

478
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,220
is it processed in a secure Enclave

479
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,400
how high a Fidelity is the data or the

480
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,100
derivation of the data and how is it

481
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,520
being used you know if this light is on

482
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,700
all of the time it will quickly lead to

483
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,039
alert fatigue and it become less

484
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,179
meaningful

485
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,400
but where do we draw the line

486
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,660
so today I want to leave you with a few

487
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,419
takeaways and a call to action

488
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,080
and perhaps more questions than answers

489
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,320
so today I explained how to design a

490
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,940
sensor mute switch with Hardware

491
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,179
security Assurance that's robust and

492
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,799
meaningful

493
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,340
but Hardware is hard

494
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,919
and it takes a significant investment in

495
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
security and privacy to design and build

496
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,919
features like this

497
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:15,780
we also saw that this led has

498
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,820
complicated semantics that are already

499
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,679
overloaded and mean many different

500
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,960
things and when we get to augmented

501
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,820
reality this is going to become even

502
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,160
more problematic

503
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,559
so we need to come together as an

504
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,500
industry to align on standards to ensure

505
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,900
that these Hardware privacy features

506
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,220
continue to be secure and meaningful

507
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,320
and now I'd also like to point out that

508
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,020
it is a particularly good time right now

509
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,840
to be researching these topics and these

510
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,460
open questions there's a good

511
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,500
opportunity here to influence the

512
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,440
industry how these things are designed

513
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,299
and what they're for so I invite all of

514
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,960

515
