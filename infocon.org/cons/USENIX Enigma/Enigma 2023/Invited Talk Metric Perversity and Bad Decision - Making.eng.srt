1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,619
so what you get today is me ranting for

3
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,539
20 minutes about something that I care

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,820
very deeply about which is metric

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,460
perversity and the incredibly bad

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,140
decisions that it makes everybody make

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,660
like people make bad decisions about

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,580
security privacy trust and safety

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,500
because they don't care because they

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,820
don't know they should care and they

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,680
don't know what to care about but the

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,300
thing that I see people make bad

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,940
decisions about this more than anything

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,840
it's because they have bad metrics now

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,820
I've seen a lot of bad decisions I was

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,219
the CSO of Twitter uh I was the global

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,739
lead of privacy technology at Google I

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,079
came in to help clean up Zoom after they

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,820
had their problems a little couple of

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,899
years ago

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,879
I've seen people make a lot of very bad

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
decisions that sometimes why people hire

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,539
me I've also seen people make really

24
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,579
good decisions so I want to help you

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,559
make better decisions

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:05,939
so

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,100
we're going to talk about metrics

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,680
what is a metric a metric is a

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,880
quantifiable measurement to figure out

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,220
whether you're doing well or not at a

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,360
particular thing

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,760
a goal metric is something that tells

33
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,100
you whether you're meeting your goals so

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,200
are do you have a bunch of users are

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,540
they happy are you making money things

36
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,360
like that a program metric tells you

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,880
whether you are making progress on your

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,460
planned work are people annotating their

39
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,040
data sets are people writing the code

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,360
they're supposed to write are you

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,460
meeting your program goals

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,920
I am only talking about goal metrics

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,740
today uh not about program metrics so

44
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,820
one example

45
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,280
mdel you know for those of you who know

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,100
anything about Twitter mdow is the

47
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,520
average number of people where they're

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,659
showing up and doing something that

49
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,280
could potentially cause them to see an

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,000
ad

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,040
now it's a little complicated to measure

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,740
uh this caused a bunch of people to

53
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,399
start suing each other but it is mostly

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,220
aimed at investors and what do investors

55
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,300
care about

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,599
how much money they're making right so

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,580
does this number kind of like correlate

58
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,200
you can kind of see I you can actually

59
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,700
see I pulled this off of the Twitter

60
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,319
investor site you can see who this is

61
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,840
aimed at but they kind of

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,120
correlate with each other so this m down

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,200
measurement is a pretty good metric

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,020
so let's talk about the bad ones what is

65
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,599
a perverse metric a perverse metric is

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,640
one that doesn't actually tell you what

67
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,980
you think it's telling you and then that

68
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,420
causes you to make bad decisions about

69
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,379
it right

70
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,140
making data-driven decisions is in fact

71
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,459
great

72
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,319
humans do not have the i o or the

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,879
processing capacity to work with the

74
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,500
complexity of the world we use

75
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,379
heuristics we use implicit biases we

76
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,720
Overlook look the unexpected

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,420
humans often Overlook bad news they just

78
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,099
don't want to Grapple with it now I know

79
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,480
that's a little less common in this room

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,360
because we all chose to work in the

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,239
field of oh no terrible things but even

82
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,280
we will do it right

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,879
now this especially often impacts

84
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,040
security privacy and trust and safety

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,440
we have adversaries we have unknowns we

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,200
have little tiny risks lots and lots of

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,780
them that have critical impacts so it's

88
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,000
very very hard for us to have good

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,599
metrics

90
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,019
so we're going to go through all the

91
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,840
different kinds of bad metrics and then

92
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,120
we are going to go through how to avoid

93
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,379
it

94
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,659
the first kind of bad metric that people

95
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,900
will show up with a lot is a metric that

96
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,480
measures effort not result if you are

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,580
somebody's c-level executive or you're

98
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,099
they're bored they really want to tell

99
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,599
you how hard they're working and that's

100
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,540
very legitimate but unfortunately effort

101
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,000
and results not the same thing even

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,099
vaguely right

103
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,080
so I'm going to show you a real example

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,780
these so these are all real world actual

105
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,459
companies that I have worked at examples

106
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:03,599
and I'm not going to name any of the

107
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,760
companies but there was a company level

108
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,220
goal that some of you are giggling about

109
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,400
now where it was we're going to send end

110
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,860
notifications this quarter for a very

111
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,380
very large value of n

112
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,779
ah great if you ever set one of those

113
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,180
goals around me let me tell you I could

114
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,919
hit that goal tomorrow

115
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,320
you are going to be extremely sad about

116
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,060
it though because if you set a goal like

117
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,580
that I will make sure that every single

118
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,440
one of those notifications melts your

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,780
phone into the ground so that you know

120
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,400
never ever ever to set a metric like

121
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,560
that again

122
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,800
second one just because you can measure

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,300
something doesn't actually mean it's

124
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,940
important people pay so much attention

125
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,800
to metrics this is actually part of the

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
power of metrics right they go and they

127
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,400
want to change them and they pay

128
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,960
attention to them

129
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,660
but sometimes that's really bad so there

130
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,400
was a team that I took over management

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,100
of a while ago and uh

132
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,840
they were told that they were slowing

133
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,280
down launches too much they were

134
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,479
reviewing launches before they happened

135
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,160
and they're like okay well how do we not

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,660
piss everybody off we're going to Res

137
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,460
we're going to get things moving a lot

138
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,800
faster okay so they're going to measure

139
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,620
from when somebody files for a review

140
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,960
until that review starts

141
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,460
and I'm going to defend this metric

142
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,740
before I make fun of it okay so

143
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,139
it is really hard to measure how long a

144
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,880
launch review takes it can take months

145
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
of very close collaboration sometimes a

146
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,139
launch really should be slowed down

147
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,960
because that is not a good launch

148
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,580
sometimes uh teams that want to launch

149
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,620
things they're like I would want to

150
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,940
launch this thing and you're like what

151
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,160
do you want to launch and they're like

152
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,600
I don't know I didn't write it in the

153
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,120
document or they don't answer questions

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,560
so

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,720
this team is trying to minimize the time

156
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,419
to First Response on tickets so the very

157
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,039
predictable thing immediately happened

158
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,419
which is the members of that team

159
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,759
started responding to review tickets

160
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,860
with hello

161
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,280
thank you for filing a review ticket we

162
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,979
will respond to your ticket in the order

163
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,900
in which it was filed

164
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,240
thank you for choosing to have a review

165
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,979
before you launch

166
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,280
so this did not actually piss off the

167
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,520
rest of the company any less shocking

168
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,080
um

169
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,520
but

170
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,400
the first response to those tickets it

171
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,800
was so fast it was so useless and so

172
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,759
fast

173
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,319
so when I took over that team you know

174
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,000
what we did we stopped measuring

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,340
literally just stop measuring and you

176
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,199
know what people got less pissed off at

177
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,419
us now we did a lot of other things in

178
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:38,699
the in parallel but I want to emphasize

179
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,460
this not measuring just not measuring

180
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,340
led us to better results

181
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,380
you need to use metrics to direct

182
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,720
attention where you want it

183
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,000
using a gauge is a lever okay

184
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
gauges indicated that a system is

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,560
working well but it does it indirectly

186
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,419
you use these because it is often

187
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,100
impossible to measure things in practice

188
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,979
without a gap it is creepy illegal and

189
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:03,539
impossible to reach directly into the

190
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:04,800
brains of every one of your users and

191
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,080
say are you happy with us do you want to

192
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,000
use our product again even if that's

193
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,220
what you want to know

194
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,479
if you are the social sort of person and

195
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,919
you go to parties I hear a rumor that

196
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,300
like social interaction happens there

197
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,039
and like people talk maybe there's music

198
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,960
maybe there's dancing then the more

199
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,060
interaction there is the more noise

200
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,220
there is so you might go ah

201
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,259
how much noise there is at a party tells

202
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,720
me whether it's a good party or not

203
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,759
but if I believe that then the party

204
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,680
with a Grenade on the table definitely

205
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,319
the best party right

206
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,539
okay but a real world example

207
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,280
I worked on a social product I've worked

208
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,240
on a number of them not going to tell

209
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,139
you which

210
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,060
they really wanted to increase the

211
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,740
number of connections between users of

212
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,539
that product and that's because

213
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,960
in order to do social things

214
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,759
usually people have to like connect to

215
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,020
each other right

216
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,180
but not all connections are good and so

217
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,340
when those product managers said we are

218
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,780
going to make more connections happen

219
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,819
they made a lot of bad connections

220
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,500
happen we actually went back and looked

221
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,319
later

222
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,120
and there were a bunch of men of various

223
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,280
ages who were really focused on

224
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,380
connecting with some young women

225
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,539
and you know what those were not good

226
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,880
interactions and that is the sort of

227
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,740
thing that happens when you use a gauge

228
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,620
as a lever it was bad for the product it

229
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,960
was bad for users

230
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,900
to try not to use a gauge as a lever

231
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,580
your adversaries also don't help you

232
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,479
measure

233
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,220
adversaries are tautologically

234
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,039
adversarial um maybe you want to stop

235
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,599
them though so you're like okay I'm

236
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,458
going to use machine learning I'm going

237
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,899
to put all my data in there and I'm

238
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,399
going to find the anomalies I'm going to

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,958
stop them and the first thing that

240
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,458
happens when you try this is you get a

241
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,899
bunch of alerts out

242
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,459
and the poor team that has to deal with

243
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,339
the alerts is like what is this crap I

244
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,839
don't know what to do with any of this

245
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,300
this isn't actually bad behavior or I

246
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,940
don't know what to do with this alert so

247
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,800
what people do is they start measuring

248
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,300
those alerts that are coming out are

249
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,519
they actually useful and you know how

250
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,440
much security software people try to

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
sell you with that metric

252
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,839
so much and here's the thing

253
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,120
it doesn't help you because what happens

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,820
is what they're not telling you is how

255
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,519
much bad behavior they're not detecting

256
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,320
and you know what the adversaries they

257
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,459
don't want to be detected so they're

258
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,380
super cool with this they're not going

259
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,120
to make it easy for you

260
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,220
uh by the way privacy people don't get

261
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,560
smugged because privacy Tech does the

262
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,240
same thing but worse

263
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,680
so

264
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,480
if you're running a security program or

265
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,339
a privacy program one of the real life

266
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,560
places you run into this is incident

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,480
vulnerability statistics and it drives

268
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,000
me up the wall that people say I want to

269
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
drive down my incident in vulnerability

270
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,640
statistics

271
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,620
now on one level yes those are bad

272
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,959
things I would like them to go away

273
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,120
on a more important level

274
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,040
they're very high variants they're very

275
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,140
noisy and they are often driven in part

276
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,839
by large part by employing external

277
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,820
reports right

278
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,700
I really need people to actually respond

279
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,440
I need people to tell me when

280
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,300
something's gone wrong because the

281
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,519
easiest way to drive down your stats is

282
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,620
to discourage people from reporting and

283
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,300
this is what actually happens people are

284
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,560
like

285
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,300
product team why do you have so many

286
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,220
incident reports it's because they're

287
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,380
paying attention and telling you the

288
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,880
easiest way to make their numbers go

289
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,459
down is just to not tell you anymore

290
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,620
so your metrics can only be as good as

291
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,120
your data even if that data is

292
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,660
manipulated

293
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,899
tautologically and they have uncertainty

294
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,060
many of the estimates that we use in

295
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,860
security privacy trust and safety and so

296
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,680
forth have so much uncertainty that they

297
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,920
are in fact useless

298
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,300
so let me give you an example one of the

299
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,740
things that I get asked for is things

300
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,880
like well how much risk are we taking by

301
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,399
making that vulnerability fixed take

302
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,040
longer like what if we delay it okay

303
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,800
expected value probability times times

304
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,100
impact right okay uh so I want to figure

305
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,540
out the probability the risk of

306
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,160
exploitation let's take into account all

307
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,300
of our different layers of protection

308
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,680
and how they interact what is the

309
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,540
adversary doing did they take a vacation

310
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,339
are they looking at the company next

311
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,959
door did everybody start looking at this

312
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
vulnerability right now I don't know it

313
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,700
is a definitely an ex an estimate

314
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,820
the impact of the exploitation okay we

315
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,899
need to take into account the direct

316
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,000
Breakers the indirect breakage uh

317
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
kicking out the attackers keeping them

318
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,660
out emergency fixes fixes on other

319

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,399
future and oh yeah user and customer

323
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,079
Trust

324
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,060
this is an estimate right this is an

325
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,100
estimate with a huge amount of variance

326
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,920
on it and then because statistics when

327
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,480
you multiply one thing with a lot of

328
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,980
uncertainty by another thing with a lot

329
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,180
of uncertainty you get something with

330
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,519
even more uncertainty and there is so

331
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,720
much uncertainty that that number is

332
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,459
useless one of the ways that we find

333
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,959
this a lot is we look at that number and

334
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,399
we're like oh it's larger than the

335
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,160
market capitalization of the company

336
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,260
everybody should just stop everything

337
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,180
they're doing and only work on this

338
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,339
vulnerability no sometimes that is the

339
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,220
case but it often it isn't and sometimes

340
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,540
we end up with this little tiny number

341
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,680
and we're like oh I can put that on my

342
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,700
corporate credit card I'm just going to

343
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,860
ignore this seems weird it seems like a

344
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,800
really bad Vault right and sometimes you

345
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,940
end up with a number that looks super

346
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,920
reasonable and you're like oh great a

347
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,300
real number

348
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,220
no no that's a coincidence that's not a

349
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,360
real number

350
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,220
there is so much uncertainty that that

351
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,560
number is useless

352
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,260
so you need to watch your uncertainty

353
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,760
you also didn't think to measure the

354
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,740
black swans you can only the measure the

355
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,940
things that you think to measure and you

356
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,899
can't measure all of them because

357
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,700
otherwise your log system is way bigger

358
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,740
than your actual system

359
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,779
a Black Swan is an unanticipated event

360
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,000
with Major Impact so in security we

361
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,139
often think of things like meltdown

362
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,899
inspector where all the processors are

363
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,000
full of bad bad bugs

364
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,279
and it's really hard to fix them

365
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,260
and everybody's owned and it's really

366
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,839
really really hard to mitigate the

367
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,339
problem

368
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,779
here's the thing we have a lot of

369
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,880
studies about Black Swan events they

370
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,820
show up more often and have more impact

371
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,740
you than you'd think this is very

372
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,320
consistent across a lot of fields

373
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,779
and measuring black swans has all of the

374
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,279
problems of measuring the impacts of

375
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,959
unlikely risks in general like we just

376
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:16,920
discussed

377
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,740
but it also has this problem that you

378
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,180
are specifically trying to measure

379
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,980
things that you don't know about so

380
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,260
here's the thing you do not know how

381
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,740
wrong you are but you know you're wrong

382
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,260
okay I'm not gonna make you sad all day

383
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,939
let's talk about how to avoid this

384
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,260
Real Techniques to do this okay jerk

385
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,339
Genie

386
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,380
The Jerk Genie is my friend

387
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,800
they are all powerful they are extremely

388
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,240
literal and they are going to make your

389
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,560
dreams come true

390
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,200
do you want to have good usage numbers

391
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,839
no problem you've had a DDOS attack oh

392
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,120
did you want to get your project done

393
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,120
done now nobody uses your system it

394
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,920
doesn't solve any problems and if you

395
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,180
hadn't been focusing on your program

396
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,500
metrics you might have noticed that

397
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,420
there was a way to solve the problem in

398
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,560
half the time

399
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,420
they are going to make your metric

400
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,579
dreams come true in the worst way

401
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,860
possible you should be thinking about

402
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,420
how they are going to mess up every

403
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,700
single metric you have every single

404
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,160
project goal you have I promise you this

405
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,100
will make you make better choices about

406
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,839
what you work on

407
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,660
people who have worked with me can in

408
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,820
fact vouch for this

409
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,620
uh another technique you can use is

410
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,720
guard metrics sometimes you need to use

411
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,279
a perverse metric like it is not

412
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,100
actually possible to not use a gauge you

413
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,139
can't measure the thing you really want

414
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,660
sort of installing

415
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,040
electrodes in people's brains or

416
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,079
something so

417
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,300
what you do is you set up a guard so for

418
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,399
example okay I want to know something

419
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,079
about my usage numbers

420
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,820
there's some perversity in there but

421
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,260
we're going to go and check a little

422
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,940
sample of the traffic and see if it's

423
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,800
good that it's not spam that it's not

424
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,019
hate and it's not harassment that's not

425
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,279
a DDOS

426
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,519
if we can keep that number of bad

427
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,320
traffic down

428
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,180
then we have some really good Assurance

429
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,040
of a good statistical sample we have

430
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,240
some really good assurance that the

431
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,760
overall number is reasonable uh there's

432
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,040
another team that I worked with

433
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,019
where the perversity that they were

434
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,339
worried about is they were worried they

435
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,800
were going to launch features that

436
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,420
caused their usage numbers to spike in

437
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,680
the short term but not the long term

438
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,540
because they were just annoying their

439
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,579
core users so what they did is they said

440
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,279
we refuse to launch anything unless our

441
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,620
users love it and they had a way of

442
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,360
measuring that and they refused to

443
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,980
launch anything without it

444
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,480
wrong metrics are worse than no metrics

445
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,320
this is not me giving permission to tell

446
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,060
your sea level execs this is not me

447
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,860
permission giving you permission to tell

448
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,959
your board oh I refuse to give you any

449
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,940
numbers okay but

450
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,279
this is me giving you permission to tell

451
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
them I don't care that you want that

452
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,300
number that number is not something that

453
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,639
we can measure math says no

454
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,180
and you should tell them that we don't

455
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,100
have a way to estimate that the

456
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,399
uncertainty is not going to make it okay

457
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,079
and to keep in mind that if your data

458
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,079
can be manipulated so can your metrics

459
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,420
you should also be opinionated

460
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,519
every single time you put out a metric

461
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,079
actually every single time you put out a

462
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,600
communication you should say what do I

463
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
want somebody to do when they see that

464
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,260
thing and don't tell me you want them to

465
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,060
know something that doesn't count you

466
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,160
want them to do something so for example

467
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,500
this is very very important for

468
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,760
dashboard

469
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,320
here is my dashboard

470
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
you can see it right it's uh my

471
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,100
dashboard

472
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,800
uh vulnerabilities and somebody should

473
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,600
be looking at that dashboard going oh

474
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,519
God I gotta fix a thing

475
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,440
I need to fix a thing oh look a list of

476
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,240
things that I need to fix right I want

477
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,259
them to cause

478
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,199
to be caused to do something

479
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,880
and I'm giving you a good metric example

480
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,620
okay

481
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,300
it's really important for a lot of

482
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,339
products to say

483
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:00,839
um that they are solving products for

484
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,899
their users really quickly

485
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,819
so one metric we use for that is called

486
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,040
time to satisfaction where you say Okay

487
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,400
somebody is has showed up on my site and

488
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,939
I want to measure how long it is until

489
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,160
they have completed their task

490
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,900
okay cool

491
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,339
um sometimes you can really tell where

492
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,720
that is because you know what a task

493
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,699
completion looks like sometimes it's a

494
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,319
oh okay they left my site they're done

495
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,819
with their task

496
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,000
well is that a good metric

497
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,220
so let's test it against our techniques

498
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,980
first offer from The Jerk Genie says yes

499
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,760
I can make your metric look amazing

500
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,980
I'm gonna put up an error page

501
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,600
also it's gonna be it's going to be

502
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,460
filled with offensive words and it'll

503
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,260
just cause people to show up and leave

504
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,940
very very quickly your number is going

505
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,919
to look amazing

506
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,700
okay so do you need guard metrics yes

507
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,460
yes you do you need guard metrics right

508
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,940
we can do things like use ux research uh

509
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,380
use panels things like that to make sure

510
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,419
that people aren't being chased off we

511
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,760
can also use the things that we learned

512
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,799
today ux research to make our actual

513
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,919
measurement better we can but we can put

514
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,620
reasonable guard metrics in place

515
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,140
are those metrics wrong

516
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,299
it's actually unlikely these are pretty

517
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,700
hard to manipulate as a metric and it

518
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,860
has pretty low uncertainty

519
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,360
should we care about this metric

520
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,640
actually in a lot of in a lot of

521
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,799
products yeah we should totally care

522
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,600
about this metric

523
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,299
so this really can be an excellent if

524
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,200
imperfect metric

525
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,340
so go forth

526
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,340
build amazing things and measure them

527
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,880
well make sure that the jerk Genie is

528
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,860
your friend

529
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,260
and you're not going to have any more

530
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,419
unfortunate surprises in your life than

531
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,540
are strictly necessary thank you

532
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,799
[Applause]
