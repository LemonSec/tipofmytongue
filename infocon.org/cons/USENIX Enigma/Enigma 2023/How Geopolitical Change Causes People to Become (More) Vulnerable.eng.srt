1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,719
so I would like to say to start with a

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,600
story about security and privacy and

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,760
design and humans

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,740
and specifically this is a story about

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,420
somebody who's going through a really

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,000
big life change and using technology to

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,220
help herself through this

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,019
so when I started grad school in Seattle

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,640
about seven years ago I started

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
volunteering at a local NGO that helps

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,680
refugees and recent immigrants and one

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,180
thing that I often did

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,120
was I would go to their job class in my

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,680
volunteer slot and I would help people

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,540
with whatever computer tasks they needed

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,239
to do so it could be making a resume

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,940
managing online accounts and the online

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,680
Factor was important because most job

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,739
applications are online at this point

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,199
so one day pretty early on I was sitting

22
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,500
in the computer lab at the NGO with a

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,120
woman who I'm going to call Amina and

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,619
she was from Somalia

25
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,720
and she said she wanted my help creating

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,700
an email account

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,100
um and I wasn't totally clear on why she

28
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,020
wanted my help but I thought you know

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,220
sure this is what I'm here for I'll help

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,140
with whatever she wants and it became

31
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,960
clear pretty early on why she needed my

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,460
help and it's because she wasn't

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,860
comfortable using a keyboard and mouse

34
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,080
and I have since learned that it's very

35
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,939
common that people who come to the U.S

36
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,759
as refugees from Somalia have spent

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,280
years or even decades in refugee camps

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,159
and they don't have access to computers

39
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,900
they often have phones but no computers

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,520
so they come to the US and they may have

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,740
never used a keyboard and a mouse and

42
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,299
the mechanics of learning to type are

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,560
really difficult

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,159
so at her Direction I typed in her first

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,020
name and her last name we made her a

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,240
user account I mean a username

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,180
and then we got to the password part and

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,820
I felt uncomfortable about typing in a

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,520
password for her but she insisted that

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,439
she wanted me to do it because typing

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,820
was difficult she had a hard time

52
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,560
creating capital letters which I think

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,780
Google may have required at the time

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,360
so I said okay let's make you a password

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,979
and she said no it's okay I already have

56
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,879
one

57
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,260
um and then she gave me a four digit

58
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,980
number

59
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,800
and I thought wait what is your password

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,020
where did that number come from and I

61
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,340
think more importantly where else is it

62
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,020
being used because the way she told it

63
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,180
to me it was like this was the password

64
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,680
that she would use everywhere it was

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,020
accepted so we went back and forth a few

66
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,959
times and we were both really confused

67
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,780
and it turned out this was her ATM pin

68
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,739
um

69
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,720
and once I figured this out I explained

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,040
that this was way too short to be used

71
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,319
as an email password and and I made her

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,540
we made her a new password and I wrote

73
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,099
it down at her request and she put it in

74
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,379
her purse she got her email account and

75
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,180
then over the success of weeks of job

76
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,340
class I and other people helped her

77
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,900
apply to jobs

78
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,580
but I think as a security and privacy

79
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,560
researcher there's also a lot going on

80
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,920
here and I think there is a an argument

81
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,099
that her password creation strategy puts

82
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,780
her at risk for things like identity

83
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,940
theft and account compromise

84
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,680
but I think the more important question

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,319
is why is this happening and how did

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,659
this situation arise I think there's

87
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,220
three important things

88
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,739
the first is that refugees like her are

89
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,260
in a vulnerable polish position

90
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,080
um socially and financially they're also

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,200
heavily incentivized to apply for jobs

92
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,340
online

93
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,720
and

94
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,640
when I say heavily incentivized I mean

95
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
that there's very little support for

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,200
refugees in the U.S so amongst the

97
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,360
clients that I worked with a lot of them

98
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,159
were receiving the support that they

99
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,260
were allotted from the US government but

100
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,819
they ended up homeless at one point or

101
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,280
another the support was not enough so

102
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,260
there's this massive incentive to get a

103
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,420
job as quickly as possible and job

104
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,580
applications are online these days and

105
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,340
the third component is that to do these

106
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,200
online job applications she's using

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,879
technology that isn't built for somebody

108
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,739
with her cultural Knowledge and Skills

109
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,080
and these three things add up to put her

110
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,280
at risk for security and privacy Harms

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,440
so that's what this talk is about it's

112
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,659
about how somebody who experiences

113
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,700
geopolitical change which I'll Define in

114
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,260
a second

115
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,299
um is at increased vulnerability to

116
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,760
security and privacy Harms so for the

117
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,459
purposes of this talk

118
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,199
geopolitical change is something that is

119
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,120
driven by a massive massive political

120
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,460
event like a war um so refugees who

121
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,780
leave their home country because of a

122
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,600
war or D stay blankets and conditions or

123
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,979
it's something like a natural disaster

124
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,500
where there's a lot of policy shift or

125
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,780
government intervention

126
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,360
and stepping back for a second

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,180
why why can't we just study individual

128
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,620
populations why do we have to think

129
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,320
about this in the abstract we can and

130
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,419
should study individual populations

131
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:50,040
but I think it's important to step back

132
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,419
for a second and think about this

133
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,180
abstractly to find the common threads to

134
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,919
find the things that don't match up

135
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,100
between populations needs and threats

136
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,120
and risks

137
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,860
and I think altogether it can help us

138
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,199
support other vulnerable populations and

139
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,000
maybe find other types of vulnerability

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
that we don't really think about

141
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,720
and I think ultimately can help us

142
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,759
design for a safer and more Equitable

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,520
world

144
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,860
so what can we learn about the answer to

145
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,900
this question from the story about Amina

146
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,060
I think the first thing

147
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,160
is that refugees when they come to the

148
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,979
U.S they face new actors new threats new

149
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,500
assets new types of information new

150
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,259
technologies and when they're in this

151
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,539
transition period uh they're vulnerable

152
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,820
because how can they properly respond to

153
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,800
threats and risks if they don't know

154
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,660
what they are yet

155
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,880
I think a social security number is a

156
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,800
great example of this so how do you

157
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,120
decide who to give your social security

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,320
number to

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,539
a lot of clients told me that they were

160
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,960
told in their cultural orientation that

161
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,160
they should never give their social

162
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,620
security number to anybody and that's a

163
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,539
good rule until your caseworker asks for

164
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,680
it because they're going to help you

165
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,539
apply for jobs

166
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,100
um it's a fine rule until you get a job

167
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,419
and then you have to give your employer

168
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,560
social

169
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,639
um then maybe you open a bank account

170
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,380
and you probably need it for that so now

171
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,419
we have an exception to the rule but

172
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,680
then at some point maybe you'll get a

173
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,000
phone call and that phone call will say

174
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
I'm your bank

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,780
um give me your Social Security number

176
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,520
and that sounds like a scam right so now

177
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
we have an exception to the exception to

178
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,900
the exception and it goes on forever

179
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,280
and the point is that it's really

180
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,220
complicated and I can't Define rules and

181
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,259
I've grown up with the idea of a Social

182
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,240
Security number so it's orders of more

183
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,300
orders of magnitude more complicated

184
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,340
when you're at the same time you're

185
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,440
really really need a job

186
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,300
maybe you're still learning English and

187
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,740
you're not quite fluent enough to pick

188
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,259
up on the linguistic differences of

189
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,419
someone who's who's making a Spam call

190
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,979
or a spam email

191
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,539
and you're also navigating these

192
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,819
bureaucracies that are new to you

193
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,220
so the takeaway here

194
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,539
um the first part of the answer to this

195
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,800
question which I'm going to put in these

196
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,479
little bubbles on the right side of the

197
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:58,560
screen

198
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,479
is that geopolitical change creates

199
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,940
destabilizing conditions that cause

200
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,319
people's threat models to become

201
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,699
incomplete and that creates

202
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,940
vulnerability inherently

203
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,620
the second part of this so I'm going to

204
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,060
gray out the bubbles when I'm talking

205
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,979
but I'm not talking about them the

206
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,319
second part of this answer about the

207
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,360
connection between geological change and

208
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,520
security and privacy harms is about how

209
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,860
other needs emerge and people might

210
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,960
prioritize or de-prioritize securing

211
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
privacy

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,060
so other teachers and volunteers and

213
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,400
case managers told me that other clients

214
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,860
expressed to them that they were uneasy

215
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,900
giving out personal information even to

216
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,919
them

217
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,539
and this is a quote from a different

218
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,479
Somali woman who puts it she says it's a

219
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,039
gambling situation

220
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,599
and she's talking about how she doesn't

221
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,520
want to give her information to social

222
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
workers like case managers but she has

223
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,960
to because she needs help getting a job

224
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,220
and getting housing and applying for

225
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,120
these things

226
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
so I'm not concerned about whether her

227
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,199
threat model is correct here but she

228
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,940
can't make her actions match her threat

229
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,380
model because these other needs have

230
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,180
gotten in the way and because she's

231
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,860
forced to de-prioritize security and

232
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,139
privacy

233
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,660
so finally the third component of this

234
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,080
is about how all these design

235
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,479
misalignments add up and they become

236
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,120
systemic inequities and they exacerbate

237
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,060
other systemic inequities

238
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,300
so I think there are a lot of examples

239
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,099
um in the identity verification and

240
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,960
authentication process

241
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,020
so if you think about birthdays

242
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,958
um it's very it's fairly common in a lot

243
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,339
of places around the world for people

244
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,958
not to keep track of the day they're

245
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,700
born because it's not culturally

246
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,020
important

247
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,659
so they meant they may then come to the

248
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,120
U.S and they don't know their actual

249
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,560
birthday but they have to pick a legal

250
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,060
birthday because you need to have a

251
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,339
legal birthday here and they often pick

252
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,620
January 1st this was common amongst the

253
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,200
populations that I was working with

254
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,300
and this kind of breaks some

255
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,160
authentication processes

256
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,800
so for example I knew a guy who was from

257
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,140
Somalia and he had a very common first

258
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,120
and last name and a legal birthday of

259
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,399
January 1st and he applied to be a ride

260
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,600
share driver

261
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,279
and they did a background check using

262
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,320
only his name and birthday and it came

263
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,660
back and it said you're wanted for you

264
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,220
know violent assault 20 years ago or

265
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,740
something but he had only come to this

266
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,959
country as a refugee in 2013 so it

267
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,040
wasn't him

268
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,140
but he had no way of you know proving it

269
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,100
wasn't him

270
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,899
and it breaks in this way

271
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,820
disproportionately and it's un it's

272
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,800
disproportionately unfair for people

273
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,959
from the population where birthdays are

274
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,120
not randomly distributed like this as

275
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,459
soon as they are

276
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,080
um I think security questions are also

277
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,540
another example of where authentication

278
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,459
processes make these cultural

279
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,620
assumptions and they start to break

280
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,720
so not everybody changes their name when

281
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,040
they get married

282
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,440
um so they may not have this information

283
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,120
if you think about the question what is

284
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,220
the make and model of your first car I

285
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,399
didn't have a driver's license until I

286
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,220
had at least four email accounts so I'm

287
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,200
sure I just made up that information and

288
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,459
the point is not that like you can't

289
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,320
make information

290
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,060
but the point is that when you ask

291
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,680
somebody for information that they don't

292
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,080
have already that creates a barrier to

293
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,000
security and privacy and authentication

294
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,740
and all of those add up with other

295
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,300
barriers and they become systemic

296
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,719
inequities

297
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,220
so let me give you a few more examples

298
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,260
of how these three themes interplay in

299
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,140
three other populations and they're

300
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,600
first I'll talk about Sydney's activists

301
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
and specifically activists during the

302
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,580
revolution in 2019 and I should say that

303
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,140
I was only able to do this work because

304
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,540
of my amazing collate author Allah who

305
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,860
is from Sudan

306
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,080
and this is kind of along the same lines

307
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,060
of geopolitical change that refugees are

308
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,000
experiencing it's a destabilizing event

309
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,640
the other two populations are more along

310
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,320
the lines of natural disasters so it's

311
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,700
something where there's a lot of policy

312
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,120
shift and government intervention so the

313
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,820
first is people during kind of us the

314
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,880
whole world during the start of covid

315
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,440
and when there is this talk about

316
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,120
exposure notification absence question

317
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,459
of are you going to use one and the

318
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,959
final population is people who are

319
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,979
affected by hurricanes

320
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,600
so to begin with the first two themes

321
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
together

322
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
um Sudanese activists face this changing

323
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,480
set of adversaries they they was first

324
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,760
the dictator and then they over the over

325
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,860
the dictator was overthrown in a

326
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,940
military coup then there was the

327
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,680
military the police were always an

328
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,200
adversary and they never were completely

329
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,959
sure who their adversary was what their

330
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,420
capabilities were and what they were

331
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,620
willing to do

332
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,660
so we heard about they developed a lot

333
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,779
of strategies to deal with all this

334
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,160
um and one strategy that was very common

335
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,100
was manually deleting text messages uh

336
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,200
like just text and WhatsApp messages

337
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,240
because one threat that we heard about

338
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,120
was this if they go to a protest and

339
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,440
they get arrested the police will take

340
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,880
their phone and look through it and they

341
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,899
don't want to be found out as an

342
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,459
activist

343
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:01,260
and you might be thinking why didn't

344
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,320
they use signal or telegram or one of

345
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,959
the apps that does this automatically

346
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,459
and the answer is that the people who

347
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,700
were using telegram already did use this

348
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,380
feature

349
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,360
um but not not that many people were

350
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,880
already using Telegram and almost nobody

351
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,160
was using signal and it turns out that

352
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,779
if I download signal but none of my

353
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,519
friends do it actually doesn't matter

354
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,320
because I still can't text them so

355
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,700
there's this problem of group adoption

356
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,579
and they solved it by not trying to

357
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,740
force everyone to use the same app but

358
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,779
by instead implementing this regimented

359
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,700
approach to deleting messages

360
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,620
um so they kind of they may do with what

361
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,079
they had and it worked out for them

362
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,480
but there is this environment of

363
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,459
uncertainty about everything and about

364
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,440
all the threats they are facing so they

365
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,700
did what they could with the technology

366
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,160
they had

367
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,399
uh and moving on to covid which was also

368
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,639
a time of a change in Risk to physical

369
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,459
safety in a very different way

370
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,160
um we ran a bunch of surveys right when

371
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,899
there was uh the you know things were

372
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,279
shutting down and there was this talk

373
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,620
about explosion notification apps

374
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,899
and we wanted to know you know would you

375
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,220
use this app you know in what

376
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,959
circumstances and we found that people

377
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,000
had a lot of misconceptions about how

378
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,279
the apps worked and a lot of concerns

379
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,040
about data use and data misuse and

380
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,620
specifically location tracking and a lot

381
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,639
of people who are concerned about

382
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,740
location tracking were actually from

383
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,420
places where the apps they would be

384
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,100
using wouldn't be tracking their

385
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,540
locations

386
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,600
and but they a lot of people directly

387
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,120
compared uh to paraphrase a little bit

388
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,940
if they downloaded the app they would be

389
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,920
they would receive like health benefits

390
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,540
or benefits to their Community but if

391
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,639
they didn't download the app they would

392
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,339
be preserving their digital safety and

393
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,959
they directly contrasted these two and

394
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,579
prioritized one or the other

395
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,380
and without making any sort of judgment

396
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,600
on what the right call is because

397
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,399
everyone's situation is their own

398
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,620
context they have to be the judge for

399
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,820
themselves

400
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,040
people were making this decision off of

401
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,079
incomplete and sometimes inaccurate

402
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,639
information despite the information

403
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,920
actually being out there it just wasn't

404
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,660
making its way to the end users

405
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,399
and finally this environment of

406
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,680
incomplete information also happens

407
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,959
after hurricanes

408
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,399
um so for example

409
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,139
there's often a lot of physical damage

410
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,940
to a community so the power can go out

411
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,320
cell towers can be damaged or destroyed

412
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,700
roads and other infrastructure can be

413
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,440
damaged and

414
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,180
you don't know how long it's going to be

415
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,800
out for and people Express to us in

416
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,180
surveys that

417
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,699
they were often choosing between well do

418
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,620
I use my phone now do I use my phone and

419
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,720
computer to check in on my friends use

420
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,279
social media look at what's going on in

421
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,860
my community see if people need help or

422
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,660
do I preserve the battery in case I have

423
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,699
an emergency and I have to call 9-1-1 or

424
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:54,540
something

425
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,980
and

426
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,360
everyone makes this choice for

427
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,680
themselves again there's no way to know

428
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,139
but there's this environment of

429
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,600
incomplete information because nobody

430
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,860
knows how long the power is going to be

431
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,519
out

432
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,620
and it really affects the way they use

433
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,199
technology and the things they're able

434
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:11,459
to get from it and the needs they're

435
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,740
able to fulfill

436
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,720
so in these three examples

437
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,100
um we can see that people experience

438
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,260
changes that affect their access to

439
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,880
technology and their ability to use it

440
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,899
normally

441
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,720
the threats that to their to safety

442
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,100
and the things that they have to keep

443
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,360
safe the assets that could be

444
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,680
information or it could be something

445
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,139
physical or it could be something else

446
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,940
and a counterpart to this is about

447
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,860
prioritization everybody here was

448
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,779
changing how they prioritize security

449
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:39,560
and privacy

450
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,120
so moving on to this third theme about

451
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,480
design misalignments there are just so

452
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,820
many design misalignments things little

453
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,740
designs and Technologies or big designs

454
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,079
that didn't work for certain populations

455
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,899
and they made it more difficult for them

456
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,120
um I my favorite example is something

457
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
that Twitter did during the Sydney's

458
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,139
Revolution so they turned on two-factor

459
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,399
for everybody

460
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,760
and the problem was that Sudan had been

461
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,380
under International sanctions for many

462
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,779
years at that point and Sudanese users

463
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,000
couldn't add their phone numbers and yet

464
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,260
the activists still needed to use

465
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,579
Twitter because they used it to connect

466
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,839
to other activists through direct

467
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
messages they were organizing they were

468
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,260
getting out the word about protests so

469
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,180
it was a really important tool for them

470
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,000
so they developed a couple workarounds

471
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,740
um sometimes people asked friends and

472
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,420
family who were abroad to add their own

473
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,740
phone numbers and then they would kind

474
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,260
of do a little manual two-factor

475
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,480
um via whatever Channel they wanted

476
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,820
sometimes they were able to get a global

477
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,940
SIM card so they would appear they would

478
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,560
have an international phone number but

479
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,360
they would still be in Sudan not

480
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,920
everyone was able to do this

481
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
and

482
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,040
one thing that's interesting about this

483
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,420
is that these could have actually

484
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,279
increased their security and privacy if

485
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,660
their two-factor codes weren't going

486
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,759
through the Telecom Network in like the

487
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,899
typical way

488
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,519
but I don't think that was Twitter's

489
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,839
intention

490
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,220
um and that's kind of the point that

491
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,079
Twitter made this design decision

492
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,639
and I think interestingly it's kind of

493
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,760
like a generally good all-purpose

494
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,199
security thing that we like to say is

495
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,480
turn on two-factor but it had these

496
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,579
consequences here it had cascading

497
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,040
consequences for a group of people who

498
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,140
were already vulnerable and facing a lot

499
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,980
of change in their lives

500
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,619
so to wrap up

501
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,220
um

502
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,780
what like where do we go from here

503
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,020
because change is constant change is not

504
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,120
bad uh it's good it's often necessary

505
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,919
and

506
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,720
I think the question is how do we design

507
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,460
for people who are experiencing change

508
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,740
and how do we design for the people who

509
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,080
are made vulnerable by change

510
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,299
and one reason that I think it's helpful

511
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,160
to talk about multiple populations at

512
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,740
once is that you can see that one design

513
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,020
isn't going to fit everyone it's not one

514
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,280
tool is not going to work for everyone

515
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,679
and even if there are some surface

516
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,240
similarities their threat models are all

517
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,220
so different that how do you design

518
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,020
something that fits everybody's threat

519
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,960
model I think it's really hard but I

520
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,520
think it's worth examining multiple

521
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,960
populations at once so you don't design

522
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,760
something for one population that hurts

523
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,679
another population

524
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,860
so I think the geopolitical change can

525
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,660
sort of be a lens through which to think

526
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,240
about some pieces of vulnerability

527
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,740
and

528
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,240
I think there are these three questions

529
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,280
to ask like when you think about people

530
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,620
who you're designing for

531
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,460
some of them are going to be

532
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,440
experiencing geopolitical change

533
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,539
in many different ways

534
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,280
um how is their threat model going to be

535
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,740
going to become incomplete and how can

536
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,320
you best support that maybe you can give

537
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,660
them options maybe you can support that

538
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,000
technically maybe you can detect that

539
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,380
they've gone through a change maybe it's

540
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,179
a bad idea to try to detect they've gone

541
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,320
through a change I think it's probably

542
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,140
different for a lot of populations

543
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,059
uh but it's it's something that we need

544
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,100
to think about when we design

545
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,500
another thing to think about is uh needs

546
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,120
other than security and privacy and how

547
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,980
people are going to prioritize security

548
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,860
and privacy not in a vacuum so if people

549
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,780
are going to prioritize it

550
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,100
um do they have the tools to do that

551
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,720
safely are you giving them the tools to

552
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,220
do that safely and in a way that is

553
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,860
usable and safe to them and if they're

554
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,080
de-prioritizing it is that really

555
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,299
necessary can we design in a way so they

556
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,700
don't have to de-prioritize it

557
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,100
uh and then finally

558
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,860
I think thinking about systemic inequity

559
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,679
and the way that uh design misalignments

560
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,299
contribute to that and the way that

561
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,740
they're

562
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,100
they're distributed unfairly

563
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
um I think we need to think about things

564
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,059
other than technology to tackle systemic

565
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,260
inequities

566
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,660
um and then think about you know ways

567
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,820
through design that we can counteract

568
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,960
some systemic inequities

569
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,500
um there are also other reasons for

570
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,020
vulnerability but I

571
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,820
that are not related to geopolitical

572
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,799
change but I think this is one that

573
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,360
encompasses a lot of change that people

574
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,760
are going through today

575
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,900
um and I hope that this can help us

576
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,940
design something safer

577
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,980
thank you that's all I have and I would

578
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,160
love to take questions

579
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,359
