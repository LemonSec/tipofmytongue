1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,599
hello everyone thank you so much for

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,160
having me here

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,140
um my name is Eric Zhang I'm a postdoc

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,060
at Carnegie Mellon University where I

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,340
study usable security and privacy and

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,519
web measurement and so today I will be

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,260
talking about some research that I did

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,939
during my PhD at the University of

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,439
Washington

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,120
um I guess diving into the heart of this

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,980
dumpster fire

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,020
um and on characterizing and measuring

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,820
misleading harmful online ads at scale

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,920
so uh like it or not online advertising

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,660
is a fundamental part of the web as we

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,520
know it so many websites need the

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,140
revenue from ads to make their content

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,600
and services free for users and other

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,879
businesses uh they depend on these

21
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,860
online ads to promote their products and

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,160
services

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,719
to a website nothing's more off-putting

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,420
to me when uh when I see ads that are

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,040
misleading harmful or otherwise

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,740
unpleasant so for example in these red

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,380
boxes like these clickbait ads that look

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,979
vaguely like scams or download ads that

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,080
are trying to click me or trick me into

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
clicking on them

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,799
and so for a lack of a better term I'll

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,080
be calling these bad ads

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,780
and so bad ads commonly use misleading

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,400
techniques to trick people into clicking

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,080
on them such as clickbait headlines

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,479
shocking images and deceptive formatting

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,600
and these ads can lead to real harms for

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,659
example in 2021 according to the FTC

39
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,119
consumers reported that they lost 96

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,579
million dollars to scams via online ads

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,820
and pop-ups and ads can also be used as

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,079
a vector to spread things like

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,960
ransomware malware and adware

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,820
however we have very little

45
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,340
understanding of this phenomenon of bad

46
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,500
ads because you know currently there's

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,240
not very much transparency from the

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,220
online advertising industry so we really

49
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,720
just don't have a complete picture of

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,040
this landscape

51
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,320
and additionally what academic work has

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,140
been done on online ads like the past 10

53
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,598
years mostly focuses on topics like

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,840
privacy and web tracking so to shine a

55
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,280
light on what's going on in this

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,200
ecosystem in this talk I'll be providing

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,760
a brief sample of some of the research

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,640
I've been working on during my PhD to

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,260
systematize our knowledge on bad ads

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,760
from both the qualitative and a

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,980
quantitative perspective

62
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,400
and so I'll be answering this uh I'll be

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,020
answering four questions

64
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,360
um today so first what makes a bad ad in

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,459
the first place how prevalent are bad

66
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,340
ads what enables bad ads and what can we

67
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,959
do about them

68
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,819
and so we'll start with what makes a bad

69
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,920
ad in the first place

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,860
so all right

71
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,120
definitions how do we how do we define

72
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,580
this word bad I keep banding around

73
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,920
where do we draw the line between what's

74
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,680
acceptable and what should be prohibited

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,660
and so

76
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,220
um on the left if we have just you know

77
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,200
regular products and services that we

78
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
might think are okay on the right

79
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,400
um we're thinking about you know what's

80
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,680
we have like two ways where we to think

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,239
about you know what's prohibited so for

82
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,000
example there's things that are illegal

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,980
or violate regulations like false

84
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,800
advertising or ads like uh

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,019
discriminatory racially discriminatory

86
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,540
employment ads and so these are just uh

87
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,540
not permitted by like the FTC

88
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,180
um another is content policy so what the

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,980
advertising companies themselves decide

90
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,959
are not okay to put on their platforms

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,640
and so this can include things like hate

92
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,120
speech or explicit images

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,340
um but let's let's just assume that for

94
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,500
the most part regulators and content

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,260
moderators are kind of doing their jobs

96
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,659
so what's we still have this gray area

97
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,440
of stuff that just seems bad and uh it

98
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
doesn't technically violate any policies

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,220
but it's still appearing on the web and

100
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,440
harming people's experience so you know

101
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
what so so in this this part of the talk

102
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,819
I'll kind of try to talk about you know

103
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,040
what is actually in this gray area how

104
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,680
do we Define it and so our approach was

105
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,200
to look at what what do people actually

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,879
dislike about these ads rather than

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
relying on regular what regulators and

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,540
platforms say

109
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,060
and so to try to investigate that we

110
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,040
broke this into a few research questions

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,260
so first you know what are the reasons

112
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,280
why people uh dislike ads and then what

113
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,960
is the content of those ads that people

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,960
dislike and then lastly how how does

115
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
people's attitudes towards these ads

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,500
affect how they use the web

117
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,380
and so uh to answer these questions we

118
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,120
conducted a systematic qualitative

119
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,780
survey actually two surveys in the first

120
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,500
we uh first wanted to just ask you know

121
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,780
why why do you why do people dislike ads

122
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,880
and so we ran a survey with 60 people

123
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,580
showing them 30 ads and just asked them

124
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,800
to write down you know why do you like

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,840
this why do you not like this and we use

126
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,940
that to create a taxonomy of reasons for

127
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,580
liking and disliking ads

128
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,100
and then second we wanted to find out

129
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,900
what kinds of AD content were associated

130
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,240
with that taxonomy so for example what

131
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,860
kind of products are common in ads that

132
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,139
people find deceptive and so to answer

133
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,880
these questions we conducted a large

134
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,860
labeling survey where we had a thousand

135
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,320
participants label a set of 500 ads

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,780
using that taxonomy

137
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,419
all right so so what did we find

138
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,400
um based on the qualitative part of the

139
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,020
survey we identified nine distinct

140
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,780
reasons why people dislike ads so as you

141
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
might expect people often dislike ads

142
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,560
that are boring not relevant to them or

143
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,300
unclear

144
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,699
people also dislike poorly designed and

145
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,560
ugly ads ads that promote products that

146
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,900
they don't like politicized ads and ads

147
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,460
that are offensive uncomfortable or

148
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,320
distasteful

149
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,240
and then lastly people tend to dislike

150
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,039
ads that try to mislead them so they

151
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,560
dislike the use of Click bait tactics uh

152
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,880
they dislike ads that appear

153
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,860
untrustworthy and ads that use a pushy

154
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,680
or manipulative tone

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
and so let's actually dive into you know

156
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,340
what kinds of ads are associated with

157
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,680
some of these parts of the taxonomy and

158
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,300
I'll look at kind of like basically the

159
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,699
two of the most negative reactions so

160
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,560
first ads that people thought that were

161
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,800
untrustworthy these commonly contained

162
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,139
ads like ads for dietary supplements

163
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,440
that make dubious Health claims or ads

164
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,120
for software downloads that are trying

165
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,240
to disguise themselves as uh as part of

166
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,060
the page that they appear on or ads for

167
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,680
things like investment advice that

168
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,720
promise these big huge returns

169
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,479
um

170
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,400
another category of ads that people

171
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,199
really disliked were ads that they

172
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,380
perceived as distasteful and so

173
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,940
um there's a variety of stuff in here

174
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,740
including things like content Farms so

175
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,539
these are like you know celebrity news

176
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,419
or like listicles and these are kind of

177
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,220
like ads for Content websites that try

178
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,960
to maximize their page views and AD

179
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,000
Revenue with low quality but attention

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,340
grabbing headlines and articles

181
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,919
and then oftentimes these content forms

182
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,380
contains various suggestive or explicit

183
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,880
images

184
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,840
um

185
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,300
and then in a different category there's

186
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,160
these health related and supplement ads

187
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,620
where uh they tend to use gross images

188
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,319
again to try to uh to catch people's

189
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,620
attention

190
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,460
however there are types of ads that

191
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,440
people do like seeing so typically these

192
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,240
are well designed and simple ads for

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,440
things that people are genuinely

194
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,780
interested in from familiar Brands and

195
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,460
so these cover a range of different

196
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,199
things like consumer products streaming

197
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:25,979
services

198
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,159
Etc

199
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,539
um lastly in this survey we also

200
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,580
investigated how people's views of ads

201
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,199
were related to their ad blocker usage

202
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,780
and so this chart here shows people's

203
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,000
overall attitude towards online ads and

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,860
whether they use an ad blocker as you

205
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,599
can kind of see people who generally

206
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,819
dislike ads tend to use ad blockers more

207
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,460
and so it kind of suggests if we let the

208
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,139
quality of ads go unchecked it'll drive

209
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,819
people to more ad avoiding behaviors

210
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,800
like installing ad blockers or moving to

211
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,580
different platforms

212
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
all right so now that we've sort of

213
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,360
qualitatively uh had a look at what bad

214
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
ads are now let's think more

215
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,960
quantitatively about how prevalent these

216
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,240
are on the web and so you know this is

217
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,460
kind of a big big question the web is

218
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,319
very big and so

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,060
um what we ended up doing in this study

220
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,560
is we looked at a case study of news

221
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,460
websites so anecdotally we uh when we

222
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,139
started this project I noticed you know

223
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,300
there's a lot of uh crappy looking ads

224
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,699
on on news websites in particular at the

225
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,900
time we were looking at fake news

226
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,960
websites um this is sort of post 2016

227
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,300
and this is a big deal and we notice you

228
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,919
know there's some really egregiously bad

229
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,500
content appearing in the ads there and

230
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,958
so we wanted to find we wanted to look

231
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,719
at this category of sites in particular

232
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,700
and we came up with a few questions to

233
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,520
try to study so first you know what kind

234
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,800
of ads what categories the bad ads are

235
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
most common on news websites and do they

236
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,140
appear more on just the quality of the

237
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,180
website actually impact the types of ads

238
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,640
that you see and so do we want to find

239
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,200
out do mainstream news websites have

240
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,180
more bad ads than fake news websites or

241
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,880
vice versa and then lastly what ad

242
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,740
networks were actually responsible for

243
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,620
making these bad ads serving these bad

244
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,180
ads on the page

245
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,519
and so to answer these research

246
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
questions we conducted a measurement

247
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,500
study where first we generated a list of

248
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,660
mainstream and fake news websites using

249
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,279
a combination of things like the Alexa

250
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,740
top 1 million and aggregating a bunch of

251
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,959
data from fact checkers

252
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,000
and then we built a web crawler that

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
would visit all of the pages in our

254
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,540
lists and then scrape all the ads that

255
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,600
they encountered and then we ended up

256
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,180
with a data set of

257
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,620
2419 ads that we ended that we

258
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,839
qualitatively coded either putting it

259
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,540
into uh two categories benign or

260
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,640
problematic and then we would uh break

261
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,620
down the problematic ads a little deeper

262
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,019
and so I'll show you I'll show you that

263
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,220
up next

264
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,300
um so

265
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,820
what starting with what the most common

266
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,399
categories of bad ads we saw so in this

267
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,920
chart each bar represents one of the

268
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,320
categories of problematic ads as a

269
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,820
percentage of all the ads we labeled in

270
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,279
the data set and so the top three that

271
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,500
we saw were content Farms like we

272
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,899
discussed earlier at 11.7 percent of ads

273
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,680
on all news websites ads for dietary

274
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
supplements at 10.6 percent of ads and

275
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,040
um and sponsored search ads at 8.1

276
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,779
percent and so sponsored search is sort

277
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,600
of a form of affiliate marketing

278
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,220
Arbitrage where they're using clickbait

279
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,380
tactics to try to Market other companies

280
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,940
products

281
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,380
um

282
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,860
so next how prevalent were these bad ads

283
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,260
on mainstream versus fake news websites

284
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,959
so in this chart we have the percentage

285
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,459
of ads on news websites that were

286
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:43,860
labeled as problematic with mainstream

287
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,839
news sites on the left fake news on the

288
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,000
right and then the home pages of the

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,339
sites in green and the article pages in

290
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,620
blue and so what we found is that over

291
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,200
half the ads on the articles of both

292
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
categories of websites were in the

293
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,480
problematic group and so kind of the

294
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,100
takeaways that you know it's not just

295
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,740
the low quality fake news websites that

296
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,440
were willing to run bad ads and harm the

297
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,940
reputation of sites but you know

298
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,040
mainstream news sites like you know USA

299
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,140
Today Washington Post they're they're

300
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,959
engaging in some of this uh in in

301
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,979
running these ads as well

302
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,560
um so another thing uh next we want to

303
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,779
look at you know where which kinds of AD

304
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,760
networks were responsible for serving

305
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,220
these ads and so on news websites in

306
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,140
particular we noticed that there's two

307
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,779
distinct types of ads so

308
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,820
um this the standard type of ad that you

309
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,440
would see are called display ads and so

310
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,839
these are just the boxes or banners that

311
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,839
you'd see above or within an article and

312
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,060
many ad networks serve these types of

313
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,800
ads including you know Google AdSense

314
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,920
and and most of the popular ones but

315
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,660
then particularly on news sites there's

316
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,420
this format of AD called native ads and

317
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,040
so they usually see these at the bottom

318
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,320
they're side of Articles and they're in

319
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,300
the section labeled sponsored content or

320
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,399
around the web and they're specifically

321
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,800
designed by the ad Network to imitate

322
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,839
the look and feel of news article

323
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,260
recommendations and so they're kind of

324
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,820
the inherent in the format they're using

325
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,940
this deceptive formatting and so um and

326
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,680
there's a few specific ad networks that

327
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,399
just that engage in this including taboo

328
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,019
outright and rev content

329
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,820
and

330
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,860
what we found is that these native ads

331
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,839
overwhelmingly contained the bad ads in

332
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
our data sets so nearly 87 percent of

333
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,339
the ads of the Native ads that we

334
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,959
labeled were in one of the problematic

335
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,540
categories complaint compared to only 17

336
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,120
of the display ads that we labeled

337
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,040
and so the most prevalent ad networks

338
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,959
that serve these ads were tabula

339
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,779
outbrain and rev content and so really

340
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,220
we're seeing that you know these

341
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,260
specific ad networks are responsible for

342
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,880
a lot of the misleading and harmful

343
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,639
content that we see On Any Given News

344
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,060
website

345
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,399
all right so now that we've had a taste

346
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,100
of you know how how prevalent these ads

347
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,660
are across the web

348
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,700
um now I'll dive into a little deeper

349
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,560
into you know what is happening in the

350
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,019
ecosystem that's enabling this

351
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,240
um and so the short answer is there's

352
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,459
not really one single gatekeeper on the

353
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,139
web when it comes to to online

354
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,240
advertising and that causes problems and

355
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,040
so to explain I need to get into this

356
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,139
complicated distributed supply chain

357
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,600
that underpins advertising on the web

358
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,660
so when you are a website and you want

359
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,360
to run ads on your site you'll usually

360
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,339
work with a company called a supply side

361
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,500
platform and so they will basically

362
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,240
handle like you put our iframe on the

363
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,240
page and we will give you ads

364
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,220
um and when you're an Advertiser and you

365
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,839
want to buy ads you want to run them on

366
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,060
the web you will go through a company

367
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,160
called a demand side platform where you

368
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,779
will say I want to buy ads and I want to

369
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,160
Target at these people

370
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,360
and then to actually link these two up

371
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,120
um whenever you've a user visits a web

372
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,000
page and an ad needs to be loaded the

373
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
supply side platform will uh initiate an

374
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,860
uh request for an ad auction at an ad

375
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,860
exchange and so it'll basically link up

376
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,079
um the ad exchange will then solicit

377
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,300
bids from various demand side providers

378
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,579
and figure out who's who's going to bid

379
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,139
the most and then who's going to

380
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,360
actually run the ad on that page

381
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,079
and so the what this means is that so

382
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,519
there isn't just one centralized

383
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,079
platform that is uh vertically

384
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,579
integrating all these components like

385
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,980
like you might see on Facebook and so

386
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,839
that means it's common on the web for

387
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,519
several different ad tech companies to

388
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,200
be involved in serving the ads so

389
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,120
websites can choose from multiple

390
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,600
different ssps supply side platforms

391
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,000
advertisers or can run their ads through

392
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,779
any number of demand side providers and

393
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,100
importantly each can have their own

394
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,519
content policies and standards

395
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,000
and so that leads to a situation where

396
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,440
the responsibility for Content

397
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,019
moderation in ads is distributed across

398
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,600
a bunch of different entities and so you

399
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,000
know and that means there's also space

400
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,920
for Bad actors to exist so there might

401
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,019
be some ad platforms like the native ads

402
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,779
networks that we uh talked about who

403
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,399
have less stringent standards for

404
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,800
Content than others and similarly there

405
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,500
may be websites that are okay with

406
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,779
running lower quality ads because maybe

407
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,820
they pay well or they need to fill space

408
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,639
and so all of that just creates a space

409
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,639
for bad ads and you know dishonest

410
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,019
advertisers to to to run their ads

411
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,480
and so maybe just to bring this whole

412
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,519
story together

413
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,560
um we so uh basically we we found this

414
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,300
there's this gray area of bad ads that

415
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,579
people you know don't don't like to see

416
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,680
but they don't explicitly violate any

417
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,320
laws or policies at the moment and

418
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,120
they're quite prevalent across the web

419
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,000
including on reputable news websites

420
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,639
and part of the reason why this occurs

421
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,399
is that this distributed nature of the

422
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,920
web advertising ecosystem and just the

423
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,600
incentives for websites and advertisers

424
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,339
creates a space for these bad ads to

425
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,339
exist and so you know I think this is a

426
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,480
problem for the web because you know

427
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,579
it's going to harm people's trust in

428
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,740
websites harm people's trust in online

429
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,019
ads and it'll drive people to do things

430
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,300
like install ad blockers or move to

431
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,959
other platforms like social media or on

432
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,220
mobile where

433
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,660
um and that kind of threatens the

434
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,959
overall health of the web platform

435
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,540
all right so what can we do about all of

436
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,500
this

437
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,260
um I have a few maybe pipe dream

438
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,779
academic suggestions but uh you know

439
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,660
from the Ivory Tower but um I think you

440
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,740
know

441
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,079
uh the incremental approach maybe is to

442
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,880
try to build additional user trust in

443
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,800
the web so from the ad tech industry

444
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,380
there's a lot that could be done they

445
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,120
could adopt more user-centric content

446
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
policies that Hue a little more closely

447
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,880
to what people actually find uh find

448
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,100
distasteful misleading or uncomfortable

449
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,600
about ads on the web

450
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,820
there could be more coordination between

451
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,679
the different ad platforms across the

452
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,959
web to try to maintain higher standards

453
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,500
for content and you know as researchers

454
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,179
we always love if they would provide

455
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,179
more transparency so that we can uh we

456
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,859
can perform audits on the content of the

457
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,780
ads on how they're being targeted how

458
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,500
they're being tracked

459
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,000
um you know and browsers may have a role

460
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,280
to play in this too so um they could

461
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,980
help in the enforcement of these ads uh

462
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,540
standards for ad quality in the browser

463
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,280
so you know for example we are we

464
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,780
already know that Chrome

465
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,900
um uh has will block ads that you know

466
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,419
uh use too many CPU resources and things

467
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,100
like that so maybe they could look into

468
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,020
doing something like this for content

469
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,880
and not just performance

470
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,100
and then lastly you know Regulators also

471
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,679
have a role mainly in just strengthening

472
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,480
enforcement against uh just some of the

473
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,039
deceptive techniques that online

474
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,200
advertisers use such as again this

475
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
native advertising phenomenon

476
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
um

477
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,440
and then of course I can't go without

478
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,820
mentioning you know we could also try to

479
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,260
address the structural factors here

480
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,900
which is and uh this is even more of a

481
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,460
pipe dream but you know if we were to

482
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,440
reconsider the revenue model for the web

483
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,720
and online advertising entirely now that

484
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,299
could reduce the incentives for uh these

485
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,419
bad ads to run and the incentives for uh

486
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,980
websites to compromise on people's

487
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,620
privacy but of course that is a enormous

488
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,480
lift

489
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,500
um

490
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,539
and lastly I'll just close with a few

491
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,179
more uh interesting topics on this on

492
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,200
the research side because I think

493
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,700
there's a lot more to look into that ads

494
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,039
than uh what I what I presented today

495
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,679
and so in particular I'm interested in

496
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,480
you know whether bad ads are being used

497
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,360
in sensitive contexts and whether

498
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,860
vulnerable populations may be targeted

499
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,100
by uh bad ads and so

500
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,960
um so previously we did some work

501
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
actually on political ads during the

502
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,520
2020 elections and we found all these

503
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,320
examples of misleading political ads

504
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,760
from campaigns and from other

505
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,520
organizations and one of the things we

506
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,900
found is that they were heavily targeted

507
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,320
at more partisan news websites and so

508
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,059
um we see some of these techniques

509
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,500
seeping into the political side of

510
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,299
things

511
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,860
um another interesting angle is you know

512
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,200
how are how are misleading ads being

513
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,580
targeted at people who might be

514
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,320
vulnerable to those types of deceptions

515
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,539
and so uh one thing we're looking at

516
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,179
right now is whether health related ads

517
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,799
are targeted at people with health

518
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,780
conditions so

519
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,700
um and so people who might be suffering

520
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,960
from these health conditions might be

521
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,240
particularly susceptible to you know

522
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,640
certain deceptions relating to false

523
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,340
Health claims or or cure-all supplements

524
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,799
and things like this and

525
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,179
um you know there's also the aspect

526
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,160
where you know protected health

527
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,919
information might be inferred by by the

528
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,440
advertising uh by the advertising

529
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,299
ecosystem and use to Target people in

530
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,039
this way and so basically we're trying

531
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,140
to find evidence that this might be

532
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,500
happening

533
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,460
um and with that thank you all so much

534
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,020
for listening to my talk

535
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,640
um this was the work that I presented

536
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,960
was a team effort from a bunch of

537
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,039
researchers from the University of

538
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,360
Washington

539
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,440
um and I couldn't have done this at

540
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,059
their help

541
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,580
um yeah thank you so much and I'm open

542
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,659
for questions thank you
