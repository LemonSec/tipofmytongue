1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,480
so if you don't know these folks you're

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,460
going to in a couple of minutes but

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,500
these are some of the best

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,260
um security and privacy related

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,939
journalists that I have worked with

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,900
um in my career and I invited them to

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,399
um to Enigma this year because we wanted

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,280
to have a conversation about how cyber

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,200
crime and other types of

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,760
um like security incidents and things

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,620
get covered kind of like the behind the

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,960
scenes of like how does this happen from

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,540
like The Newsroom perspective how do

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,760
reporters think about how to cover

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,980
certain things

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,640
um and so I'm also like a this is

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,160
terrible but I am a uh True Crime

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,219
Podcast Addict so I was like how can I

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,559
bring True Crime to Enigma

21
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,140
um and so this is the the incantation of

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,459
that so

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,080
um I'm gonna ask each of them to

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,000
introduce themselves

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,920
um and then uh we will start the

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,979
discussion um please post questions in

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,200
slack if you have them

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
um we'll ask those at the end or of

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,920
course you can use the mics in the room

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,479
as well

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,520
um but very rarely will you get the

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,960
opportunity to ask these folks questions

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,520
because you all work for companies with

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,900
PR teams

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,960
um except for Leah who's at fun employed

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,460
at the moment

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,600
um

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
so please please make use of this

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,920
opportunity so we'll start uh on my left

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,740
and then uh move to the end cool hi I'm

41
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,860
Alfred uh I'm a privacy reporter at

42
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,320
Politico prior to that I was also a

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,619
privacy reporter at the markup and uh I

44
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,740
covered cyber security and privacy for

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,939
uh CNET from 2016 to 2020 before we were

46
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,258
replaced by AI so

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,079
or you are AI right now in front of us

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,840
um I'm Lily Hayne Newman I'm a security

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,400
and privacy reporter at wired and I used

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,840
to be a general interest Tech reporter

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,860
at slate uh and yeah I have not yet been

52
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,300
replaced by AI to my knowledge

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm Joe Mann

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,340
um I started covering tech security in

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,879
1999

56
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,300
and I'm now at the Washington Post I

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,760
extends at the LA Times and the

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,020
financial times and then Reuters

59
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,180
and you know sometimes I write books so

60
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,680
I did one about

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,260
the Russian government uh being in

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,640
cahoots with organized cyber crime

63
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,440
called fatal system error

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
um and then more recently I wrote a book

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,300
called uh called the dead cow

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,280
so I want to start just with a little

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,780
bit of context for everybody because

68
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,660
you've all kind of covered cyber crime

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,040
in a little bit of a different way in

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,420
terms of the different players and

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,060
perspectives and the lens that you even

72
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,379
if you're covering the same incident

73
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,340
you were looking at it from different

74
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,200
Vantage points because you're focusing

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,900
on different like stakeholders within

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,900
that scenario so I want to ask how do

77
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,180
you decide which perspective to cover

78
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,879
right whether it's like victims the the

79
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,900
attackers the investigators and can you

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,180
actually can you ever cover them all

81
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,920
within the same story

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,180
yeah

83
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,220
um so a lot of my coverage was very much

84
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,060
focused on victims of cyber crime so

85
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,620
ransomware was a big deal I think it

86
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,420
still is but

87
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,400
um it was you know really creeping up

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,659
around the time that I was covering

89
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,819
cyber security so I was reaching out to

90
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,379
school as I was reaching out to you know

91
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,420
Folks at hospitals about how is this

92
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,940
impacting you um I think for me that was

93
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,379
just more important and I think it

94
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,019
mattered a lot more for our audiences

95
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,340
um because CNET was like a very like

96
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,860
General news Tech website so it made a

97
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,260
lot more sense for me to show the the

98
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,480
harms of cyber crime more than you know

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,000
what the how did this this like attack

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,560
happen or what vulnerability did they

101
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,019
get in on I think it was more valuable

102
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,760
for our readers to show you know here

103
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,040
here's the impact of like these kinds of

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
attacks

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,060
yeah I think it's a really interesting

106
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,100
question especially like can you do it

107
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,820
all in one story I I would say similarly

108
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,699
um wired we often

109
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,240
attempt to really focus on victims but

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,460
it can be really hard right like victims

111
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,620
all right this is you know something we

112
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,000
know about uh cyber crime and just sort

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,479
of uh security incidents in general or

114
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,460
security findings in general uh

115
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,139
vulnerability findings all types of

116
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,120
disclosure like people don't want to

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
talk about it and come forward and they

118
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,380
don't want to be on the record so

119
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,759
anytime they can avoid that they do so

120
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,400
that actually

121
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,900
makes it challenging I think sometimes

122
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,759
it can feel like well the perspective of

123
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,639
victims and the real human toll of some

124
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,520
of these things isn't being told enough

125
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,699
or isn't being heard enough but there is

126
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,139
a tension there where it can be really

127
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,240
hard to get that stuff on the record but

128
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,660
yeah we we that's a huge Focus for us

129
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,600
and but then I think a lot of other

130
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,160
perspectives like wired is always trying

131
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,940
to cover are kind of the the interesting

132
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,280
technical nuances as well of how things

133
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,060
happen and the sequence of events so

134
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,520
maybe that brings in a bunch of the

135
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
different perspectives but it's pretty

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
hard to hit everything in one story

137
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,520
especially like a tight news story

138
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,340
um

139
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,539
my hidden agenda is to try to educate

140
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:57,360
people about important complicated stuff

141
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,500
and write it in plain words that regular

142
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,960
folks would actually care about and see

143
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,580
why it's important and by regular folks

144
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm including members of Congress most

145
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
of whom do not have engineering degrees

146
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,180
though that's improving the Holy Grail

147
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,580
though is a story where you can do the

148
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,580
whole chain from uh you know some dude

149
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,580
working in Russia

150
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,580
through his pay masters

151
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,979
to the infection to the victim but that

152
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,560
almost never happens last time I found

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,300
that perfect chain where you could

154
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,240
humanize the victims and tell say

155
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,860
explain what was happening the day they

156
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,199
got hit and the guy who's I wrote a book

157
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,759
about it so that was that was fatal

158
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,900
System error

159
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,680
um it is it is super rare I'm so I'm

160
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,500
agnostic about which pieces of the

161
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,280
puzzle I use to write a good story that

162
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,800
will bring attention to important policy

163
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,860
stuff that we have to figure out except

164
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,440
that I try not to I don't want to

165
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,100
arrowize the um the bad guys and I also

166
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,160
don't find most of them very interesting

167
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,400
I find the good guys more interesting

168
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,680
and generally the victims you know they

169
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,539
didn't do anything hideously wrong and

170
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,280
and you know the wrong place wrong time

171
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,979
and so I tend not to Spotlight them

172
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,080
either so I guess if I was gonna more

173
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,360
often than not I am focusing on the

174
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,880
investigation

175
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,860
and uh and talking about high

176
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,319
highlighting policy issues in play when

177
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,460
relevant

178
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,220
awesome what was the uh the your

179
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,259
favorite cyber crime story that you've

180
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,599
covered so far in your career

181
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,759
um so this is going to be a bit out of

182
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,919
left field I guess but it is I promise

183
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,900
it's really fun

184
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,520
um so I had uh read about

185
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,479
um

186
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,460
if you remember Jared Fogle his

187
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,160
situation uh he he got for those who

188
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,080
don't remember okay so he was a former

189
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,440
Subway uh spokesperson turned uh oh God

190
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,720
like child predator

191
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,580
um so his situation

192
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,380
um part of the bus they had these dogs

193
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,419
like sniff out like this hidden hard

194
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,639
drive that he had which I thought was

195
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,020
kind of insane

196
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,240
um and then I found out that there was a

197
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
canine training academy like two hours

198
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,580
away from where I work so I went to this

199
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,680
Academy and like I followed around this

200
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,419
dog like training procedure that they

201
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,860
have for dogs like to sniff out

202
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,620
Electronics specifically

203
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,020
um which is pretty cool I I got to spend

204
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,879
like the whole day with like a bunch of

205
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,440
dogs and it

206
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,659
cyber crime adjacent so

207
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,929
wow that rules

208
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,958
[Laughter]

209
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,200
um mine isn't fun at all okay

210
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,480
um I was just gonna say we have been

211
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,060
talking about this question and like I

212
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,779
think favorite is maybe not the word I

213
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,120
would use because this story is it's

214
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,940
hard to think of one

215
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,800
um I mean maybe like you were saying you

216
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,120
know one where you have the whole chain

217
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
and you can make it into an amazing

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
narrative in a book would be like a

219
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,000
favorite but typically these are stories

220
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,160
that are really painful to report or

221
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,339
like you know really sucks to see the

222
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,040
toll and just see the sort of moral

223
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,100
bankruptcy of the actors and

224
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,200
um but I I was just going to say that in

225
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,760
general like the the story line that I

226
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,019
feel like strongly about covering is

227
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,519
business email compromise where actors

228
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,839
sometimes through email compromise but

229
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,600
sometimes essentially just through like

230
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,459
extended phishing and social engineering

231
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,360
attacks trick companies into sending

232
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,260
money to pay like a a contractor that

233
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,660
doesn't really exist or you know put

234
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,160
someone on their payroll who doesn't

235
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,680
exist or something like that I'm

236
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,160
and this is like the the biggest type of

237
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,440
cyber crime in terms of losses you know

238
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,540
at least according to the complaints

239
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,700
that the FBI gets

240
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,560
um but it just doesn't get a lot of

241
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,600
coverage for I think the general

242
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,300
audience because it's uh that's kind of

243
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,160
it like that's what happens and none of

244
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,899
the companies ever want to talk about it

245
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,500
and I I think the the sort of numbers

246
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,839
that you know are reported to the far

247
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,300
way way under because companies don't

248
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,100
even want to talk about it with law

249
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,080
enforcement or anyone

250
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,440
um but it's huge and it and the same

251
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,620
concepts are used to in or it's sort of

252
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,899
enmeshed with other types of crime like

253
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,140
romance scams and now you know Pig

254
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,260
butchering which is same type of thing

255
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,399
where you're like

256
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,279
it's sort of bringing someone into this

257
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,040
web that is totally fictionalized where

258
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,140
they think they're corresponding with a

259
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,519
different person than they really are

260
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,620
and end up you know sending all their

261
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,839
money and these are all kind of on a

262
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,519
Continuum so anyway business email

263
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,480
compromise is I guess a favorite

264
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,519
uh I like

265
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,660
crimes that illustrate a new thing or an

266
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,940
important systemic problem

267
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,320
um so uh if you know fatal System error

268
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,079
was super useful for me in part because

269
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,480
the crimes themselves were dumb it was

270
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,899
just DDOS and it was extortion behind

271
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,600
the DDOS uh and it's and it's maybe

272
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,180
really boring technologically but the

273
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,860
beauty part is my grandmother can

274
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,240
understand you know we're going to knock

275
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,860
over your business until you pay us

276
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,959
money which is what they were doing

277
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,940
the the great thing about fatal System

278
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,160
error is that the first people that were

279
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,060
doing DDOS for higher or DDOS for money

280
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,820
uh were going after offshore gambling

281
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,060
companies serving U.S Bettors and that's

282
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,440
sort of a weird you know why would you

283
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,899
attack another mob well it's because

284
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,880
they're you know their infrastructure

285
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,040
was in Costa Rica or wherever not

286
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,140
terrifically uh deep it's because

287
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,060
there's no heck and way to go into the

288
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,459
FBI for help and it's because if they're

289
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,980
down on Super Bowl Sunday they are

290
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,600
completely screwed also they have a ton

291
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,339
of cash on hand

292
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,860
um so I was able to tell the story of

293
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,579
basically mob versus mob and one guy who

294
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,579
sort of accidentally infiltrated the you

295
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,360
know American like Gambino Mobsters uh

296
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,000
by after protecting them and then

297
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,519
deliberately infiltrated the Russian mob

298
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,740
um and and wound up with three names you

299
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,779
know names of three real people who

300
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,640
eventually got sent to jail in Russia

301
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,560
and you know the point of the story

302
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,959
wasn't like you know Kumbaya we can all

303
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,360
do this together and get Russian baddies

304
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,300
it's it's it's the outrageous effort it

305
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,920
took including like the British foreign

306
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,680
secretary uh attempts on the British

307
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,320
detectives life uh in Russia all this

308
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,120
stuff to get three basically mid-level

309
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,920
people before the Russian government

310
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,139
said okay you can stop investigating now

311
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,880
rather than go Upstream thank you very

312
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,620
much time to go

313
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,240
um so it was just it was a terrific

314
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,220
window on everything and it just because

315
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,100
that's a heavy one I'll tell you my in a

316
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,260
way like a perfect encapsulation of a

317
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,100
similar era was the theft of sex.com

318
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,660
um you know it was registered by Gary

319
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,579
kremen when it was free to register

320
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,740
Network Solutions it just seemed like it

321
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,480
might be a good idea to have some time

322
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,240
and then um Network Solutions was like

323
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,300
run by five people in a monkey and

324
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,060
um this this uh you know Small Time

325
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,820
Hustler from jail wrote you know forged

326
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,740
Gary's signature in a letter Network

327
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,660
Solutions and wound up with the the

328
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,820
domain Maine I was raking in millions

329
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,380
and millions of dollars and living it

330
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,899
high off the hog in Mexico and basically

331
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,639
getting away with it and to me he's the

332
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,200
real hero of the story because is there

333
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,600
anything encapsulates the.com Smash and

334
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
grab era that that's it

335
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,899
so have any of you been approached by

336
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,760
somebody who's claiming to be

337
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,279
responsible for an attacker or some kind

338
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,740
of incident I'm curious for those of you

339
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,880
who have how do you verify them as as

340
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,639
sources and does the fact that they are

341
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,980
potential criminals impact the way that

342
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,779
you interpret the information that they

343
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,040
give you

344
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,180
um that's actually never happened to me

345
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,940
so I'm gonna pass it over

346
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,620
um first I just want to say you said you

347
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,260
weren't going to glorify the actors but

348
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,579
that's that that's 1999 in a nutshell

349
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,800
um I

350
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,399
yeah so I I'm curious to hear your

351
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,579
thoughts on this too but I definitely

352
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:39,540
have uh like corresponded with entities

353
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,060
you know claiming to be the actor behind

354
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,940
particularly data breaches

355
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,660
um and you know some sometimes like

356
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,000
ransomware gangs and stuff are often

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
have like a a PR account or sort of a

358
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,699
public-facing account you know on uh

359
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,139
criminal forums where they're like

360
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,480
available to talk so that was something

361
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,760
that I was just going to say about this

362
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,139
is that I have uh done those types of

363
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,079
correspondences but I never really felt

364
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,959
like I was the only one they were

365
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,000
talking to

366
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,800
um it always just kind of feels like

367
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,420
yeah they're probably talking to a bunch

368
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,300
of researchers or researchers who are

369
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,420
sort of posing as being members of that

370
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,820
cyber criminal community and then

371
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,639
they're trying to like uh get the the

372
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,320
word out probably with other reporters

373
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,399
as well and so uh yeah I have had those

374
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,040
situations but I I haven't really had

375
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,899
the experience of being like

376
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,420
oh like this person's only talking

377
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,980
to me and they're claiming that they did

378
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,260
you know what I mean so but I don't know

379
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,779
have you had other experiences yeah so

380
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,240
there are other reporters

381
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,339
um that do it more than I do I don't

382
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,320
make a big habit out of it in part

383
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,480
because you know in part it's a matter

384
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,000
of vetting but the real part is I don't

385
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,380
want to there are many cases where they

386
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,180
want publicity you know they're

387
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,639
publishing confidential information and

388
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,959
they want everyone to see that

389
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,459
confidential information and that's why

390
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,260
you go to the media because that puts

391
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,760
the most pressure on the company and I

392
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,079
don't want to be a part of that I don't

393
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,240
have like there's no hard and fast rule

394
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,800
but I have kind of personally a sliding

395
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
scale

396
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,180
um and you know the least likely I am

397
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,519
if it's like a nation-state activity and

398
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,779
they're trying to hurt you know

399
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,899
government X by leaking stuff my bar is

400
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,019
super high I want to see you know clear

401
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,240
public benefit from publishing the

402
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,160
information so I didn't do much

403
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,100
rummaging in the Sony hack

404
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,959
um because they're you know there was I

405
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,060
guess there's some mild racism and

406
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,320
there's some other like corruption

407
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,180
things but I didn't want to help out

408
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,040
North Korea

409
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,940
um so it you know the Whistleblower I'm

410
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,519
most most likely to publish something a

411
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,160
criminal group is in the middle

412
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,139
um but I haven't I haven't done a lot of

413
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,180
chatting with them as one of my more

414
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,500
memorable ones was I did chat with

415
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,300
guccifer too

416
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,579
um and he was saying you know hey I can

417
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,859
get you you know stuff on this stuff on

418
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,240
that

419
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,040
um and the FBI has already read this so

420
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,900
I'm not really revealing very much

421
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,240
um and you know I chatted him a while

422
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,799
and looked at what was available and

423
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,780
decided it wasn't it wasn't worth it to

424
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,000
me and so I passed

425
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,119
um and I I you know I later interviewed

426
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,339
FBI people were like yo I read that and

427
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,660
uh that was good that you did that not

428
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,280
everybody did best

429
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,020
well if they reach out to you on jabber

430
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,120
they must be legit say what if they

431
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,620
reach out to you on jabber they must

432
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,100
feel I feel like all of this happens

433
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,299
like that's why I never got anything

434
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,760
it's always

435
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,059
it's always funny to me when I see

436
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,260
stories where

437
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,059
um it's like somebody said this on like

438
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,700
Pace bin and was like okay I got that

439
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,500
like the company statement may not be

440
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,480
the most credible source of information

441
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,620
but why is that less credible than what

442
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,419
people are saying actually on these

443
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,020
forums well so so to me like a much more

444
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,080
common case for me is a security Reacher

445
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,820
researcher who's gone a little bit too

446
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,080
far maybe

447
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,820
um and gotten into some stuff saw some

448
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,440
bad things but shouldn't have been there

449
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,480
in the first place and so they're trying

450
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,000
to launder legitimate information about

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,240
avone or exposure through me and then

452
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,460
I'm you know often willing to play ball

453
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,600
along

454
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,360
um you know depending and sometimes I

455
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,520
know those researchers names and protect

456
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,140
them and sometimes I don't even know who

457
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,580
they are I just have to verify the

458
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,380
information somewhere else

459
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,020
uh what's the standard for you for

460
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,020
reporting on like the contents of emails

461
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,780
or data or information that

462
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,120
um that you receive through like a a

463
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,880
league or an attack of some kind like

464
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,840
um you know there's a lot of

465
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,000
conversation I think between security

466
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,400
practitioners and

467
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,200
um journalists unfortunately on Twitter

468
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,840
where it's not productive

469
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,780
um but you know just how do you decide

470
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,280
like

471
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,660
um because some of this information is

472
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,039
sensitive and some of it ends up being

473
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,419
personal some of it ends up being

474
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,580
identifiable for specific individuals

475
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,880
how do you decide like the contents

476
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,700
um that you will or won't publish

477
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,200
um I think part of it comes down to

478
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,419
newsworthiness and a lot of it like the

479
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:19,620
sensitive information that you're

480
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,780
talking about I I really don't find that

481
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,760
as newsworthy

482
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,620
um I think if the person involved in it

483
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,320
like wants this information like out

484
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
there then that's a little bit different

485
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,980
like sometimes when I report on a

486
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,660
warrant or something like that I will

487
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,280
like reach out to the person involved in

488
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,660
the warrant

489
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,280
um and if they're saying no like I want

490
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,020
like this out I want people to know that

491
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,660
I've been sent a warrant by you know

492
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,700
they didn't get Google didn't send them

493
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,840
the war but like you know they sent the

494
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,160
one to Google and then Google sends them

495
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,419
the alert

496
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,280
um then I will like pop if they want the

497
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,900
information out there and I I think it's

498
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,520
important to show like this is a real

499
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,160
person that this is affecting

500
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,620
um then yeah I I think part of it is

501
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,179
like consent and then the other part is

502
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:01,919
like very much newsworthiness and I

503
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,360
think personal information a lot of

504
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,640
times is just not doesn't rise to that

505
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,240
level for me

506
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,419
I feel like I already answered it you

507
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,340
know sliding sliding scale you know

508
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,039
you're weighing public benefit

509
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,500
um versus you know who what's the

510
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,660
probable motive who's the probable actor

511
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,280
and how much are you helping them by

512
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,380
doing this but there's almost no reason

513
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,960
to publish to publish anybody's private

514
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,480
information uh unless you know unless

515
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,820
you know it's a U.S senator like trying

516
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,039
to do business you know with the foreign

517
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,020
government or something yeah well you

518
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,760
remember uh Joe you were the one that

519
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,020
mentioned in our in our conversation

520
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,179
says we're preparing for this the the

521
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,640
possibility that like somebody may be

522
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,500
trying to get you to publish something

523
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,720
as a way to Blackmail someone or another

524
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,679
company and so I think being astute and

525
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,480
sensitive to what is this person's

526
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,980
motive

527
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,740
um I mean I'm in a position of luxury in

528
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,780
many ways and one of them is I am you

529
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,880
know I'm not paid per click and I'm not

530
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,820
desperate for traffic and so if I don't

531
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,160
want to help somebody out I don't I

532
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,620
don't have to and I think they're you

533
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,179
know there are other you know more

534
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,820
desperate you know Publications and

535
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,220
journalists who really need in order to

536
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,559
feed their families need to get some of

537
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,059
that stuff out there

538
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,039
um and I'm glad I don't have to do that

539
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,220
well and I was thinking about how like

540
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,559
one thing that's interesting is we all

541
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,200
sometimes end up like security beat

542
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,299
reporters sometimes end up playing like

543
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,520
a sort of gatekeeper role within The

544
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Newsroom because if the leaked

545
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,280
information is coming through us or

546
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,580
coming to us like the the stories that

547
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,880
are on our beat might be not about the

548
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,740
information itself or what it contains

549
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,220
but about uh what happened like what's

550
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,500
the incident or who's the actor or

551
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,820
what's you know what's the situation

552
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,820
that's like what's relevant to our beat

553
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,220
but if there's something in the material

554
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,440
that's like potentially newsworthy on a

555
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,120
different beat I mean I completely agree

556
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,520
like personal information of sort of

557
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,440
like private citizens without public

558
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,299
significance like that should never be

559
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,820
reported on there's no reason but you

560
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,720
know if there's something that's

561
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,780
potentially gonna affect or sort of be

562
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,280
interesting to colleagues on another

563
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,960
beat or something like that I think

564
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,140
that's where some of our expertise needs

565
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,320
to come in of like you're saying

566
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,960
attempting to kind of apply a sliding

567
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,700
scale because we all have just kind of

568
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,799
thought about this stuff a bit more than

569
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,179
people on other beats and just trying to

570
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,620
I don't know I feel some amount of

571
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,080
responsibility to like help triage that

572
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,400
rather than being like I don't know

573
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,659
someone sent me this weird thing I'm

574
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:47,039
only covering this part you do whatever

575
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,220
you know and like thinking about uh what

576
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,600
you're saying Melanie about the the

577
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,940
potential motivations of how this came

578
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,220
to be so I was just gonna say hunter

579
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,080
Biden's laptop is a really interesting

580
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,360
case study because there you have insane

581
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,600
competitive media pressure and you know

582
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,740
you're always going to be accused of

583
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,539
everything by all sides uh you're

584
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,520
suppressing the story or whatever but it

585
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,919
was it was hinky the way it came to

586
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,320
light and what we eventually did at the

587
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,539
Washington Post months later is we had

588
00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:19,020
some top Security Experts verify part of

589
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,679
the stuff as having been legit email

590
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,659
but most of the contents laptop they

591
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,539
could not verify and so we didn't get

592
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,220
into it we didn't report it I think it's

593
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,260
also just like a matter of discretion

594
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,919
too so around the time of uh you know

595
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,440
Elon dumpster fire

596
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,760
um there were a lot of people were

597
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,380
reporting on the the attorneys like

598
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,120
message on slack like saying hey you

599
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,020
know if you want to talk to a

600
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,280
whistleblower here's like the contact

601
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,220
information I'm pretty sure I hadn't

602
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,260
seen any Outlet like publish that

603
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,659
attorney is like name but like people

604
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:57,720
who who did report on it I I mean I had

605
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,640
seen the name but like I also made the

606
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,140
conscious decision like well that's not

607
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,020
really relevant to the article like the

608
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,820
point of it is that people at Twitter

609
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,620
are concerned

610
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,600
um so yeah I mean I'm glad that every

611
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,280
other reporter had reached the same

612
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,419
conclusion

613
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,100
yeah that actually reminds me of

614
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,799
something that I think is important for

615
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,260
us to know is that you're all

616
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,460
um

617
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,340
uh like print journalists

618
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,460
um or like Words journals text well text

619
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,299
text words yeah typed words

620
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,840
um whereas you know particularly you

621
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,280
know and I'll stick to the United States

622
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,440
so I don't end up sticking my foot in my

623
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
mouth but the the media landscape in the

624
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,919
United States

625
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,659
um varies depending on the medium that

626
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,140
we're talking about so print journalists

627
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,419
in general tend to be less politically

628
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,580
polarizing on on those types of stories

629
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,700
compared to say like our broadcast media

630
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,500
where there are certain Outlets that

631
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,900
really are specifically leaning

632
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,280
um intentionally

633
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,320
um on both sides

634
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,780
um and so you know it's it's for me it's

635
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,400
always interesting to see how different

636
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,000
types of outlets cover the same story

637
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,159
um and it just at least in my experience

638
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,200
the the print journalists tend to be

639
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,280
less political and less polarizing in

640
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,380
the way that um that they report it and

641
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,240
so I just wanted to to note that for the

642
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,440
folks here

643
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,480
um because this level-headedness that

644
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,340
you're hearing right now does not exist

645
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,700
in all newsrooms

646
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,460
and so I want to ask

647
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,960
um whether or not you think there's

648
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,880
something that those of us in this room

649
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,340
may not know

650
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,480
um about you know cyber crime journalism

651
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,820
um I actually think that covering cyber

652
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,039
crime is not all that different from

653
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,980
covering like just crime in general so I

654
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,080
before I I was even like a tech reporter

655
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,299
I covered the NYPD pretty extensively

656
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,940
and a lot of those skills like really

657
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,159
translated over to covering like cyber

658
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,380
crime a lot of it was like understanding

659
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,900
how to read court documents and um you

660
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,580
know police statements and things like

661
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,260
that and that really helped out with a

662
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,059
lot of the doj like pressures that they

663
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:10,320
that they do when they do like these

664
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,179
like big busts

665
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:13,679
um because they usually release like

666
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,600
their affidavit along with it and it's

667
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,700
like I feel like I've developed like

668
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,960
some pretty good skills of just like

669
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,400
reading through and through them like

670
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,900
very quickly and understanding what like

671
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,840
the key parts were so if you if you

672
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,279
understand how to do crime reporting I

673
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:28,020
think it translates very easily into

674
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,419
like cyber crime reporting I mean I'm

675
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:31,919
calling it cyber crime because I think

676
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,299
there's people in the back playing a

677
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,679
drinking game

678
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,320
um but

679
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,400
but yeah I think that's a really good

680
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,840
point

681
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,419
yeah I'm trying to think what

682
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,919
what like might be surprising about it

683
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,720
um

684
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,940
I don't know maybe just the thing we've

685
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,559
been talking about that there are so

686
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,320
many stakeholders and sort of into sorry

687
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,480
I hate that word like stakeholders but

688
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,159
you know that there's there's so many I

689
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,279
think you mean cyber stakeholders

690
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,620
okay drink

691
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,120
that you know there's so many there's

692
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,580
just so many sort of uh interests

693
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,679
involved in these situations I I guess I

694
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,240
I hadn't really thought about it but it

695
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,659
is sort of a specific reporting uh

696
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,659
challenge or just sort of sub-discipline

697
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:25,500
to like manage because you're trying to

698
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,080
it's like victims or like often trying

699
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,179
to cover up or obfuscate what happened

700
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,760
especially if they feel like the way

701
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,380
that and there's this sort of victim

702
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,720
shaming that is really problematic but

703
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,380
sometimes it's like well why was that

704
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,380
organization like so poorly protected or

705
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,240
why was that government age why hadn't

706
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,720
that government agency implemented like

707
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,360
the uh cyber security improvements that

708
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,520
were mandated 10 years ago that they

709
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,039
wrote right you know that they wrote

710
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,559
exactly so you know it's like there is

711
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,140
this very complicated interplay

712
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,640
um to try to uh get to just a story that

713
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,520
is straightforward and digestible and in

714
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,500
plain language and and one other thing I

715
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,580
was going to say when I called it words

716
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,559
journalism and everyone laughed because

717
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,200
like everything's words like makes sense

718
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,840
I get that but I I call it that because

719
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,840
it's like the different mediums have a

720
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,000
different amount of like composition

721
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,100
time like you know uh like news that is

722
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,220
like uh Network news that's like a

723
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,960
conversation or something people are

724
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,360
like speaking extemporaneously in real

725
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,720
time it's different from the medium

726
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,880
being that people are going to read or

727
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,940
like you know hear the words that you

728
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,980
composed like that it's they're just

729
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,020
different mediums and uh you put

730
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,880
together stories in different ways you

731
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,500
know depending

732
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,940
um and there there is like an

733
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,039
intentionality and uh it's there's a

734
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,340
friction to composing words that then

735
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,559
people are gonna you know read or hear

736
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,600
back

737
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,940
that can be helpful for thoughtfulness

738
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,340
on these things can you imagine if every

739
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,900
white paper had to have like a video

740
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,960
component with it as well yeah they've

741
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,299
already done branding you know this is

742
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:16,559
Heartbleed I guess that was the first

743
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,179
one it's not a real phone unless it has

744
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:22,320
a logo right so um I you know I think

745
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,059
security is an incredibly important

746
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,059
thing I've been covering security for 23

747
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,559
years now

748
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,140
um and I'm going to keep on covering it

749
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,480
um and I think of cybercrime as a subset

750
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,840
of that uh the reason I think it's

751
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,980
fascinating is that it's

752
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,899
interdisciplinary it's like a criminal

753
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:41,700
justice story and a geopolitical story

754
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,580
and a market failure story and a market

755
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,340
capture story there's lots of different

756
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,340
things going on that you don't get to by

757
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,279
writing most tech stuff

758
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,380
um security is really at the heart of it

759
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,919
but you're going to get more readers

760
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,240
when there's an you know Somebody's

761
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,919
knocking over a hospital than you do

762
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,659
when you talk about you know bad patch

763
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,940
management practices

764
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,399
um so I I think I think it's useful in

765
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,000
in that way but it's um you know I don't

766
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
care about a specific crime you know I

767
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,720
care about why uh why we haven't really

768
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,539
done very much about ransomware like why

769
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,820
is why are we as a government as a

770
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,559
society unable to get our act together

771
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,039
and beat this and so crime is a way to

772
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,000
talk about those things to me and I want

773
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,419
to build on that a bit Joe and ask what

774
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,700
is the difference I mean I mean I know a

775
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,500
lot of reporters who once they have an

776
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,940
idea for a story they then have to go

777
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,220
pitch an editor right so each individual

778
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,020
reporter may not actually get to choose

779
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,419
exactly which story or which angle they

780
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,399
go with and so I'm curious from your

781
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,720
perspective what is the process for you

782
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
know choosing to focus on something you

783
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,799
know that's more systemic like that of

784
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,100
why have we not figured out ransomware

785
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,779
um versus

786
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,840
um you know like covering like you know

787
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,419
those spot crimes like you said like is

788
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,919
there a different process for the

789
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,600
journalist and how you formulate that

790
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,940
story and how you get buy-in

791
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,760
um you know from the editorial folks

792
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,039
um I think we're expected to do both uh

793
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,840
like you are expected to do like this

794
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,520
spot news coverage like day-to-day

795
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,039
things but I think when you're when

796
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:27,720
you're steeped in all of this like all

797
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,399
the time you do start to notice patterns

798
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,140
you do start to notice Trends and then

799
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,940
that's kind of when I bring it up with

800
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,860
my editor of you know I I keep hearing

801
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,440
this I keep hearing about it let's like

802
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,240
dig deeper into this and give it more of

803
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,740
a focus

804
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,360
um like like as you said like with

805
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,580
ransomware for example yeah we were

806
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,740
writing about these like spot ransomware

807
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,000
attacks obviously like I don't think

808
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,120
wannacry was a a spot news kind of story

809
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
but

810
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,260
um then it became you know uh the city

811
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,480
of like Atlanta has been hit by it and

812
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,100
then some other City gets it and then

813
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,899
you notice oh a lot of these like cities

814
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,240
are being targeted now and what are they

815
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,260
doing about it they all have like

816
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,700
different responses and things like that

817
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,320
and then I think all of those questions

818
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,360
just naturally like coalesce into like

819
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,740
its own story

820
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,960
um and my editors have always been

821
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,360
pretty receptive of that so it has not

822
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,279
been an uphill battle for me to get them

823
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,100
on board with these kinds of stories

824
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,779
I'm curious what you think I'm just like

825
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:25,679
watching this panel too so

826
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,340
um

827
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,500
it's it's changed depending on where

828
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,559
where I where is working at the time so

829
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,500
the post fortunately has like a high bar

830
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,120
you know they care about the most

831
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,980
impactful biggest thing so Colonial

832
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,539
pipeline you're going to write wannacry

833
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,399
you're going to write and then maybe

834
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:42,899
you'll come back with an explainer

835
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,880
analysis or something in a little bit or

836
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,140
maybe you'll get a cool investigative

837
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,120
piece down the road but you know the

838
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,460
breach of the day is is not their thing

839
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,559
which is great and I don't want to write

840
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,320
the breach of the day and I'll read all

841
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,779
the cool like vone research but it's

842
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,880
unless I see it an important what I

843
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,380
think is an important pattern and

844
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,020
something that's really novel you know

845
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,059
and has wider impact I'm not going to do

846
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:07,100
that so

847
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,899
there are many stories from the before

848
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:11,880
times when nobody was covering this and

849
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,039
editors didn't understand it where it

850
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,960
was really Bleak and like the one that

851
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,399
comes to my mind is when I was working

852
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,039
for the financial times which is you

853
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,200
know on August publication but very top

854
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,659
down and in a really bad time zone for

855
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:28,440
me and I got woken up as I often did at

856
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,140
like 5 30 or 6 in the morning by some

857
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,320
guy in London saying look you know the

858
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,720
editor-in-chief you know

859
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,659
hackers have broken into the CIA and you

860
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,580
know we want it on page you know you

861
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,320
know theater in Chief wants it on page

862
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,080
one in in two hours and you know I'm

863
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,580
just you know I'm out of a cold sleep

864
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,440
and so it takes me five minutes to find

865
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,600
out it's a DDOS on their public facing

866
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
website and you know anybody could do

867
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,500
that

868
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,059
um and then they're like you know and I

869
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,380
tried to explain it and they got mad at

870
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,760
me you know like you're I'm

871
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,399
contradicting 90 minutes Steve yeah I'm

872
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,440
contradictoring the the editor-in-chief

873
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,080
and I'm like trying to get out of work

874
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,639
and so like there I had this desperate

875
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,619
struggle to come up with some story that

876
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:14,099
is that is true and you know is is

877
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,599
interesting enough to get them off my

878
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,239
backs and keep this off of page one

879
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,820
um and it's it was a frustrating process

880
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,580
and I think as a whole the journalism on

881
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,859
the stuff has gotten so much better than

882
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:27,480
it used to be

883
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,820
yeah the one thing I would add is like

884
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,040
that maybe also ties into things people

885
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,440
don't know or something I but a lot of

886
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,820
people probably know this in this room

887
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,560
it's just like that you know the the

888
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,179
main thing we can contend with is like

889
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,800
the difference between a topic and a

890
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,780
story you know you can't just like do a

891
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,020
report on a topic so even if you're like

892
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,679
okay this I have you know seen this uh

893
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,020
pattern in ransomware stuff and I sort

894
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,060
of have this thesis about it like it

895
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,219
needs to be reported and it needs to be

896
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,040
timely or have sort of a new element in

897
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
some way so wired is also very

898
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,760
supportive about kind of doing both

899
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,560
types of stories like the news coverage

900
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,619
and the more steps back news analysis uh

901
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,640
type thing but that is just an important

902
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,460
um like Baseline quality issue with

903
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,440
journalism you know when you're when

904
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,720
you're pitching is like it can't just be

905
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,579
because something is like abstractly

906
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,460
interesting it needs to be grounded

907
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,660
awesome

908
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,280
um well I could continue this with the

909
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,900
three review all day long thank you so
