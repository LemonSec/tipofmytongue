1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,960
and thank you for the opportunity to

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,940
present today my name is Shanna Devine

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,320
I'm the director of the office of The

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,119
Whistleblower ombuds

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,500
um I do wish I could be there with you

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,660
in person due to some health health

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,640
reasons I had to participate virtually

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,880
but I continue to be grateful for Zoom

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,140
um and I am looking forward to

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,360
participating in the Q a after this

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,880
presentation through the slack Channel

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,219
so to get started here I just wanted to

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,780
provide an overview I am going to be

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,219
going through the ways in which our

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,960
office advises the House of

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,379
Representatives on best practices when

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,180
working with whistleblers to come

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,739
forward from the public and the private

20
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,559
sectors this may be constituents looking

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,539
for support against retaliation and

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,340
maybe potential oversight sources

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,579
reaching out to the correct committee

24
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:01,559
Myriad of circumstances but I'm also

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,699
going to touch on the ways in which

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,400
Congress can excuse me um ways in which

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,979
whistleblowers can take precautions on

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,119
their end to protect their

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,680
Communications when they're working with

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,880
Congress

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,799
so with that I want to start by looking

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,479
at a recent example of congress's

33
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,159
partnership with the key whistleblower

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,020
that I'm sure this community is familiar

35
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,759
with

36
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,979
before you as an excerpt from Twitter's

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,799
former Chief security officer who goes

38
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,880
by much

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,619
and testimony before the Senate

40
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,780
Judiciary Committee just last September

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,100
he stated

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,439
I'm here today because Twitter's

43
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,799
leadership is misleading the public

44
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,840
lawmakers regulators and even its own

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,579
board of directors

46
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,500
what I discovered when I joined Twitter

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,900
was that this enormously influential

48
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,000
company was over a decade behind

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,640
industry security standards the

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,799
company's cyber security failure

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,079
makes it vulnerable to exploitation

52
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,920
causing real harm to real people

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,380
again I'm sure this audience is familiar

54
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,360
with much as whistleblowing

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,759
but what's so powerful is that his

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,940
disclosures gripped everyday consumers

57
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,979
right including those users who are

58
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,540
directly impacted by these security

59
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,480
failures those real people he referred

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,379
to

61
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,900
and he strategically turned his

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,840
knowledge into Power by sharing it with

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,940
everyone in society who should be

64
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,400
benefiting from his disclosures

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,060
from Congress to the public

66
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,340
now throughout history Congress has

67
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,900
relied on the civil lawyers to conduct

68
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,000
effective oversight

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,220
but Congress has also lacked clear

70
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,080
guidelines for how to safely and

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,760
effectively work with these individuals

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,280
which unfortunately has at times led to

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,379
unintentional harm

74
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,260
that's where our office comes in we were

75
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,840
established in the 116th Congress as an

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,519
independent and nonpartisan support

77
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,440
office within the House of

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,060
Representatives we're under the

79
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,440
jurisdiction of the committee on house

80
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,940
administration

81
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,700
now collectively our team of three has

82
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,739
about 35 years of experience really

83
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,080
working across the aisle to support

84
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,420
congress's work with whistleblowers

85
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,239
one of our team members John Woody also

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,800
has unique background in network

87
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,780
engineering and Technical security and

88
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,300
you'll see that play out in our guidance

89
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,580
our primary function is to advise Health

90
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,440
offices on best practices when they're

91
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,940
working with whistleblers from both the

92
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,220
public and the private sectors

93
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,739
two points of clarification one we don't

94
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,420
have a senate counterpart we're just

95
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,420
house facing until we don't have the

96
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,280
authority to receive disclosures from

97
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,659
whistleblowers

98
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,400
but there are ways in which we can

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,620
provide guiding resources that are

100
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,180
publicly available on our website and

101
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,819
I'll go into that further

102
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,519
now briefly our services include

103
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
trainings on best practices in addition

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,799
we can help offices to further develop

105
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,420
their intake procedures when working

106
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,580
with whistleblers we can share

107
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,340
confidential consultations with them to

108
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,959
assist staff when they're responding to

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,000
individual whistle or inquiries they may

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,400
receive we can also provide technical

111
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
expertise around with supplier

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,440
legislation

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,060
so most of our trainings really start

114
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,040
with educating Congress on how to

115
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,500
identify a whistle or matter in the

116
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,298
first place and the additional

117
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,399
precautions required

118
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,740
so in Broad terms we describe

119
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,960
whistleblowers as individuals disclosing

120
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
abuses of power that betray the public

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,220
Trust

122
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,560
these individuals commonly reach out to

123
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
their member office or the relevant

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
Committee of jurisdiction

125
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,500
and what we do is help to coach offices

126
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,840
on some of those key distinctions from

127
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,300
traditional casework and witness work

128
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,759
right as we touched on this includes the

129
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,199
role that whistleblowers can play in

130
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,479
helping to advance oversight but also

131
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,419
unique confidentiality requirements

132
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,180
as well as the risks that whistleblowers

133
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,520
take when coming forward

134
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,040
now nearly all Whistler statutes do

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,560
protect Communications with Congress but

136
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,240
the strength of those rights varies

137
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,800
across sectors

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,199
and our office helps the house to

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,820
navigate what those complexities are

140
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,520
now let's take a moment to look at why

141
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,520
whistleblowers come forward frankly the

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,620
reality is that most don't intend to

143
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,300
become whistleblowers I mean this is

144
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,800
probably the most difficult decision

145
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,180
they're going to make throughout their

146
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,520
career and more often than not they

147
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,860
don't feel it as a decision as we saw

148
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,960
with mudges whistleblowing they're

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,639
usually simply trying to protect their

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,979
organization's Mission or they think

151
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,320
they're simply doing their job and

152
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,360
frankly for that reason many may not

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
even identify with the label

154
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,919
whistleblower when they reach out now in

155
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,419
fact executive branch employees are

156
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,880
actually required to disclose waste

157
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,220
fraud abuse and Corruption to the

158
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,320
appropriate authorities

159
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,199
well before they know it whistleras

160
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,759
commonly find themselves at a

161
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,560
professional crossroads right dealing

162
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,880
with different threats and pressures

163
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,979
they never anticipated

164
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,720
it's not unusual for them to experience

165
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,300
gaslighting start to question their own

166
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,979
reality or the evidence they're bringing

167
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,560
forward commonly they're pushed out of

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,539
their chosen career field

169
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,120
or even treated as if they've committed

170
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,020
a crime for exposing some type of crime

171
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,020
let two examples come to mind these were

172
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,020
both shortly after the um the 911 Tax

173
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,419
within the U.S so let's take the first

174
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,639
example of a former NSA contractor

175
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,620
Edward Loomis

176
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,560
now he reported government waste on an

177
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
ineffective and illegal domestic

178
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,120
surveillance program he reported this up

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,220
the proper chain of command

180
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,819
and after he came forward he himself

181
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,800
became the target of a retaliatory

182
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,259
criminal investigation that ultimately

183
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,479
cost him his career

184
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,000
his colleague Thomas Drake

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,460
he was threatened with 35 years in

186
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,759
prison under the Espionage Act after he

187
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,919
legally provided an unclassified

188
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,460
briefing on the surveillance program

189
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,400
um to a reporter that he had worked with

190
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,039
the reality is whistleblers come forward

191
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,699
a significant risk to themselves

192
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,919
that said

193
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,680
we like to ask staff why they feel the

194
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,419
primary reason is

195
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,639
that potential with Solaris ultimately

196
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,740
don't come forward

197
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,080
any thoughts on your ends as well just

198
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,340
take a moment to think about it

199
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,919
now interestingly enough

200
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,199
research has found that number one

201
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,240
reason potential whistleblers don't come

202
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,539
forward is this fear of futility

203
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,759
a fear that their disclosures won't have

204
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,039
an impact and won't make a difference

205
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,740
and therefore they're not worth the risk

206
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,780
and that risk is the second primary

207
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,460
reason they don't come forward the fear

208
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,639
of retaliation

209
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,919
that said those who do speak up they're

210
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:00,479
trying to sort out a critical life's

211
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,039
Choice by working effectively with

212
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,199
Congress and for them to take that step

213
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,759
they need to have confidence in the

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,900
process

215
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,520
so I'm going to go ahead and introduce

216
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,500
some foundational principles that we

217
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,479
share with house offices to keep in mind

218
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,639
when they're working with whistleblowers

219
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,500
these are largely grounded in

220
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,580
establishing Trust

221
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,259
so the first rule of thumb before you is

222
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,440
Do no harm right ideally in office once

223
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,060
an individual will be better off after

224
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,620
they contact them

225
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,319
but certainly not force off

226
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,760
and it's important they move forward

227
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,140
cautiously

228
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,899
so they can start by establishing ground

229
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,059
rules with the Whistleblower around how

230
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,200
they're going to work with their

231
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,458
information

232
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,600
this can help avoid any surprises

233
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,339
and also help to ensure that they're

234
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,380
maintaining their desired level of

235
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,660
confidentiality which they should

236
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,279
discuss early on

237
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,180
next to manage expectations offices we

238
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,920
advise should clearly communicate the

239
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,899
limits around what they can and cannot

240
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:01,740
do

241
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,720
for instance Congress can't provide

242
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,760
legal advice to a whistleblower

243
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,279
but they should provide some guiding

244
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,580
resources to help and Orient The

245
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,800
Whistler or early in their process this

246
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,019
may include you know a menu of Whistler

247
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,880
support organizations that we've made

248
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,940
public on our website

249
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,980
now to the extended office makes a

250
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,320
commitment we stress the importance of

251
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,660
them trying to honor it right this may

252
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,880
be something as basic as sticking with a

253
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,980
deadline they've committed to

254
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,080
to something more substantive like

255
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,060
sending that follow-up letter to the oig

256
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,160
to try and get movement on a retaliation

257
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,779
investigation

258
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,700
now all of these apps are going to help

259
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,260
build confidence in that working

260
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,220
relationship moving forward

261
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,200
well next partnering on overstate is

262
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,120
such a key one as the experts

263
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,640
whistleblowers can be incredible allies

264
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,800
at that follow-up stage

265
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,420
and they're eager to be put to work

266
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,680
right that's why they're coming forward

267
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,720
they want to have an impact

268
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,899
so some examples we provide offices are

269
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,940
rather than asking The Whistleblower for

270
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,740
the documents directly

271
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,740
ask them for a road map of documents

272
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,660
that the Congressional offices can then

273
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,940
request from the employer

274
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,800
at the same time they need to be careful

275
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,100
not to provide two specific a level of

276
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,560
document document requests that could be

277
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,360
traced back to the source and we'll go

278
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,700
into that further

279
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,160
um next you know offices can ask the

280
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,959
whistleblers if they have colleagues who

281
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,760
are willing to cooperate their concerns

282
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,220
of course this will help expand the

283
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,680
office's body of evidence

284
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,899
but it's also a lot more difficult for

285
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,720
an employer to discredit one individual

286
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,300
versus maybe half a dozen Witnesses you

287
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,700
know we really stress that solidarity is

288
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,959
key to survival within the

289
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,839
whistleblowing field

290
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,680
now again in terms of the

291
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,200
whistleblower's expertise they can help

292
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,060
to prep questions for a hearing or maybe

293
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,740
an oversight letter

294
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,300
um then an office is sending us a result

295
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,160
of their disclosures they can also

296
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,019
brainstorm corrective action policy

297
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,079
Solutions yeah the list goes on there's

298
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,000
endless amounts of creativity when it

299
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,220
comes to partnering on oversight

300
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,560
but let me wrap up on principles with

301
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,959
stressing that arguably nothing is more

302
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,140
important than an office standing by its

303
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,040
sources

304
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,899
now we stress that members who develop

305
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,720
those strong reputations become magnets

306
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,600
for future whistleblowers of course the

307
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,760
goal is to prevent retaliation

308
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,459
but when that's not possible

309
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,839
Congressional offices have powerful

310
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,060
tools at their disposal behold

311
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,040
Retaliator is accountable

312
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,500
for instance there's a law that allows

313
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,040
Congress to cut off the salary of

314
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,260
um of an employee within the federal

315
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,079
government who has tried to gag a

316
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,339
whistleblower from lawfully

317
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,800
communicating with Congress there are a

318
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,180
number of other tools too and we're

319
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,399
available to coach offices on on how to

320
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,060
utilize them

321
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,040
that we have developed desk guides as

322
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,079
well as templates to help facilitate the

323
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,880
House's work with whistleblowers this

324
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,680
includes everything from mitigating

325
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
risks during that initial intake stage

326
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,440
to safely partnering on oversight and

327
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
these resources are largely public on

328
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,820
our website

329
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,339
so our latest model resource our sample

330
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,100
whistleblower confidentiality policy is

331
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,440
especially relevant and timely for this

332
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,019
audience it reflects that those ground

333
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,820
rules that I started to preview as well

334
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,740
as our information security best

335
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,600
practices

336
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,399
so I'm just going to take a moment to

337
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,899
highlight some of the guidance within

338
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,459
that policy

339
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,740
now as an office collects information

340
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,720
from whistleblowers

341
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,000
they should advise them of

342
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,220
first and foremost their right to

343
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,620
confidentiality under the house code of

344
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,820
conduct

345
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,620
this was a recent development in the

346
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,720
last Congress that the current Congress

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,079
maintained notably and it prohibits the

348
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,899
house from publicly identifying a

349
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,760
protected whistleblower without their

350
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,920
Advanced spreading consent

351
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,019
and we have guidelines for compliance

352
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,519
with that

353
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,700
the second rule of thumb here is Let The

354
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,800
Whistleblower know that they have the

355
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,560
right to the integrity and security of

356
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,420
the information

357
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,060
um to be adequately protected

358
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,980
again they have the right to have their

359
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,100
information adequately protected

360
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,680
so for instance information should only

361
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,959
be shared and stored through secure

362
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,139
official house accounts I'm doing this

363
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,880
will largely help to trigger protections

364
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,100
under the speech and debate clause

365
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,019
in addition the house should limit

366
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,720
access to the information on a need to

367
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,459
know basis

368
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,079
but that can be critical to that

369
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,500
information control

370
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,240
next the whistlebler has the right to

371
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,940
review the information in advance of its

372
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,800
use by an office

373
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,839
right this is both for quality control

374
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,480
to make sure that the Congressional

375
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,720
office's record is accurate but also for

376
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,959
confidentiality concerns but we like to

377
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,360
stress that the facts alone can be a

378
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
whistleblower's signature so it's

379
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,779
important that the office partner with

380
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,459
the Whistleblower in advance of acting

381
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,740
on their information to make sure that

382
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,019
they're accurately capturing and this

383
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,079
underlying disclosures and concerns

384
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,720
while at the same time camouflaging The

385
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,399
Whistleblower as the source of

386
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,700
information

387
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
now this also includes screening the

388
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,079
information for metadata right such as

389
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
maybe an IP address or watermarks

390
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,940
this is critical to avoid what happened

391
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,279
for instance with reality winner some of

392
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,800
you may recall that her anonymity was

393
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,660
compromised after she provided

394
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,279
documentation around the Russian

395
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,980
interference in U.S elections

396
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,899
well at the same time there are

397
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,940
strategic actions that The Whistleblower

398
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,060
and Congress can take to mitigate that

399
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,279
level of risk

400
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
now lastly

401
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,240
we stress the importance of letting the

402
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,040
Whistleblower know they have the right

403
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,279
to object to the use including sharing

404
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,620
of their information

405
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,019
that is a congressional office will

406
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,300
first obtain their consent before

407
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,000
sharing it further

408
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,339
now at the same time while we have these

409
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:21,779
Grand rules

410
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,000
we still caution

411
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
the importance of offices not over

412
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,199
promising the level of confidentiality

413
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:30,240
that they can provide a whistleblower

414
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,639
the reality is as this community knows

415
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,100
you can never guarantee confidentiality

416
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,440
due to factors that may be Beyond any

417
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,899
individual's control right such as the

418
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,060
state of surveillance technology

419
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,060
as well as legal limitations

420
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,180
well for that reason it's important that

421
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,579
whistleblowers also take precautions on

422
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,139
their end to protect their

423
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:55,339
Communications with Congress

424
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,660
now before you use a menu of

425
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,940
whistleblower survival tips these have

426
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,680
been informed by experts who have worked

427
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,420
with thousands of whistleblowers to

428
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,000
share their lessons learned and frankly

429
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
these can help whistleblers virtually

430
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,620
protect themselves while still having an

431
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,639
impact

432
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,500
now I'm not going to go into these in

433
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,360
depth I understand that Emily Schwartz

434
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,980
has an excellent related presentation

435
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,199
scheduled next on communication do's and

436
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,600
don'ts for whistleblowers but just to

437
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,940
give you a flavor of our guidance and

438
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,680
some of the things we stress the

439
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,480
Congressional office share with the

440
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,440
Whistleblower for them to keep in mind

441
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,199
are seeking experienced legal counsel as

442
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,660
early as possible in their process right

443
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,639
and making a plan with the council for

444
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,220
how to safely proceed

445
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,380
now for the whistlebler when they're

446
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,660
communicating with Congress they may

447
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,699
want to consider meeting in person in a

448
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,040
discreet location and certainly if

449
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,300
they're going to communicate digitally

450
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,480
use encrypted communication platforms

451
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,860
that can't be monitored by their

452
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,139
employer right maybe something like the

453
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,199
signal or wicker apps and then likewise

454
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,300
the Congressional office should be using

455
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,919
these on their end as well for that

456
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,839
end-to-end encryption

457
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,220
of course they can also think of

458
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,020
alternative channels to share their

459
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,359
evidence maybe through their attorney or

460
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,339
another trusted entity that can serve as

461
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,900
a buffer and help to reduce that paper

462
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,220
trail

463
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,799
again this is where whistleblowers can

464
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,419
coach offices on how to obtain

465
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:25,020
documentation directly from the employer

466
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,819
but making sure to broaden that

467
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,700
information kind of request so that it's

468
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,400
not so specific that it could be traced

469
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,200
back to a whistlebler if say they're one

470
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,600
of half a dozen employees who who knows

471
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,480
where the documents may exist and knows

472
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,799
where to find them so a little bit of

473
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,020
strategy that goes into

474
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,400
um into that approach working

475
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,059
effectively

476
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,940
now as part of our commitment to

477
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,580
transparency around operations but our

478
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,799
survival tips and frankly nearly all of

479
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,080
our resources are publicly accessible on

480
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,700
our website which can be accessed at

481
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,280
whistleblower.house.gov

482
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,799
now it is organized by these two key

483
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,679
categories Congressional audience and

484
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,880
whistleblower audience

485
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,340
just as a preview for this Congress one

486
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,440
of our goals is to have at least one

487
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,480
staff within each member and committee

488
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,500
office

489
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,480
certified in our new working with

490
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,240
whistleblowers curriculum which is

491
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,520
previewed on your screen now although

492
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,919
the QR codes are only accessible to

493
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,780
Congressional staff within the house

494
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,360
most of our videos are publicly

495
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,940
available via our website

496
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,380
um so feel free to praise them if

497
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,919
they're of Interest

498
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,580
now in closing I did just want to share

499
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,440
with you our vision

500
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,419
um take a moment to reflect on that and

501
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,460
how we're we're working toward advancing

502
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,840
it each day

503
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
our vision before you is to

504
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,440
institutionalize

505
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,080
really best practices for congress's

506
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,059
work with whistle-players this includes

507
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,580
safe effective and consistent practices

508
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,280
this is all in furtherance of congress's

509
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,740
article Article 1 oversight and

510
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,080
constituent responsibilities

511
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
oh we realize this is a fairly ambitious

512
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,840
Vision given that engagement with our

513
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,120
office is voluntary

514
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,640
but frankly engagement today

515
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,679
demonstrates that there's a demand for

516
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,740
our guidance now just as a preview

517
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,080
um our annual report from 2022 is about

518
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,880
to be released publicly on our website

519
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,960
and we found that in the 117th Congress

520
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,320
about two-thirds of all House member

521
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,539
offices as well as committees utilized

522
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,960
our services

523
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,520
so we're hoping there's more to come in

524
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,380
the 118th Congress

525
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,600
with that I'll go ahead and wrap it up I

526
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,480
just want to thank again Joe Melanie and

527
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,039
really everyone who worked behind the

528
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,539
scenes to organize this important

529
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,000
Gathering and I'm looking forward to

530
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,679
addressing any questions you may have in

531
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,960
that slack channel in addition don't

532
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,460
hesitate to reach out to our office

533
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,440
directly if we can be a service our

534
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,559
contact information is on your screen

535
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,360

536
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,979
Communications thanks so much
