1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:18,300
my name is Emily Schwartz which is now

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,100
on the screen and I have multiplied

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,320
myself and when I made the slides I

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,600
didn't quite think about how creepy that

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,460
would be so

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,939
um apologies but this is me this is me

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,460
um I am the vice president of

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,079
communications uh for a PR agency in

10
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,520
full service digital media company

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,940
called Bryce and Gillette so it's also

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,399
incredibly intimidating

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,739
um to be up here speaking with you all

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,320
because it's rare

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,020
that you walk into a room and you're

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,579
completely certain that you're the

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,260
dumbest person in the room

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,239
but it's even more rare that then they

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,460
give you the mic so

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,699
um bear with me people here we go I it's

21
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,140
my presentation so I get to talk about

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,180
me for a little bit longer uh I'm

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,340
originally from Wichita Kansas

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,900
I mostly put this in like every

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,939
presentation just to see if anyone else

26
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,400
happens to be from Kansas and I would

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,500
say 90 of the time including in this

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,140
room the answer is no so um I now live

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,580
in Los Angeles

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,640
um and I am here to talk to you about

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,460
whistleblower Communications and I am

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,880
not even a communicator by background so

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,400
you know thank you Melanie I guess for

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,560
this opportunity and blame her if it's

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,860
not any good uh my background's actually

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,159
in uh policy mostly so I spent time at

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,780
the U.S Senate the World Trade

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,759
Organization

39
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,560
um did a little send to the startup

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,299
because like everyone has a dream of a

41
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,520
unicorn mine didn't quite work out but

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,180
uh and then most recently led a data

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,040
policy at Uber

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,420
and

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,939
I jumped into Communications because

46
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,060
what I found having been a policy wonk

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,860
and perhaps some of you in this room

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,560
have feel the same way is that I was

49
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,340
doing a lot of kind of hard work and

50
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,800
what I thought to be brilliant work and

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,260
oftentimes it wasn't having the impact

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,379
that I wanted it to have and many times

53
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,599
I found that was because I wasn't

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,980
communicating I was writing these

55
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,840
beautiful in-depth reports that no one

56
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,160
was reading and so I said okay I've got

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,879
to fix this I want to help people

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,000
and communicate better to just have

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,480
their hard work be seen and do it with

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,599
um authenticity and intentionality and

61
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,940
uh using whatever tools and tactics we

62
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,959
can so

63
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,540
I I now I'm at a firm Club rice and

64
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,319
Gillette I have worked with I'm actually

65
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,580
most of my clients are not

66
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,260
whistleblowers

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,620
um but they are you know Big Fang

68
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,660
companies many of whom I'm sure in this

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,840
room uh and I I get I have the

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
opportunity to work on like a really

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,379
wide variety of product launches or

72
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,780
autonomous vehicle deployments

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,580
um but the reason I'm here today is

74
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,159
because in

75
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,700
mid kind of Summer of 2021 I met this

76
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,659
woman

77
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:23,099
I some of you may know her uh but her

78
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,519
name is Francis Haugen and she became

79
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,900
one of many

80
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,420
um but a fairly significant Facebook

81
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,519
whistleblower

82
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,900
so I want to take a little bit of time

83
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,879
to walk you through kind of a brief

84
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,060
history of what happened with Francis

85
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,819
and what the pr strategy was

86
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,239
specifically behind her whistle blow and

87
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
then I will end the presentation

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,760
um with a a little bit of how to's and

89
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,500
hopefully teach you all something

90
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,080
because you don't talk to the press all

91
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,680
day about when you do decide to talk to

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,000
the Press

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,420
you know some things to keep in mind

94
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,360
um okay so I met Francis

95
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,640
and I found out that

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,600
um she had disclosed uh 20 000 plus

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,800
pages of documents uh outlining

98
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,180
um a huge variety of harms

99
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,940
um that were being documented within

100
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,699
Facebook these were things from

101
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,979
devastating impact on Teen Mental Health

102
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,280
of Instagram uh accusations of lying or

103
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,040
being deceitful to the investors in

104
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,479
oversight board

105
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,199
timeline of actions of actions taken and

106
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,139
not taken on January 6th and

107
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,080
and uh one of the things that was most

108
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000
important to her was really the lack of

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,639
investment in the Safety Systems in

110
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,880
places outside of uh English in

111
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,740
non-english speaking countries

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,680
um leading to real world violence in

113
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,800
places like India Myanmar and Ethiopia

114
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,060
um as I said like I'm typically running

115
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,440
product launches and doing things like

116
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,500
that so I was like uh okay uh so I meet

117
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,979
her and say okay great like this is big

118
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,800
what's your goal and she's like cool

119
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,039
that's easy massive systemic change

120
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,120
and I was like

121
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,039
all right

122
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,039
so

123
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,179
so where do we begin

124
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,780
um

125
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,160
I'll walk you through a bit of a

126
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,560
timeline we basically laid out a plan

127
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,880
right

128
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,100
so September 13th The Wall Street

129
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,680
Journal publishes its first story

130
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,979
um in a series called the Facebook files

131
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,479
and her identity is still unknown at

132
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
this time while we worked with 60

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,720
Minutes

134
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,780
um to publicly reveal her about two

135
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,820
weeks later

136
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,060
um that's October 3rd two days later uh

137
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,300
she testifies in front of the U.S Senate

138
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,520
for approximately six hours

139
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,539
on and answers questions ranging from

140
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,940
National Security threats impact on

141
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,020
teens

142
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,720
uh advertising questions you know all

143
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,600
across the board our team was

144
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,280
responsible for prepping her for that

145
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,960
testimony

146
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,580
um writing the testimony kind of all of

147
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,500
the above

148
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,580
um

149
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,020
a about two weeks after that we as we

150
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,560
had negotiated a global media embargo so

151
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,780
we knew that the journal with 20 000

152
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,360
plus pages of documents as incredible as

153
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,639
a team as they were we're not going to

154
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,560
be able to give that the kind of breadth

155
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,280
and depth that it deserved and so there

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,660
were over 30 Global News organizations

157
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,720
that all agreed to a embargo about two

158
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,240
weeks later that broke 70 plus stories

159
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,340
published in a day she testified in from

160
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,520
the UK she testified in front of the EU

161
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,740
and fast forward April 2022 and the EU

162
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,380
passes to Digital Services act which

163
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,479
felt like a big win and certainly for

164
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,419
her mind because we had put a

165
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,240
huge amount of effort into making sure

166
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,940
that we immediately went to to Europe to

167
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,460
kind of push forward that legislation

168
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,979
um which you know whether you agree with

169
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,639
it or disagree with it it is a a massive

170
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,099
step into in terms of transparency and

171
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,160
accountability in this space

172
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,180
okay

173
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,900
so some fun facts and important strategy

174
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,940
um as I said so the journal reported

175
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,759
first and they did a brilliant job but

176
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,479
20 000 pages of of uh documents meant

177
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,539
and and you know focusing from things

178
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:02,160
like Myanmar to human trafficking to oh

179
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
like it just wasn't enough for one

180
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
publication

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,419
um so we uh really tried to help

182
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,599
coordinate a multitude of sources

183
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,880
um of journalists to be able to view the

184
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,740
documents and report on them

185
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,240
secondly

186
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,560
we did all this I never saw the

187
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,639
documents I've still never seen the

188
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,199
documents except for the ones that are

189
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,280
public

190
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,259
um never had them never touched them all

191
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:29,039
of that was so all of this was done

192
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,620
um taking a lot of shanna's advice which

193
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,020
is you know being very careful uh and

194
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,539
making sure that that we weren't

195
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,399
unnecessarily putting more people at

196
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,479
risk

197
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,559
um

198
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,539
and lastly I think I always think this

199
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,219
is kind of fun to remind people because

200
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,380
now I feel like people think Francis is

201
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,420
like everywhere

202
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,580
um we very intentionally she did not do

203
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,220
another TV interview in the United

204
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,519
States for almost over three months

205
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,880
after her public reveal

206
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,480
and I bring that up because

207
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,060
that is that choice

208
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,620
was not because there wasn't demand I

209
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,540
mean everyone wanted her but between the

210
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,700
six hours of video testimony that the

211
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,800
um everyone had access to

212
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,279
60 Minutes a bevy of Stories being

213
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,080
written and just a kind of risk

214
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,839
assessment of what is the biggest risk

215
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,920
especially for a woman to come out

216
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,140
is to be personally attacked right and

217
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,600
so reducing the surface area of the

218
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,640
amount of personal attacks and that

219
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,980
could be done against her was

220
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,680
intentional and

221
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,740
um was a was it was a was one of our

222
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,959
goals and the documents spoke for

223
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:49,920
themselves

224
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
this wasn't like if Francis came to me

225
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,899
and said my goal is I want to be a

226
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,160
celebrity

227
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,779
first of all I'd be like there's a much

228
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:01,140
easier way to do that than this

229
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,740
um

230
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,800
but that wasn't the goal right

231
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,560
the goal was massive systemic change and

232
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,440
actually the kind of more that we've put

233
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,480
out about her I think the less we would

234
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,240
have been able to achieve that

235
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,160
um so we didn't do any TV

236
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,959
okay this was mostly for me but if

237
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,100
anyone else

238
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,080
needs a break like

239
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,180
feel free let's see how we doing here on

240
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,800
time okay great

241
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,760
okay so I want to move on if you guys

242
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,560
have questions about that part great we

243
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
can get there later

244
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,100
um but I want to move on in and and kind

245
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,500
of take this up a level and to people

246
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,080
who you know perhaps

247
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,420
at some point you will be faced with the

248
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,160
incredibly difficult decision to decide

249
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,959
to become a whistleblower or not

250
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,079
and I say this because having had many

251
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,519
conversations and working with people

252
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,920
that are in this it is a lonely and

253
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,260
often brutal decision

254
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,660
and the first thing that I want you to

255
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,620
notice that you don't have to be Francis

256
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,660
Hogan

257
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,220
you don't have to be Mudge you don't

258
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,899
have to be Edward Snowden and this is my

259
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,579
friend Naomi she was a whistleblower

260
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,980
against uh the Eric Garcetti in Los

261
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,200
Angeles but she was very public about it

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,060
you don't have to be her either

263
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,660
um

264
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,540
there are hundreds and potentially

265
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,300
probably thousands of private

266
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,579
whistleblowers who you don't know the

267
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,540
names of and they've achieved their goal

268
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,720
hopefully many of them without

269
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,579
becoming a face of the of the process

270
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:36,899
now

271
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,839
the thing about that is that

272
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,300
you have to ask yourself what is the

273
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,940
goal of your whistleblowing

274
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,500
because it's not going to be fun

275
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,480
regardless

276
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,440
and if your goal is to document events

277
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,760
and timeline

278
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,220
or to for personal accountability

279
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,800
reasons it's very likely that you can do

280
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,800
that without being public

281
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,860
if your goal is massive public pressure

282
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,720
and Regulatory change

283
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,700
that's going to be real hard to do

284
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,839
without being out in the world

285
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,540
and so understanding kind of what is the

286
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,880
point of your personal of you feeling

287
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,380
compelled to

288
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,779
you know say Your Truth

289
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,880
will hopefully help guide you and kind

290
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,200
of how public you need to be in this

291
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,480
process

292
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,660
um the the the Francis originally did

293
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,360
not want to be public ironic now that

294
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,320
you know she's very public but I

295
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,019
but she did want massive regulatory

296
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:40,860
change

297
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,920
and her legal

298
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,639
um

299
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,860
her lawyers were very

300
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,079
smart to advise her and said every

301
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,519
single time

302
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,860
you meet with the senator

303
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,500
you meet with the SEC you meet with a

304
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,240
member of the House

305
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,740
that

306
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,639
locus of trust that you have to have

307
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,839
grows exponentially

308
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,720
the likelihood of your identity being

309
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,660
leaked Without You owning that narrative

310
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,079
without you choosing

311
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,079
grows exponentially so if you want to be

312
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,540
in those conversations and you want to

313
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,740
be explaining your version of the truth

314
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,899
my recommendation is that you do it very

315
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,519
publicly and you try and just own it

316
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,959
from the beginning

317
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,459
because the worst case scenario is that

318
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,079
someone leaks it when you didn't want to

319
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,820
do it and then you don't you've you've

320
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,899
lost kind of both things

321
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,459
um you all play on the internet

322
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,040
you also have to just assess like how

323
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,660
comfortable are you with being a public

324
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,820
persona

325
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,100
because you're not not everyone is going

326
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,880
to be on your side about this and

327
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,220
that is an unfortunate truth of this

328
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,139
process

329
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,660
okay so let's say you're like I gotta do

330
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,120
it where do I begin

331
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,200
um

332
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,180
they're kind of like three key players

333
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,579
I'm like by Far and Away the least

334
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,399
important in this list is PR

335
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,260
but the journalists and Publications

336
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,120
that you choose to work with hugely

337
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,380
important I know Harlow is going to

338
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,740
speak next and can kind of give a lot

339
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,440
more insight into a

340
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,139
kind of what tools you have at your

341
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,579
disposal and kind of how you can be

342
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,880
smart about working with a publication

343
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,779
secondly is

344
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,000
um legal counsel that you trust and

345
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
lastly is you know a team of PR people

346
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,660
but just professionals that you want who

347
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,000
have been in the trenches before who

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,279
have done big public profiles before and

349
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,260
you trust to to

350
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,480
uh with your reputation

351
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,060
so that's and we are by far the least

352
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,860
important

353
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,920
I wish I wasn't true but it was

354
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,300
um okay there's a little question should

355
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,040
I get a lawyer my answer

356
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,560
probs

357
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,940
um and so if you're thinking like

358
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,500
whoopsie

359
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,779
wait I've already started this

360
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,240
um that's okay I don't think you need to

361
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,740
get a lawyer anytime you're taught like

362
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,139
if you're talking to a journalist about

363
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,360
a single story something like that like

364
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,519
you know you're probably gonna be fine

365
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,620
but in general

366
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,880
here are some folks that I've worked

367
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,800
with there are so many incredible

368
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,360
organizations but I want to point out

369
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,980
the top two in particular was the

370
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,420
blu-rayed and signals Network they are

371
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,940
non-profit organizations that are

372
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,120
dedicated to providing resources and

373
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,040
sometimes those resources don't come in

374
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,560
the form of legal sometimes their

375
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,459
personal security or a shoulder to lean

376
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:39,360
on

377
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,980
um but just letting you know that

378
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,360
there's an ecosystem of folks

379
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,240
Constantine Canada is a legal and they

380
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,980
they specialize in with whistleblower

381
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,139
Communications or Law Firm

382
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:49,800
um

383
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,079
but there are people that you that know

384
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,120
this space and know this world and you

385
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,800
don't have to be quite as alone in this

386
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,339
process with

387
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,160
am I doing on time here

388
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,920
I'm here next selecting a journalist in

389
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,540
publication I mean Francis was very

390
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,279
intentional about

391
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,399
working with the journal and

392
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,600
um

393
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,720
the point of that was she was her one of

394
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,940
her primary concerns was that this

395
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,360
becomes a very like kind of left-leaning

396
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,540
um conversation quickly and so working

397
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,000
with a right-leaning publication was

398
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,839
important

399
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,920
um but like these are Basics but I'm

400
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,120
just gonna say them

401
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,339
you want to trust the journalists that

402
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,079
you're working with because

403
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,899
your goals and their goals are not

404
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,880
necessarily aligned

405
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,139
like

406
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,500
journalism is a it's this is this is a

407
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,300
pay-to-play like game they're looking

408
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
for clicks they're looking for the

409
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,660
juiciest story you don't get to write

410
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,779
that story so if you send over some some

411
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,220
information and you think it's very

412
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,899
obvious that they should understand what

413
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,160
the story is out of that you're probably

414
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,660
wrong

415
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,220
um because not many people are living

416
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,720
and breathing in the same kind of

417
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,459
ecosystem that you are

418
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:09,059
and so building a relationship first and

419
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,299
making sure that you trust that person

420
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,119
is incredibly important because oh this

421
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,699
entire process is

422
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:18,780
um

423
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,720
you know you're you're very exposed

424
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,059
um read their work

425
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,799
think about the audience that you're

426
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,919
trying to reach are you trying to reach

427
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,780
Tech Insiders

428
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,299
and you only care about others see like

429
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,419
people in security and privacy well then

430
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:37,799
maybe the New York Times isn't the right

431
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,320
place and you don't have to do that if

432
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,179
you're trying to reach media Elite there

433
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,340
isn't anyone with a bigger reach than

434
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,980
the New York Times so you know those are

435
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,600
the types of decisions you can make but

436
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,340
first and foremost you need to trust the

437
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,039
person who you're communicating with

438
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,480
okay and this is where I get to like

439
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,600
hopefully teach something now how many

440
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,100
people in this room and I promise I

441
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,679
won't tattle on you um have spoken with

442
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,919
a journalist before

443
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,880
great

444
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,140
um how many people are familiar with

445
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,840
kind of conversation status and have

446
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,660
like successfully negotiated going back

447
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,940
and forth between statuses all right

448
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,200
there you go Mel

449
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,660
um okay this is my like fun comms 101

450
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,940
for everyone there are kind of three

451
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,620
primary statuses when you're talking to

452
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,820
a reporter

453
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,720
off the record on the record and on

454
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,799
background

455
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,660
let me start with the one that is like

456
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,320
the most uh quote unquote safe is

457
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,780
probably the wrong word but off the

458
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,280
Record means that they can't attribute

459
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,140
anything to you it means you're giving

460
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,600
them kind of insight and kind of context

461
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,760
perhaps that they could use in further

462
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,580
conversations but they you are not they

463
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,919
are not allowed to mention you or a

464
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,360
description of you or that you're at the

465
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,460
company there's none of that

466
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,200
on background

467
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,960
is kind of the next next phase

468
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,179
and on background is a little tricky you

469
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:04,919
need to negotiate with the person what

470
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,720
on background means but when you read

471
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,960
things that say a spoke or a person

472
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,059
inside the company says

473
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,679
and it's not their name

474
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,900
they were on background

475
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,059
um they can't it's also known as not for

476
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,220
attribution they can't quote you

477
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,960
directly

478
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,059
um but they may be able to describe the

479
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:26,280
circumstance or describe kind of who you

480
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,039
are and you can be specific about how

481
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,500
you want to be described

482
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,240
um on the record

483
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,400
is the default status for all of your

484
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,100
Communications with a reporter

485
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,640
when in doubt you're on the record

486
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,520
um they can say your name your title

487
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,220
exactly what you said

488
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,100
um when speaking with you

489
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,559
and this highlighted green box at the

490
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,720
bottom please note

491
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,059
status must be agreed upon mutually

492
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,280
agreed upon before the conversation

493
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,780
starts

494
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,080
so if you send a note to someone an

495
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,940
email this is my favorite and by the way

496
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,220
comms people do this all the time and um

497
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,200
and then get in trouble for it well

498
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,480
they'll send a uh like subject line off

499
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,200
the record and then send a statement or

500
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,840
on background in a statement and they

501
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,280
never agreed to that you have to

502
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,919
mutually agree before the conversation

503
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,799
starts and people get themselves in so

504
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,679
in so much trouble there's like a great

505
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:29,940
um

506
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,160
I think it was like

507
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,020
oh so I'm gonna mess it up some

508
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,140
presidential candidate uh like was

509
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,660
talking smack in the in a van and then

510
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,340
was like oh but that part's on

511
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,220
background

512
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,780
you don't get you you have to agree to

513
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,059
this ahead of time now look you guys are

514
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,100
like like journalist dreams because you

515
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
hold all sorts of like juicy information

516
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,380
and no company secrets and all of these

517
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,460
things so they're going to be a lot more

518
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,080
flexible with you about these

519
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,740
conversations than let's say me but

520
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,520
um

521
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,100
this is just so helpful to know because

522
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,500
when in doubt you were on the record

523
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,340
and uh

524
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,900
it just will save you so much time and

525
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,620
angst if you uh can can know from the

526
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,660
beginning like happy to chat with you

527
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,280
but it's going to be off the Record or

528
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,960
it's going to be on background and go

529
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,640
from there

530
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,480
um okay and then lastly

531
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,520
my I did this with all of my clients and

532
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,780
I'm leaving you with this in case you

533
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,700
want to do it for your next meeting with

534
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,700
your CEO or you want your your next time

535
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,039
you blow the whistle or your next big

536
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,419
presentation

537
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,159
um but what is your core message and

538
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,159
this is a a kind of tool we use in order

539
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,679
to it's called a messaging triangle in

540
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,640
order to help people distill down uh

541
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,080
what their primary messages so when I

542
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,020
asked Francis the first time uh you know

543
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,240
kind of what happened like why she did

544
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,460
this it was she spoke for 18 and a half

545
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,380
minutes straight and I was like cool

546
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,260
cool that's terrifying and also

547
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,360
let's we're gonna get to 90 seconds girl

548
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,539
like we're gonna get there quick so

549
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,240
um and we used this type of framework to

550
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,799
get there right so you're asking

551
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,440
yourself what is the problem

552
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,720
what is the result that happens because

553
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,520
of that problem and what is the proposed

554
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,500
solution and if you can answer that

555
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,600
you'll end up with like here's the

556
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,159
headline that I want this this

557
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,600
journalist to write here's the headline

558
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,320
that I'm seeking to have and end up with

559
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,960
a much cleaner landed story than you've

560
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,659
ever thought of before

561
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:42,120
um okay I hope none of you ever have to

562
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,799
blow the whistle but if you do do it

563
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:44,520
well

564
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,120
good luck
