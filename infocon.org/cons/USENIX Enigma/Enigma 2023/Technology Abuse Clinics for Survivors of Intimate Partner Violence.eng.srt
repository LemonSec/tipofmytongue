1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,759
hi everyone

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,960
um today I'll be talking about

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
technology abuse clinics which are

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,039
places where survivors of intimate

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,720
partner violence can come to receive

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,520
help when they are being harmed by

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,920
technology and in this talk I'll also be

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,720
introducing a toolkit for people who

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,699
might be interested in starting a clinic

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,080
like the ones that I'm going to be

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,940
talking about today

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,100
but before I talk about the clinics I

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,540
wanted to give some context and

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,280
background on intimate partner violence

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,800
and what it is as a problem

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,440
in the United States intimate partner

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,620
violence or ipv is considered a public

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,840
health problem with the CDC estimating

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,120
that one in four women and one in ten

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,980
men experience severe violence from an

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,500
intimate partner in their lifetimes

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,480
as often happens it is even more

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,860
pronounced in communities that are

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,360
already marginalized or already

26
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,120
vulnerable with over half of indigenous

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,700
black and bisexual women reporting that

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,140
they experience severe intimate partner

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,240
violence as well as over half of trans

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,000
and non-binary people

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,159
so what is intimate partner violence and

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
how do we Define it

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
it turns out that this is a little bit

34
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,860
more complicated a little bit less

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,020
straightforward and a lot more political

36
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,759
than you might think it is

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,860
and to explain what I mean by that I

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,540
wanted to take everyone on a detour

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,700
through how one United States Federal

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,700
agency has changed its definition

41
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,400
over the past five years so this is a

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,439
federal agency that's job is to respond

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,659
to intimate partner violence and five

44
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,579
years ago it would have to find an

45
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,439
intimate partner violence as a pattern

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,079
of abusive Behavior used by one partner

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,700
to maintain power and control over

48
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,340
another using means that can be physical

49
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,579
and sexual but also emotional economic

50
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,500
or psychological

51
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,020
and this is what experts call coercive

52
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,720
control it's a definition that Advocates

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,360
and experts stand behind because it

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,540
understands ipv as not just a single

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,660
event or an isolated incident but a

56
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,700
whole complex set of behaviors that are

57
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,160
underpinned by the threat of violence

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,900
and this is really important for

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,879
survivors because it means that we can

60
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,520
understand forms of abuse and coercion

61
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,860
that aren't just physical or sexual

62
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,500
and we can also respond to it and help

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,360
them holistically outside of those

64
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,780
moments

65
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,480
but a year later this definition would

66
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,680
have appeared if you went to the same

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,720
website and why this change happened

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
really had more to do with who happened

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,280
to be in office it happened to do more

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,599
with who's in charge of this Federal

71
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,580
agency and you can make your own

72
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,680
assumptions about who that was or why it

73
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,540
happened but ultimately what the change

74
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,080
was was that it defined ipv as felony or

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,420
misdemeanor crimes of violence

76
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,420
and this definition gets wrong what all

77
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,739
of the things that the previous

78
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,440
definition got right it is defining it

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,080
as crimes as an incident or an event and

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,180
it's in doing so it's stripping away all

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,920
of the context and narrative that comes

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,780
behind that

83
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,900
what that means is that if someone is

84
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,819
experiencing forms of coercion like

85
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,099
their partner is monitoring them 24 7

86
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,959
tracking their location without their

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,700
knowledge preventing them from talking

88
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,319
to their friends or family or even

89
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,540
draining their shared bank accounts none

90
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,280
of that would be considered part of a

91
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,620
pattern of domestic abuse or intimate

92
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,379
partner violence

93
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,940
that wasn't the end of this change

94
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,560
though because

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,019
um now at as of the time of writing of

96
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:38,879
this talk if you go back to the same

97
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,620
Federal agency you'll find a new

98
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,140
definition and it's a lot closer to the

99
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,360
first one which was a lot better in my

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,819
opinion but one big change that happened

101
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,400
was that it now recognized that coercive

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
control can be technological

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,560
and that was a big win for people who

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,540
were working in advocacy for survivors

105
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,519
for anyone who studied technology abuse

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,040
because ever since caller ID and GPS

107
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,080
became part of our Lives we've known

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,299
that digital Technologies can be used by

109
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,819
abusers to harm or track their victims

110
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,920
and that's only become more complicated

111
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,958
and more prevalent as technology has

112
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,279
so why am I telling you all of this why

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,899
not just start with that definition that

114
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,339
was pretty good and went straight to

115
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,899
technology

116
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,600
and the reason why I wanted to talk

117
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,880
about this is because definitions can

118
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,460
change over time yes but they don't

119
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,860
always change for the better and they

120
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,720
have real consequences for survivors

121
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,120
because how we Define something tells us

122
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,860
how we understand it and how we

123
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,960
understand it changes how we respond to

124
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,860
it

125
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,020
and that means that since these

126
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,360
definitions have outsized impacts on

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,699
survivors that they should be based in

128
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,860
their lived experiences and good

129
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,380
Evolutions change in the definitions

130
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,300
reflect changes in their lived

131
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,040
experiences in the reality that they

132
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,979
live in and bad definitions ignore those

133
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,759
narratives or don't seek them out

134
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,680
and I think that this is the real value

135
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,479
of Technology abuse clinics and what's

136
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,699
so powerful for about them

137
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,580
technology abuse clinics in one sense

138
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,520
they create places where survivors can

139
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,259
share their narratives of Technology

140
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,840
abuse and not with just anyone but with

141
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,419
people who have the power or a best

142
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,280
positioned to actually change those

143
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,039
platforms for better long-term change or

144
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,080
help create public policy

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,820
and we're not just doing it in a way

146
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,280
where we helicopter in and then leave or

147
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,919
just interview them and and walk away we

148
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,539
can actually offer them short-term help

149
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,039
with the problems that they're currently

150
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,020
facing while we learn those narratives

151
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,120
and I think that this makes us better

152
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,280
Engineers better designers better

153
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,259
privacy and Security Experts when we can

154
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,620
do this

155
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,560
so what kind of help do we actually give

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,419
to clients who come into the technology

157
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,340
abuse clinics that we run

158
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,500
um I currently run one in New York City

159
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,840
called The Clinic to end Tech abuse and

160
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,220
I've been doing this for a couple years

161
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,840
I've worked with

162
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,900
um over 100 survivors I can say that

163
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,759
most of the help that we give is not

164
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,860
very sophisticated

165
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,500
it's often things that are considered

166
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,259
relatively mundane like reviewing

167
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,360
account settings or changing passwords

168
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,539
looking at login histories it's a lot

169
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,759
less of the spyware that people tend to

170
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,139
imagine

171
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,780
and when I tell people this

172
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,880
I often hear the same question

173
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,039
and that question is

174
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,199
is helping people reset their passwords

175
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,020
really the best use of your time

176
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,880
and I think that when people ask me this

177
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,160
they mean well what they mean is why

178
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,780
don't you have someone else do this with

179
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,919
them and they can tell you about it

180
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,259
later or or give you a report of what

181
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,479
happened and then you as someone with an

182
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,940
advanced degree in computer science or

183
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,740
someone with specialized skills you can

184
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,539
go change the platforms and make this

185
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,280
bigger impact change

186
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,199
and my answer to this question is always

187
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,819
yes

188
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,380
um I do think that this is the best use

189
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,060
of my time and I think that it makes me

190
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,860
a better engineer and a better designer

191
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,900
for doing it

192
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,220
um

193
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,919
much like trying to understand intimate

194
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,319
partner violence as an isolated incident

195
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,840
or a single event we can't capture

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,759
technology abuse with a series of

197
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,160
reported incidents or help tickets and

198
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,780
we would make the same mistake if we did

199
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,240
because we need to be able to understand

200
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,220
what is happening within its larger

201
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,580
narrative

202
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,740
one example of this is this snippet of

203
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,020
an interview with a Survivor who said

204
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,819
I wrote down things that were happening

205
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,639
altercations and I had evidence

206
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
he told me that he needed to update the

207
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,639
device

208
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,319
he took the phone forced the password

209
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,240
out of me and he deleted my journal

210
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,380
what is striking to me about this is

211
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,660
that if you just viewed this as a

212
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,639
technical event it's nothing remarkable

213
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,500
it's someone's phone got taken from them

214
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,139
and some information got deleted

215
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,639
um if you just look at it at the actions

216
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,020
that we would take with them it's also

217
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,360
not that interesting we are really just

218
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,860
helping someone secure their device

219
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,860
better or trying to look for a backup

220
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,900
but when you hear the whole story we can

221
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,400
start to ask more interesting questions

222
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,740
like how can we as people who design

223
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,900
technology platforms

224
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,720
help survivors navigate the twin needs

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
that they have to both gather the

226
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,319
evidence that they need to pursue legal

227
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,599
protections while still keeping

228
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,160
themselves safe from the people who are

229
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,419
harming them

230
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,520
and doing this we can also start to do

231
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,900
things like build threat models for

232
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,760
intimate partner violence like we can

233
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,559
see coercive access as part of the

234
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,179
threat model that might not happen in

235
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:39,179
other situations we can also identify

236
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,880
other needs like preserving evidence

237
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,820
and

238
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,560
ultimately I think that understanding

239
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,420
this narrative the stakes the

240
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,399
motivations that are at play they help

241
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,839
us think about tech platforms as

242
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,160
something that interacts with people

243
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,800
with legal systems and with complicated

244
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,939
relational Dynamics

245
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,120
So to that end there's been some

246
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
research that has done a systematic

247
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,600
analysis of how technology abuse happens

248
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
and has come up with a taxonomy of what

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,920
that looks like

250
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,839
but in the spirit of honoring narratives

251
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:14,880
I wanted to just talk about what I have

252
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
seen in the past couple years working

253
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,279
with clients

254
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,019
I have worked with clients who came to

255
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,860
me

256
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,120
um saying that they had taken their car

257
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,000
to a mechanic and tried had it basically

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,620
searched all over torn the car apart

259
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,300
because they got an alert that there was

260
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,980
an air tag following them but they were

261
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,680
never able to find it

262
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,160
I've worked with clients who wanted to

263
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,019
exit a phone contract that was owned by

264
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,180
their abuser but they were too afraid to

265
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,740
do that because the first time that they

266
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,540
called the phone company the phone

267
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,940
company's three-way dialed in the abuser

268
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,720
without telling them

269
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,380
just as they had um finally left this

270
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,940
person

271
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,720
I've also spoken with multiple clients

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,420
who came to us asking if we could help

273
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,580
them find a single shred of evidence a

274
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,620
text message a photograph a call log

275
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,300
that showed that they had ever

276
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,160
electronically communicated with someone

277
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,600
that they had been in a relationship

278
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,480
with for over a decade and we were

279
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,399
unable to find anything because the

280
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,720
amount of coercive control of their

281
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,940
abuser had over their technology was so

282
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,260
complete that they were able to remove

283
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,600
all of it

284
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,760
one client that I worked with was still

285
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,640
living with her abuser and she told us

286
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
that her abuser was using Bluetooth

287
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,860
devices to harass her while they he was

288
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,380
at work so during the summer in New York

289
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,519
he would turn on and off the air

290
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,500
conditioning turn on and off the

291
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,480
internet turn on and off the lights when

292
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,220
she entered and exited a room just to

293
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,480
let her know that he could see that that

294
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,399
was happening

295
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,560
I've also spoken with multiple clients

296
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,720
who had lost the accounts that they

297
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,760
needed for public housing applications

298
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,579
for health care to run their personal

299
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,359
businesses

300
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,339
and I wanted to go through all of these

301
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,440
stories because I wanted everyone to

302
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,940
understand something

303
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,920
there are real Stakes here for people

304
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,200
and those Stakes include physical danger

305
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,240
that can mean death when it comes to

306
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,800
intimate partner violence

307
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,360
it can also be financially and

308
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,980
economically devastating you can lose

309
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,959
your job because of this harassment you

310
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,600
can lose your housing you can lose your

311
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,220
entire identity financially

312
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,779
but people tend to underestimate the

313
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:30,000
psychological and emotional Devastation

314
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,100
that technology abuse can happen and

315
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,600
this is something that I hear time and

316
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,760
time again when I'm working with clients

317
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,459
is that technology is so ubiquitous and

318
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,200
sometimes so unexpected in the places

319
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,620
you find it that they say that it feels

320
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,620
like it's coming from everywhere

321
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,839
and because technology is capable of

322
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,120
giving us this digital record that looks

323
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,820
so factual and real but is also so easy

324
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,640
to manipulate it starts to cause people

325
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,820
to question their own sanity

326
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,800
and these are people who are

327
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
experiencing a real attack in real

328
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,660
danger it's not just something that is

329
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,899
it's not like they are um

330
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,700
it's not like they don't have a reason

331
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,560
to fare for their own safety or to fair

332
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,120
that these things are happening because

333
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,860
they have proof that it actually is they

334
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,360
know that it is there is someone who's

335
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,940
actually out to get them

336
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,240
the good news is that working with

337
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,100
survivors and Clinics we've been able to

338
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,500
do entry and exit interviews and what

339
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,880
we've found is that these are actually

340
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,860
really positive corrective experiences

341
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,420
for the clients that we see and that we

342
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,800
work with

343
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,420
so a lot of the clients that we work

344
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,459
with report saying that they now have a

345
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,839
better understanding of how technology

346
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,579
can be used to harm them how they can

347
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,860
keep themselves safe

348
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,240
um and I would say that our biggest

349
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,459
problem as a technology abuse Clinic is

350
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,959
that we can't meet the demand for

351
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,940
everyone who wants our services

352
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,620
in fact these are the only three

353
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,300
technology abuse clinics that I know of

354
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,700
that exists and we can barely meet the

355
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,500
demand in our local communities let

356
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,899
alone the entire country or the world

357
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,519
and so I would say that what we need

358
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,380
more than anything is a network of

359
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,000
Technology abuse clinics that can help

360
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,800
people in their local communities but

361
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,899
that can work together to share

362
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,839
resources share experiences advocate for

363
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,360
Public Policy together

364
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,279
and doing that is something that I think

365
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,420
is really hard for one reason which is

366
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,459
that technology abuse clinics are hard

367
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,139
to run and I do know this from

368
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,639
experience and they are also really a

369
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,860
hard or daunting to figure out how to

370
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,180
get them started or off the ground and

371
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,980
so this was why we created this

372
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,019
technology abuse Clinic toolkit

373
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,139
now what is actually in this toolkit is

374
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,180
a lot of practical advice Collective

375
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,339
advice from what we have learned over

376
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,959
the past few years at our existing

377
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,760
clinics

378
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,700
um and that goes through a lot of

379
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,560
um all of the moving parts that we work

380
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,120
with on a day-to-day basis from

381
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
recruiting and training staff to how to

382
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,380
actually run a session with clients

383
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,160
um

384
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,720
but I think what's more interesting is

385
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,240
what's not in this toolkit which is the

386
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,860
best or the only way to run a technology

387
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,120
abuse Clinic

388
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,160
intimate partner violence isn't the only

389
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,440
relational Dynamic that can make people

390
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,839
vulnerable and so other clinics can

391
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,300
explore those Dynamics there's also a

392
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,160
lot of other possible service models and

393
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,260
funding structures that we haven't tried

394
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,940
or um

395
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,339
or even thought of and so I think that

396
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,260
being able to have Innovation is really

397
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,120
important

398
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,160
in fact I would say that almost every

399
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,200
aspect of the technology abuse clinics

400
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,120
is Up For Debate you're welcome to try

401
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,220
and innovate on every single on pretty

402
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,980
much every single way that we operate

403
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,019
which kind of begs the question of what

404
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,519
makes something actually a technology

405
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,320
abuse Clinic what is it about them that

406
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,420
actually lets us get these stories in

407
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,800
this exchange with people while

408
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,660
providing help in a way that's safe for

409
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,279
both them and for us

410
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,500
and what I've landed on is that there's

411
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,240
three features that really make this

412
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,519
that make a technology abuse Clinic what

413
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,560
it is and that is that they are trauma

414
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,360
informed and community-based services

415
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,160
and that they're delivered in a clinical

416
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,240
setting

417
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,040
and I wanted to run through what each of

418
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,540
those pieces mean

419
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,100
um briefly

420
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,019
and the first being trauma-informed care

421
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,220
so people who are in vulnerable

422
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,139
situations they have often experienced

423
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,820
events that might be that might be

424
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,800
traumatic and we want to create a place

425
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,480
where they can get care from us in a way

426
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,880
that is safe and respectful of what they

427
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,680
have experienced

428
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,420
um the main thing of what that means is

429
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,699
to work with Advocates and experts who

430
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,500
already do this work to work with social

431
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,019
workers to work with all of the people

432
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,760
who are already on the front lines with

433
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,440
vulnerable populations and meet them

434
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,420
where they are

435
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,680
um it takes training to really

436
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,779
understand how to do this properly and

437
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,459
nothing can replace

438
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,860
um hiring someone to train you in this

439
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,959
it also means from a technical expected

440
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,839
perspective that we want to you know

441
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,279
recognize the client's individual

442
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,639
situation so there's a risk of violence

443
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,320
from an abuser and what we want to do is

444
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,779
be able to acknowledge when any change

445
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,760
that we make might alert the abuser send

446
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,199
them a notification and work with them

447
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,360
to maintain their safety we want to

448
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,800
educate them and meet them where they're

449
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,480
at to not just tell them to use signal

450
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,519
if it's going to if that's not going to

451
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,380
meaningfully enhance their protection

452
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,820
from their abuser

453
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,740
and really just let clients Drive the

454
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,940
sessions of what they're trying to

455
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,839
accomplish and help them along the way

456
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,220
the second thing is that they are

457
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,440
Community Based and this is also

458
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,820
something that ties in with being

459
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,740
trauma-informed because being Community

460
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,019
Based or embedded in a community means

461
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,220
that you can work with the local

462
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,899
agencies that are already doing this

463
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:29,279
work there

464
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,899
it's also really important because it

465
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,000
helps us understand political and

466
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,220
cultural geographies that are specific

467
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,899
to and shape the ways that people might

468
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,519
experience Tech abuse

469
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,160
so in New York City where people rely on

470
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,680
public transit we might not have the

471
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,779
best idea of how people track vehicles

472
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,060
in ipv which would be more obvious

473
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,639
somewhere where people use cars uh you

474
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,300
need to understand in a local community

475
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,160
what technology people use how they use

476
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,680
it what help is available to them how

477
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,540
they travel to get to that help what

478
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,220
languages they have if there are

479
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,380
specific laws that protect them and

480
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,400
whether there are certain communities

481
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,199
who have a bad relationship with law

482
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,280
enforcement

483
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,780
and that's something that you can only

484
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,939
really understand by living in and

485
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,699
working with that population

486
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,099
and then the last bit is that it is a

487
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,720
clinical setting and so this is very

488
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,520
similar to things like legal clinics

489
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,079
where legal experts can work with

490
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,699
vulnerable populations who are under

491
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,220
resourced and give them expert legal

492
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,980
advice pro bono and this means that

493
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,260
survivors gain access to experts which

494
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,640
is really helpful because there's a lot

495
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,740
of misinformation and lies out there and

496
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,299
just being able to clear that up with

497
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:37,919
them is something that is helpful in and

498
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,240
of itself

499
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,220
it also means that it can create a place

500
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,140
where experts can do this for medium to

501
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,299
low commitment most of our volunteers do

502
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,160
have full-time jobs and we ask them to

503
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,020
commit about 10 to 15 hours a month

504
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,780
working with survivors

505
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,980
um which means that this is something

506
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,660
that people can do in tandem with their

507
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,640
job with their existing jobs working on

508
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,500
platforms and all of the other things

509
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,000
that people think of when they think of

510
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,220
making broad systemic changes

511
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,200
so on that note

512
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,900
um I was just wanted to end by repeating

513
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,700
what I've been trying to say which is

514
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,140
that clinics help us really understand

515
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,539
the narratives of Technology abuse in a

516
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,280
way that helps us shape public policy

517
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,620
and build better technology platforms

518
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,480
and if this is something that you think

519
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,460
that is you are interested in and that

520
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,539
you might want to learn more about

521
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,940
starting we desperately need people to

522
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,160
do that

523
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,020
um and I wanted to leave everyone with a

524
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,299
couple of resource links one of them is

525
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,100
that you can find the toolkit at the

526
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,799
cedo website and also if you are someone

527
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,419
that you know is experiencing intimate

528
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,460
partner violence then there are a lot of

529
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,440
resources available to talk about safety

530
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,059
and possible resources at the

531
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,679
hotline.org

532
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,090
thanks

533
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,530
