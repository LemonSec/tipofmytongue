1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,420
yeah thank you good morning everybody

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,160
thanks for coming out to Santa Clara

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,740
this is my home turf so it's delayed I'm

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,420
delighted to see you here

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,160
um and today I'm going to talk about a

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,720
project that I'm working on it's fairly

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,220
early stage and so I'm looking forward

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,800
to your reactions and comments and

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,239
questions so that I can continue to

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,239
iterate it the project is called uh net

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,399
benefit how the internet improves

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,680
humanity and it actually is as bold as

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,940
it sounds and I'm going to make my case

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,860
to you about why I think we can support

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,840
this and what its policy implications

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,219
are

18
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,660
um let me just start with doing a quick

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,760
uh mind check where people's heads are

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,739
at um if I were to ask you to describe

21
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,199
the internet in one meme or a gift shout

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,360
out where your head might be at what are

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,800
you thinking about

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,100
wait does someone say dumpster fire now

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,339
I need to point out I need to point out

26
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:07,799
that this is a not a plan but it is

27
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,299
someone who knows me very well because

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,460
she suffered through one of my classes

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,170
laughs

30
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,460
[Music]

31
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,240
the dumpster fire

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,299
so look this is pretty basic right this

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,439
is what we think about we think about

34
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,420
the internet we instantly go negative we

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,979
instantly think about all the problems I

36
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,060
believe some of the speakers are coming

37
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,040
out to me are going to continue to add

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,140
fuel to this dumpster fire I'm coming

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,299
from a completely different place

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,380
um sorry I'm going to skip this slide

41
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,920
I'm going to give you a thesis about my

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,420
project and then I'm going to give you

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,759
some support and evidence so my goal is

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,040
to explain how compared to the offline

45
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,920
Baseline user generated content can

46
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,920
improve the human species now obviously

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm going for some big stuff here I'm

48
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,100
talking about us as humans as you know

49
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,840
eight billion people all sharing the

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,820
same Planet I'm putting on the table

51
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,040
that I think we can be better and I'm

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,479
suggesting that there's a mechanism

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,799
that's going to help us get better and

54
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,560
that's user generated content that's us

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,899
talking to each other now in my title I

56
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,818
use the term internet now it actually

57
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,099
will be easier for me if I try to show

58
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,020
that the internet makes this better that

59
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,879
would pick up a bunch of things like all

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,680
these self-improvement apps that you can

61
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,560
download that actually make you better

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,879
but I'm actually not trying to reach

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,860
those I'm trying to reach the idea that

64
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,599
the way we talk to each other what we're

65
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,700
saying to each other can actually make

66
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,720
us better as a species but I have a huge

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,580
qualifier and that's this notion of

68
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,400
compared to the offline Baseline so I'm

69
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,800
not trying to say that we are going to

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,739
be good I'm simply going to say let me

71
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,840
take a snapshot of what humanity is like

72
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,019
in the offline world and then I'm going

73
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,200
to say can we do better than that using

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,420
the mechanisms of our conversations on

75
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,980
the internet

76
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,080
it's this last piece that I think often

77
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,120
gets forgotten this compared to the

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
offline Baseline we look at all the

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,019
anti-social things we do to each other

80
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,900
online and we assume that is the default

81
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,640
state of nature just we're terrible to

82
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,040
each other online but we're also

83
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,260
terrible to each other offline too and

84
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,060
that's the part that gets forgotten it's

85
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,879
not like we started out pristine doing

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
great stuff and then the internet

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,319
corrupted us we started out flawed and

88
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,180
we are still today let me try and model

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,860
this out for you

90
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,239
um I'm going to give you a stylized

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,580
model this is how economists Do It um so

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,319
like this is like a gross

93
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,940
oversimplification you want to tear this

94
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,980
apart that's fine I'm not going to argue

95
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,780
with you but just work with me for a

96
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,239
moment and model A construct let's take

97
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,739
for a moment this notion that there's

98
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,879
this offline Baseline a bad behavior in

99
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,540
society okay so I could reverse this I

100
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,519
could say there's good behavior and I

101
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,959
could reverse the model about how the

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
internet will actually Turbo Charge or

103
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,379
raise the good behavior but let's just

104
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,900
focus on the bad behavior piece of it

105
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,340
let's talk about

106
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,959
um the offline Baseline so I'm just

107
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,519
saying like there's a snapshot of

108
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,560
offline Baseline of course this is an

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,140
artificial construct right it sometimes

110
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,280
are better than each other than words

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
sometimes or uh you know in some

112
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,640
communities are good and other

113
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,900
communities are bad I'm just going to

114
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,360
pick a flat line and say let's just pick

115
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,400
a number and say that's what the offline

116
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,579
Baseline is so the typical analysis of

117
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,440
the internet and of History General

118
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
content has been that the that we exceed

119
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,479
that offline Baseline online that the

120
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,979
internet takes whatever is awful about

121
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,199
us and it turbo charges us that's what

122
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,880
the little clip art is here that has

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,160
taken us you know further than we would

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
normally go because of the affordances

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
of the internet

126
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,960
what I often uh have heard is maybe the

127
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,880
libertarian counter response is the

128
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,800
argument that the internet doesn't make

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,080
us worse it just shows us how terrible

130
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,600
we are it's a mirror that shows us or

131
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,979
illustrates us

132
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,320
um to us uh what we otherwise would

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,060
choose to ignore and so that's where the

134
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,800
monkey has taken to look itself and

135
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,540
shocked it's a monkey it didn't realize

136
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,040
there's a monkey only until it saw

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,900
itself in the in the mirror and so we

138
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,160
might say that the Internet is just that

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,720
mirror we're seeing things that we could

140
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,400
have otherwise ignored in physical space

141
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,020
we're seeing them when we're shocked by

142
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,940
what we see but they're not new they're

143
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,979
just things we never paid attention to

144
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,560
before now here's my argument here's my

145
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,259
goal is to show you actually that the

146
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,840
internet can make us below the offline

147
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,000
Baseline and that's where I got the slow

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,580
down thing it slows down our worst

149
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,380
Tendencies it actually gives us the

150
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,900
opportunity uh to uh do better than we

151
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,759
could have offline

152
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,220
so let me talk about how that could

153
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,120
happen

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,520
um so I just had this clip art of two

155
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,080
people talking each other in physical

156
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,340
space

157
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,680
um and there's a bunch of things that

158
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,199
are presumed or inferred from this

159
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,300
particular depiction that are not

160
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,880
expressly depicted in the photo we just

161
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,860
assume them the first obviously is that

162
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,940
they are able to get together in

163
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,199
physical space let's start with that

164
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,880
that's something that we can't take for

165
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,139
granted anymore

166
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,060
um but we assumed that there's a bunch

167
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,880
of cultural norms and social conventions

168
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,039
that are governing that conversation

169
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,960
they're not depicted in the photo we

170
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,479
just know they're there we also know

171
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,340
that there's a set of reputational

172
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,400
mechanisms sitting on this photo that if

173
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,500
one of the players in this conversation

174
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,900
engages in bad behavior in this

175
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,580
conversation the other person will think

176
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,740
less of them and so there's some

177
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,240
mechanisms that regulate this

178
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,460
conversation not the law they're just

179
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,020
built into the way that we talk to each

180
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,580
other

181
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,340
now the internet allows us to do the

182
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,780
same kind of thing we're having these

183
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,220
conversations but there's

184
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,220
a wire in the middle this thing called a

185
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,800
wire now I know that some of you are uh

186
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,960
Millennials maybe even we have some gen

187
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,340
Z in the room

188
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,020
um you're like what the heck is that

189
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,060
even depicting this is what we used to

190
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,180
call a like a home brew do-it-yourself

191
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,819
telephone system yeah take a wire and

192
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,160
you put two receivers at the end and you

193
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,680
could talk over some distance to each

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,880
other

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
um without actually using the telephone

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,120
system

197
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,680
um I don't know people still do this

198
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,020
anymore but as a model it reflects that

199
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,880
because there's that wire in the middle

200
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,800
there's now some new technological

201
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,840
capabilities and limitations that are

202
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,120
added and that's exactly what I'm

203
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,160
interested in what is the internet as

204
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,259
this mediator of this conversation going

205
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,240
from the upper left and going to the

206
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,220
bottom right by adding that wire in the

207
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,259
middle what are the things it allows it

208
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,900
to do and I'm going to give you

209
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,639
um I'm skipping my Star Trek example

210
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,380
that just kills me to do that in this

211
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,780
audience um but in the interest of time

212
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm going to give you a just an example

213
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
of how this works so remember there's

214
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
this wire in the middle that didn't

215
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
exist in the offline model that I showed

216
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,500
you the two people talking to each other

217
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,020
and that wire in the middle can do

218
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,460
things like what are sometimes called

219
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,880
civility props so the idea here is that

220
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,919
it's watching the conversations taking

221
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,080
place and it's like a good little angel

222
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,840
sitting on your shoulder and it says I

223
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,580
see that you're about to say something

224
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,340
that might be considered anti-social are

225
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,860
you sure you want to say that now I

226
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,300
don't have that in the offline World boy

227
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,860
I really need it there are plenty of

228
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,780
times that that good little angel could

229
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,340
save me from putting my foot in my mouth

230
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,340
but online you can have the wire

231
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,080
monitoring that conversation and

232
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,060
intervening in a way that can encourage

233
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,699
people to move towards more pro-social

234
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,500
Behavior than they might have achieved

235
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,479
without that intervention and perhaps

236
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,699
they might have achieved in the offline

237
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,900
world

238
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,139
so for example uh next door the local

239
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,300
social media uses

240
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,419
um uh technology like this to monitor uh

241
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,159
uh posts that are about to be made and

242
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,200
to suggest to some of those people what

243
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,700
you're saying might be considered racist

244
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,080
are you sure you want to say that or

245
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,520
what you're saying might be considered

246
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,620
anti-social are you are you sure you

247
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,020
want to say that and they found uh that

248
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,300
they could basically Reduce by a third

249
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,519
the total incidence of races or

250
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,920
antisocial Behavior just by having the

251
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,100
little angel on your shoulder pop up and

252
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,980
ask you to engage in nicer Behavior now

253
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,080
uh Twitter now this was pretty musk I

254
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,399
think we always have to say are we

255
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,380
talking pre or post musk Twitter right

256
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,899
this is prima's Twitter uh what prima's

257
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,180
Twitter found uh was that not only could

258
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,040
they get the same kind of results by

259
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,620
intervening with these um uh civility

260
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,920
prompts but that they persisted over a

261
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,320
period of extra days that not only the

262
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,420
person make a better choice at the time

263
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,060
but they made better choices in the next

264
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,519
several days they're after and so that

265
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,339
that um that little good Angel sitting

266
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,100
on your your virtual shoulder online was

267
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,140
actually encouraging people to do better

268
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,140
than they would have chosen to do

269
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,940
um just by virtue of the intervention

270
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,760
now some of you are saying this doesn't

271
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,760
actually sound new and so some of you

272
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,700
may remember for example that um uh uh

273
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,500
Eudora right this is a crowd that might

274
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,440
remember Eudora um uh Eudora actually

275
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,320
did this over 20 years ago they were

276
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,120
trying to do the exact same thing with

277
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,820
civility props and that's part of my

278
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,100
project is to say we've been trying

279
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,580
these things for years what can we learn

280
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,920
from them let's put them together in a

281
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,720
single place to say these are ways in

282
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,339
which the technology can make us do

283
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,540
better

284
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,760
so my goal is to collect up examples

285
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,620
like these civility prompts put them

286
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,480
into a book that says here's a series of

287
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
case studies of empirical data that's

288
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,620
been developed over the course of the

289
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,860
past 25 plus years that show us how we

290
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,040
can move towards a better uh forms of

291
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,300
interaction I don't know if you remember

292
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,220
with Eudora they actually did it with

293
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,860
the three Chili Pepper approach uh the

294
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,480
first Chili Peppers like you know hey

295
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,180
careful second Chili Peppers like

296
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,740
um uh you know hey this is getting a

297
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,180
little spicy here and third Chili

298
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,440
Peppers like you know do you really

299
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,540
really really want to do that of course

300
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,700
you know that when it was a chili pepper

301
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,680
type thing some people like how can I

302
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,720
get the fourth Chili Pepper how can I go

303
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,279
over the limit

304
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,140
um so you have to watch out how it's uh

305
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,579
designed

306
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,800
again skip over the slide in the

307
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,240
interest of times

308
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,760
um so I'm giving you just one an

309
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,399
anecdote just one little example of how

310
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,980
the intervention could help improve The

311
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,720
Human Condition but let me talk about

312
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,700
some of the policy implications of this

313
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,920
what from a regulatory standpoint what

314
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,019
does this tell us or teach us

315
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,779
um so the first thing is that it's

316
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,019
unrealistic to expect services to fix

317
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,540
long-standing human problems and that's

318
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,040
basically where The Regulators are going

319
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,320
today they're saying I don't care that

320
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,180
people are anti-social offline I

321
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,880
expected to eliminate anti-social

322
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,220
Behavior online and that's just not

323
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,920
realistic not only can we not squeeze

324
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,839
out the anti-social tendencies in the

325
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,000
human species but we certainly can't do

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,040
it immediately and certainly internet

327
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,839
companies don't have the ability to do

328
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,620
that

329
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,620
um so the whole construct of expecting

330
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,019
Zero Tolerance type approaches to the

331
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,360
internet doesn't work and if you look at

332
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,800
what's going on in places like Europe

333
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,600
there's proposed they're called things

334
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
like ant Online safety bills they're

335
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
basically saying you don't have to

336
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,899
eliminate anti-social Behavior but if

337
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,820
you don't we're going to penalize you so

338
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,399
basically saying don't allow anti-social

339
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,899
Behavior online that's simply not

340
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,320
possible

341
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,300
um and when we demand more from the

342
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,800
internet services than they're capable

343
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,320
of delivering it actually becomes a

344
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,480
wedge in the relationship um Aaron

345
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,220
servers like if you asked me to do that

346
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,380
and I simply cannot I have to do

347
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,740
something different either I drug you

348
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,240
know control my environment in such a

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,740
way that prevents people from talking to

350
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,959
each other more likely I say this is a

351
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,240
game I can't win just like with Whopper

352
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,040
the only way to win is not to play

353
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,519
whatsoever so we're actually seeing this

354
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,000
concern about the asking services to do

355
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
better than the offline Baseline

356
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,220
um uh you know to eliminate the

357
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,480
antisocial Behavior that's in the

358
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,680
offline World

359
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,420
um is basically a way of saying don't do

360
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,920
what you're doing at all don't allow

361
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,260
these conversations to take place

362
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,180
now what's going to happen in response

363
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,279
to this is actually quite horrifying but

364
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,959
we're already seeing it we're going to

365
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,600
see a broad scale shift in the internet

366
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,899
away from user generated content us

367
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,000
talking to each other to the

368
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,980
broadcasting model where a small number

369
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,040
of professionally professionally

370
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,839
professional producers are broadcasting

371
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,600
content at us it's basically the model

372
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
of the internet that we feared we were

373
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
going to see back in the mid 1990s that

374
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,079
we were going to replicate the model of

375
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,639
the cable companies the Thousand

376
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,980
channels that we all had to pay for in

377
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,779
our bundled fee when we paid our cable

378
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,220
companies we'd have a choice whether or

379
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,540
not to pay for them we were giving money

380
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,279
to these services and then they were

381
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,540
dooling out all these professional

382
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,240
producers who buys with a thousand

383
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,740
channels yet a lot of choices you just

384
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,000
didn't have the choices that you have

385
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,459
today and who loses in that model

386
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,980
there's two main losers the people who

387
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,959
don't get access to broadcast their

388
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,639
content and who are the people are going

389
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,560
to get access and who aren't that's

390
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,180
going to reify the existing power

391
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,560
structure who's going to get out access

392
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,600
to people have power the people who

393
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,399
don't have power they don't get access

394
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,260
to broadcast what else is going to

395
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,500
happen is as we launch these paywalls to

396
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,980
shut off content

397
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,440
from people we basically create a model

398
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,720
of haves and have-nots we deepen the

399
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,339
digital divide even further to say

400
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,320
either you can afford to pay to get

401
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,660
access to content or you can we haven't

402
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,060
worried so much about that in the in the

403
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,740
user General because we've been seeing

404
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,839
the production of so much freely

405
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,300
accessible content and that model is

406
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,339
under extraordinary pressure because of

407
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,779
the regulatory mechanisms that are

408
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,600
driving people away from user generated

409
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,100
content

410
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,260
one of the other comments I get is that

411
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,699
people say well look this is just the

412
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,139
Boomers they don't know what they're

413
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,279
doing

414
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,139
um and so you know they're coming in

415
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:48,779
they're just uh imposing these

416
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,120
ridiculous obligations in ways uh that

417
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,760
are not um uh uh uh that can't be

418
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,380
complied with and honestly I don't

419
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,579
believe the boomers are the biggest

420
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,019
problem I think the biggest problem are

421
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,420
the Millennials and especially gen Z gen

422
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,139
Z grew up with all of the anti-social

423
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:06,899
experiences all being needed online they

424
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,339
don't even think about the fact that

425
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,899
people are offered online because they

426
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,940
didn't spend nearly as much time offline

427
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,019
as all uh the older Generations did so

428
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,779
essentially they equate bad behavior

429
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,339
with bad behavior on the internet

430
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,199
they're the same thing for the digital

431
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:24,720
Natives and that posed extreme problems

432
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,180
for the future if the future is we think

433
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,560
that the technologically literary gonna

434
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,500
say this they don't know what their what

435
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,540
uh how where the situations that we have

436
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,339
they don't know what um the alternative

437
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,440
looks like they don't remember models of

438
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,480
information scarce City and they're more

439
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,100
willing to say I'm going to penalize the

440
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,380
internet because of the fact uh that I

441
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,880
suffered all these experiences growing

442
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,339
up so I think the model isn't going to

443
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,600
get better it's actually going to get

444
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,680
worse

445
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,300
um over time

446
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,920
okay so what are we going to do about

447
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,720
this just some ideas of things we might

448
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,760
do differently this is the most obvious

449
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,040
one evidence-based policy making we

450
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,899
shouldn't be making policies based on

451
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,480
these presumptions I I wish that you'd

452
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,339
weigh the magic wand and get rid of all

453
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,380
antisocial content and that's just not

454
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,579
possible

455
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,320
um so what we should be doing is General

456
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,839
kinds of things like you establish an

457
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,699
offline barrier sign for comparison and

458
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,260
you say okay let's see if we can work

459
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,339
with

460
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,620
um uh the the services to achieve that

461
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,959
offline Baseline to not Turbo Charge it

462
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,240
but to at least do no worse than

463
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,680
mirroring it but we have to be honest

464
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,240
about the fact that there is this

465
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,980
offline Baseline Regulators aren't doing

466
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,380
that we should be using standard

467
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,180
methodologies like cost benefit analysis

468
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,339
once the intervention cost us what does

469
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,740
intervention benefit for us that's not

470
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,540
happening at all and in fact one of the

471
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,399
main reasons not happening is because

472
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,800
we've lost the discussion or the

473
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,839
narrative about the pro-social benefits

474
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,820
of the internet so because we're not

475
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,320
getting that

476
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,259
um we're not hearing the call cost of

477
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,420
enter of changing the internet the

478
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,279
regular is like all I hear is complaints

479
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,959
I'm not hearing one tell me why they

480
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,180
actually care about this so there's it's

481
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,699
like an easy call fix the complaints you

482
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:03,480
don't have to worry about the

483
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,760
opportunity cost one of the main goals

484
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,319
of my book is to tell all these

485
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,819
opportunity costs to put them in an

486
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,980
elegant fashion it says here's the ways

487
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,359
that we could be better and the

488
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,679
regulation that you're proposing

489
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,059
actually is going to prevent us from

490
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,780
being able to do that

491
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,359
um we should expand the adoption of

492
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,740
pro-social techniques we should

493
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,619
understand what works and then we should

494
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,199
try to propagate it now there's not a

495
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,240
one-size-fits-all solution here what

496
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,320
works in uh uh internet service a isn't

497
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,640
guaranteed to work in Internet service

498
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,799
speed so we can't mandate that they're

499
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,260
all across but we can say let's learn

500
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,820
from what we've experienced here is

501
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,780
there's things that would be

502
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,760
replicatable elsewhere and the

503
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,200
government can do this by doing things

504
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,120
like funding research the government has

505
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,640
a role to play in using its power of the

506
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,440
purse to produce more of the information

507
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,880
that will help people understand that

508
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,520
they can also do things to help diffuse

509
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,559
that knowledge to share it so that

510
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,480
people are learning from each other the

511
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,860
government is not thinking in those

512
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,419
terms they're thinking in terms of how

513
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,580
do we crack down and force people to do

514
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,799
less as opposed to how do we actually

515
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,260
propagate the best ideas how can we use

516
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,280
our power to do that

517
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,480
and this may sound obvious

518
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,580
um but one of my calls of action to you

519
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,280
is you should be telling whoever you

520
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,440
your elected politicians are to be

521
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,200
fighting for the internet not fighting

522
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,240
against the internet and I guarantee you

523
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,799
every single person in this room you

524
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,299
have voted for people who are working

525
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:31,620
against the internet how am I so

526
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,179
confident because everyone is it's

527
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,980
there's no politicians fighting for the

528
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,320
internet anymore so all of them with

529
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,419
your tax dollars with the support of

530
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,940
your vote are actually working against

531
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,760
the future of the internet they don't

532
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,799
care because they're not hearing enough

533
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,559
pushback from people like you and that

534
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,660
may sound weird like well I'm just one

535
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,120
person I don't have anything to say

536
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,360
absolutely you do they work for you I

537
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,280
know that sounds weird but that's how

538
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,320
they think and if you tell them what

539
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,820
that they're not doing the job you want

540
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,059
they will listen

541
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:08,160
um and so uh my final

542
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,080
um recommendation is we do need to

543
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,720
actually impose some some some

544
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,280
detriments to people who are working

545
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,320
against the internet and we can't just

546
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,120
keep rubber stamping the same folks and

547
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,260
expecting that we're going to change

548
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,419
their behavior so long as there's

549
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,880
political payoffs to politicians to be

550
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,740
working against the internet with

551
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,900
they're going to keep doing it and so we

552
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,640
need to not only tell them what we want

553
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,140
but we need to actually hold them

554
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,480
accountable when they don't this is not

555
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,580
happening today and some of the reasons

556
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,440
why is because of talks like the ones

557
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,520
that you're hitting at the rest of this

558
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,020
conference here are all the problems

559
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,940
internet as long as that's all we're

560
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,620
talking about we're going to miss the

561
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,660
fact that this political calculus feeds

562
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,200
into care a change in something that I

563
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,360
think is worth fighting for

564
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,220
um I actually think I came in under my

565
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,440
20 minutes not sure but it was my goal

566
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,820
because I know you're going to have some

567
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,260
comments and questions and why don't we

568
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,240
see what's on your mind

569
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,060
whatever

570
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,700
[Applause]
