1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,300
so two years ago I have been here at

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,699
Enigma to talk about my experience as a

4
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,500
Maori analyst investigating Brazilian

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,779
mower samples by that time Brazilian

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,820
more symbols were not well described in

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,980
the literature which motivated me to

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,779
claim the need for an increased number

9
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,840
of region specific observational studies

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,059
but this is not the only challenge that

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,920
one entering the secured field would

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,440
face while entering our field

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,660
today I present five view other aspects

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,100
to change to make our research field

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,680
stronger so come with me

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,200
every search is potentially limited or

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,539
flawed my impression however is that

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,280
this complaint is much more frequent and

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,320
bigger in the secured field maybe

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,539
because the impacts of secured flaws are

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,120
huge anyway everybody has its own

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,219
concerns about the current state of our

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,300
field

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,400
if we're here to the industry and the

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,500
practitioners we will hear complaints

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,720
about how slow paced the research

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,540
developments are about how hard is to

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,100
transition to practice the research

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,560
outcomes that you have and also how we

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,900
are failing to educate our students

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,240
if we listen to the Academia it also has

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,220
its own complaints it's also aware of

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,979
its own limitations the pioneers of the

34
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,659
science of security movement already

35
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,659
pointed out that the field has severe

36
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,820
limitations reporting experimental

37
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,740
results and making experiments

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,619
reproducible my question here is what's

39
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,840
the actual size of this problem

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,180
and more importantly how do we move

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,920
forward how they solve these problems

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,780
and try to find Solutions

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,340
my point here is that you should

44
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,799
acknowledge some problems so we can go

45
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,380
towards a solution so let's adapt them

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,060
to The Logical position here that our

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,460
research security research is broken

48
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,860
I mean I do not fully agree with that I

49
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,659
believe that research contributions from

50
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,460
the past has led us to a better world

51
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,920
nowadays than in the past so these

52
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,119
research contributions were very

53
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,340
important but let act as a scientist

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,800
here so let's put this hypothesis and

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,540
let's see what are its implications so

56
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,920
maybe you can find some ways to move

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,720
forward

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,360
my cleanser you rely upon a paper that I

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,980
published that is the challenge that

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,440
pitfalls in our research it's a paper in

61
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,020
which I review more than 400 papers

62
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,760
published in the last days in the last

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,860
20 years in the top security venues

64
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,480
pointing out toward the challenge and

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,280
pitfalls that we and other researchers

66
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,800
face while developing security research

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
and here I talk more about malware

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,459
because this is my background this is

69
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,260
the research field I work on so I feel

70
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,760
more comfortable to make some cleanse

71
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,620
about it but in fact most of the

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,480
outcomes that I represent apply to any

73
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,400
secure domain

74
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,200
and that's important to highlight here

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,940
that what I'm proposing here it's a

76
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,400
reflection exercise not a pointy finger

77
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,500
exercise even because my own research

78
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,120
has many of these flaws that I represent

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,580
so what I'm trying to do here is to

80
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,959
pointing out to what are the most common

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,819
Challenge and pitfalls that we have to

82
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,120
face there could be 20 as the paper but

83
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,620
I chose to talk about the five most

84
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,660
concerning ones in My Views starting

85
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,280
right now

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
so the first one is that uh first

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,480
practice to change is to stop focusing

88
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,239
on the same research types because there

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,180
are multiple research types right they

90
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,040
have engineering Solutions there are

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,659
typically the defenses that we propose

92
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,540
but also have offensive work and they

93
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,540
also have observational studies so how

94
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,340
are these types of work distributed

95
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,440
among our fields

96
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,840
according to our literature review we

97
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,060
have a prevalence of our years of these

98
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,879
engineering Solutions more than that we

99
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,799
have more engineering Solutions than any

100
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,420
other type of research combined

101
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,459
typically offensive work and

102
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,379
observational studies are in a limited

103
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,440
number in the literature so is this a

104
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,599
good thing

105
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,700
um to claim something as good or bad you

106
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,560
need to have a model of what we consider

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,080
the ideal which in our case is the merge

108
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,239
of the scientific method and Engineering

109
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,340
method because you know security field

110
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,319
is integrated and very complex

111
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,319
so we expect people first to observe the

112
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,540
phenomenon in practice to identify that

113
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,159
it's something undesired secured

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,019
violation on their problems

115
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,238
and then to propose hypothesis to handle

116
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,100
that it's basically the explanation of

117
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,839
the scientific method right

118
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,060
but you put this hypothesis to test we

119
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,919
need to develop sometimes very ingenious

120
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,259
very complex Solutions proof of Concepts

121
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,940
there are the engineering Solutions so

122
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,340
you have to merge these two methods and

123
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,840
according this to Method it was

124
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
plausible to report a size that would

125
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,060
have a lot of observational studies

126
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,800
because these are the works that are

127
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,900
proposing the hypothesis right so these

128
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,880
are informed informing the development

129
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,919
of future engineering Solutions

130
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,780
but this is not what happens in practice

131
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,699
right so you have much more engineering

132
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,880
Solutions why it happens

133
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,740
um at first hypothesis could be that

134
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,780
engineering Solutions or defensive

135
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,699
Solutions are intrinsically harder to be

136
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,220
implemented so researchers need more

137
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,900
attempts so they end up publishing more

138
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,720
papers but this hypothesis is a bit weak

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,419
another hypothesis maybe researchers are

140
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,280
not following this expected way of

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,500
conducting research so they are

142
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,199
developed more independent way of taking

143
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,240
project decisions they are not based on

144
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,680
their decision on previous observational

145
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,560
studies and they adapt with solutions

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,419
that do not perfectly match the

147
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,340
operational scenario so they have to

148
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,080
refine and to refactor the solutions

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,880
which also end up in more papers being

150
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,020
published

151
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,300
and what I discover is that that this is

152
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,220
exactly the scenario the majority of the

153
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,440
papers published in the literature uh

154
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,780
are basically ad dock decisions from the

155
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,820
reviewers in the sense that previous

156
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,039
observational studies are not used to

157
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,800
inform project decisions to define the

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,080
engineering Solutions parameters or to

159
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,539
define the populations of the

160
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,360
experimental settings and why it happens

161
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,120
well one of the hypothesis is that there

162
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,919
is a scarce number of observational

163
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,840
studies to support this engineering

164
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,180
solution but this creates a cycle right

165
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,580
so to move this field forward a first

166
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,800
thing is to break the cycle and to have

167
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,080
more observationals from the field more

168
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,060
observational papers and most

169
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,919
importantly make the information in

170
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,840
these papers useful to inform the

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,699
project decisions of the engineering

172
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,680
solutions that will develop

173
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,960
but this is just a first challenge there

174
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,639
are more challenges to come

175
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,800
a second challenge is to look more to

176
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,240
the market into the industry When

177
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,919
developing these Solutions

178
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,680
because you know sometimes we especially

179
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,660
in Academia Technologies sometimes lives

180
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,639
in a two Ideal World but the problems

181
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,199
happens next in the practice natural

182
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,240
world so you need to look more to that

183
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,039
when it's needed the challenge here is

184
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,300
of course you didn't fight when it's

185
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,819
needed I represent you two scenarios to

186
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,460
try to help this identification the

187
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,979
first one are the target platforms right

188
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,800
now most of you like 99 are carrying a

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,319
mood core system on your pockets but

190
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,940
less than one percent of The Works

191
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,500
published in the literature are covering

192
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,300
mood core system right now

193
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,039
so this creates an understanding Gap

194
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,259
about this type of solution and I know

195
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,940
that's completely acceptable to develop

196
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,680
single core solution as proof of

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
Concepts that will be transitioned to

198
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,340
practice as smooth core implementations

199
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,080
in the future but I'm talking here about

200
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,120
understanding gap of specific phenomena

201
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,819
what about moot core malware what about

202
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,580
distributed threats how much examples of

203
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,620
that investigations of these phenomenons

204
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,020
can you find in the literature well here

205
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,599
I can point you to two right

206
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,680
another example

207
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,199
of a mismatch between industry research

208
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,960
and academics research is the use of

209
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,020
signatures by antiviruses because the

210
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,759
antivirus industry largely relies on

211
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,979
signatures not only on signatures it's

212
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,900
important to highlight but largely rely

213
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,580
on signatures because they are very

214
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,020
effective for many tests they are

215
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,819
compacted to be stored faster to match

216
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,560
it fast to be developed although they

217
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,780
have some drawbacks but academics seems

218
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,180
to prefer to work more with other

219
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,860
approach typically machine learning

220
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,539
approach that are more flexible are

221
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,639
capable of detecting zero days but they

222
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,340
also have drawbacks like the performance

223
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,199
and we can see in the literature tour

224
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,880
this practical divide we can see that in

225
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,800
the recent years basically all papers

226
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,360
are proposing machine learn based

227
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,120
detections and not signature detections

228
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,580
so my point here is how we academics

229
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,440
want to cause impact in the real world

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,479
if we are not studying the solutions

231
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,360
that are actually used in the real world

232
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,039
and by that point you might be thinking

233
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,319
okay so the point is uh we should look

234
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,879
to the markets in the industry this is

235
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,919
the solution for everything right but

236
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,419
it's not the case because the problem is

237
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,000
complex so in some cases we should stop

238
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,380
and look into the industry into the

239
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,820
market because in some case the industry

240
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,260
cannot provide a better answer than

241
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,360
Academia sometimes relying too much in

242
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,979
the market might even cause a harm into

243
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,980
our experiments for example consider

244
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,839
that we are Implement an experiment

245
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,640
perform an experiment typical one to

246
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,620
detect if something is malware or not or

247
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,480
if something is unpacked or not we are

248
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,740
training a machine learning plus fire

249
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,420
that's the typical approach that is used

250
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,459
and we need to collect the positive case

251
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,860
like goodware data where does this

252
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,980
goodware data came from well in most

253
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,480
experiments according to our literature

254
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,399
to review this data came from The

255
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,620
Crawling of Internet repositories and

256
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,779
also from marketplaces what's the

257
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,820
rationale about that researchers are

258
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,500
basically trying to reproduce the real

259
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,060
world they are ranking these repost

260
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,560
towards and trying to collect the most

261
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,480
popular applications with the

262
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,980
expectation that this reflects the

263
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,779
applications that are actually used by

264
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,459
the majority of users

265
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,080
this is a good intention

266
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
but as they got the intention you know

267
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,399
the paved to the to the road to the

268
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,839
house paved with good intentions right

269
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,300
so there are also drawbacks here uh a

270
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,740
problem is there's no guarantee that

271
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,720
these repositors are free from malware

272
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,160
there is no guarantee that the

273
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,019
applications are not crucialized there

274
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,580
is no guarantee this applications are

275
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,260
not bundled with the spyware and

276
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,480
unwanted software in general so you

277
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,220
might be end up biasing your classifier

278
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,519
and to learn these lots of unintended

279
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,380
Behavior as benign

280
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,180
and one might say okay but the solution

281
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,459
for that is to rely on antivirus to

282
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,320
pre-scan all files to ensure that they

283
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,580
are clear right

284
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,860
well it happens that once again rely on

285
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,500
antivirus is complex researchers rely on

286
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
antivirus Forge a lot of desks more

287
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,180
specifically researchers Reliant

288
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,040
antivirus labels to train machine

289
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,540
learning models and also to perform

290
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,640
comparisons we are always comparison

291
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,620
comparing if our results of our

292
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,480
development tools are better or worse

293
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,820
than an antivirus but as you can see in

294
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,620
the figure antivirus labels are not

295
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,380
homogeneous antivirus labels in fact are

296
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,300
very different depending on solution to

297
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,980
solution so far the same sample as you

298
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,600
can see here different labels are

299
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,880
generated even though we try to use some

300
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,860
approach to make them homogeneous it's

301
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,720
problematic because the meaning of the

302
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,120
label is different for each solution

303
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,820
worse than that the antivirus labels

304
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,920
often do not provide very useful

305
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,660
information research-wise for instance

306
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,660
antivirus do not disclose what are they

307
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,660
um engines that generated that label so

308
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,880
it's hard to perform fair comparison how

309
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,200
can you compare Your solution against

310
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,600
antivirus label in the case that if you

311
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,160
are proposing a signature based

312
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,779
detection you are comparing Your

313
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,339
solution with label generated by

314
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,019
antivirus using machine learning engine

315
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,420
or on the opposite if you are proposing

316
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,860
a machine learning detection solution

317
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,420
you are comparing a result against

318
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,579
labels generated by antivirus that use

319
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,560
signature matching so you might be

320
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
understating or overstating the results

321
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,540
of your experiment because of that so

322
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,980
the solution here is clearly not to

323
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,380
blindly rely on antivirus not blind rely

324
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,660
on any software any industry solution

325
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,360
but to have stronger methodology to have

326
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,399
standards to have guidelines to perform

327
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,860
these experiments and academics are

328
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,360
supposed to be good at developing

329
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,279
guidelines and standards and I say

330
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,079
suppose because the scenario is not so

331
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,100
simple

332
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,600
once again let's talk about an

333
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,980
experiment we are trying to classify

334
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,260
something as malicious or not and we

335
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,000
have to define a data set size for this

336
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
experiment what's the ideal data set

337
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,160
size well in fact we do not know right

338
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,839
so you can see here there is no pattern

339
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,519
in the works published in the literature

340
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,579
to have a data set size of all size in

341
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,079
the literature authors trying to prove

342
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,180
multiple claims using different data set

343
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,079
size

344
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,940
even worse sometimes there are

345
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,740
contradictory results there are words

346
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,720
saying that one million hour samples is

347
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,820
enough to present a landscape of them

348
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,800
our scenarios Wireless others say that

349
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,779
one million samples is the bare minimum

350
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,399
number of samples should train a machine

351
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,899
learning classifier

352
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,579
once again as I presented before

353
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,440
researchers seem to be taking sometimes

354
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,200
adult decisions the only pattern that we

355
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,420
can see here is that the average the

356
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,220
median average of the data set is

357
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,899
growing and this is because an effect

358
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,360
that we call Anchor bias that is in the

359
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,459
absence of a guideline what it what

360
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,440
happens is that a previous study in that

361
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,720
particular field becomes a reference for

362
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,820
future developments it establishes an

363
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,860
anchor for future developments so we

364
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,620
start to want data sets bigger and

365
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,899
bigger because of that but you know

366
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,579
bigger is not necessary the better

367
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,440
because in the end you do not want a

368
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,940
bigger data set size we want a

369
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,220
representative data set size but as I

370
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,660
told you two years ago for the case of

371
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,040
Brazilian hour samples they were not

372
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
represented in the literature and many

373
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,820
of these words do not represent many

374
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,519
populations that are still vulnerable

375
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,620
this lack of guidelines also creates

376
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,120
another problem that is the

377
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,760
reproducibility crisis and I know by

378
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,740
that time every scientific field has a

379
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,660
reproducibility crisis to call yours I

380
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,639
know but I would like to talk about the

381
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,200
security one because it's a little bit

382
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,040
different

383
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,600
there are human factors and

384
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,100
technological factors so the human

385
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,500
factors are related to our practice so

386
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,300
they are subject to change

387
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,680
once again you are developing

388
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,480
experiments we want to collect now

389
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,880
malware samples or attack samples and

390
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,380
where do they come from

391
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,940
according to our literature to review

392
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,860
they came from The Crawling of internet

393
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,680
repositors now malicious one and also

394
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,380
from companies partner companies that

395
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,779
share their repositors but since most of

396
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,040
these companies are not research

397
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,980
entities they don't want to disclose how

398
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,600
they were breached about which secrets

399
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,760
were breached so the data sets are often

400
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,500
not available and even though if they

401
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,420
are secured companies that actually

402
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,940
worry about doing research they do not

403
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,079
want to disclose their commercial

404
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,940
secrets so how they collected these

405
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,279
samples so what happens in that is that

406
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,500
in most case researchers are under NADA

407
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,660
non-disclosure agreements so for the

408
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,339
majority of the works in the literature

409
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:12,480
you're recording our literature to

410
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,160
review the data sets are not available

411
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,139
so it's impossible to immediately

412
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,260
reproduce the experiments as they are

413
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,180
but even though if we have access to all

414
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,860
the samples you still have problems

415
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,600
because there are also the technological

416
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,459
problems related to the nature of the

417
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,220
problem that is if we have access to all

418
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,019
the samples there is no guarantee that

419
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:32,519
you're running Mr experiment in the

420
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,079
future you lead to the same result as in

421
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,639
the present because there is no

422
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,079
guarantee that the mower sample will not

423
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,820
download a different payload that

424
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,920
servers will be reachable or that

425
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,540
command and controls will not have been

426
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,899
sink hold so there is still not a widely

427
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,000
established way to perform this kind of

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,279
experiment so there's not a very widely

429
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,440
established and accepted manner to

430
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,420
reproduce malware and many other types

431
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,699
of experiments that require this kind of

432
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:00,660
reproduce reproducibility aspect

433
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,000
so considering that this is very

434
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,920
important and we matter about that these

435
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,940
are really problems that you should

436
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,639
solve uh how to move forward

437
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,260
it's very complicated but I have a few

438
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,800
ideas first of all for us as researchers

439
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,019
we should try to diversify more the

440
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,120
types of work that we present so

441
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,160
basically we should perform more

442
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,899
longitudinal studies more observational

443
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,180
studies to provide useful data we need

444
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,220
data from The Real World from actual

445
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,380
infections from the prevalence of the

446
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,480
affected populations so we can better

447
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,100
inform the development of the

448
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,420
engineering Solutions

449
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,399
and when we are wearing the Hat of

450
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,440
reviewers program program committees or

451
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,300
any other position of power we should

452
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,579
worry about more about developing these

453
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,500
guidelines this best practice this is

454
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,480
standards we as a community should have

455
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,760
a clear message what is considered

456
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,560
secured for us what are the best

457
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,720
practices in our view what do you want

458
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,880
to achieve with our experiments so

459
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,220
what's our goal in detecting some type

460
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,079
of attack this should be clear for us as

461
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,000
a community and it's not clear at the

462
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,079
moment

463
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,180
and also for the field as a whole I

464
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,920
think we should start stop worrying a

465
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,139
lot about data set size and start

466
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,699
worrying more about reproducibility

467
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,399
because in the end we do not study files

468
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,260
we study phenomena we're studying

469
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,839
effective we study people right so if

470
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,180
you want to solve the data set size

471
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,339
problem let's establish as a guideline

472
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,260
that the good data set is the

473
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,420
representative data set if you want to

474
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,399
solve the reproducibility problem let's

475
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,440
state that the solution is to study

476
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,720
population do not matter the files if we

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
study in the same population we are

478
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,500
observing the same phenomena so they

479
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,839
will be reproducible right and of course

480
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,440
for our venues let's be clear for the

481
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,360
authors for the presenters that these

482
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,980
types of different populations instead

483
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,139
is observational studies are welcome in

484
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,839
very nice place like here at Enigma this

485
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,639
is just the tip of an iceberg this

486
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,320
beginning of a discussion there's a lot

487
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,300
to be talked about but what I'd like to

488
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,800
do here is to foster a discussion so

489
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,540
I'll be open here to discuss with you

490
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,700
thanks a lot

491
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,759
[Applause]
