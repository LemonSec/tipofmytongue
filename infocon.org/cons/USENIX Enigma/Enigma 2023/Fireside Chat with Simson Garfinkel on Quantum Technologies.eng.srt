00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,859
welcome back from lunch thank you so

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,920
much for getting back promptly for this

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,900
uh and thank you for joining us for a

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,060
romp through the world of quantum is

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,220
what I'm calling it I'm Joseph Lorenzo

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,500
Hall I'm from the internet Society for

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,720
our site impaired audience I'm about six

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,480
foot three 230 pound white man no hair

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,160
with a beard sitting next to me as

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,960
Simpson garfinkel who I'll introduce in

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,739
a sec who has a lot of hair and no beard

13
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,180
um anyway

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,000
um Simpson is a fellow of the aaas the

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,700
ACM and I Triple E and he holds a PhD in

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,800
computer science from MIT and a master

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,840
of science in journalism from Columbia

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
University which you heard mentioned

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,760
earlier today I remember since it is a

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,140
computer scientist I've met in grad

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,500
school who like me was slightly obsessed

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,719
with research ethics and things like

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,519
institutional review boards which is not

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,080
what computer scientists tend to talk

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,520
about until you get in trouble with one

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,020
of them

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,640
um but we're here to talk about Quantum

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,860
Technologies in a recent book from

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,600
Simpson and his co-author who some of

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,700
you might know Chris hoofnagel it's

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,619
called the law and policy for the

32
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,080
quantum age this is available via Open

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,640
Access you can go download it right now

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,259
I encourage you it's a really good book

35
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,840
from Cambridge University press with a

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,180
recent audible version It's Abridged so

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,700
it's not the whole entire thing and

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,979
spoken by a fantastic voice over artist

39
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,159
or a voice artist but first we want to

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
sort of get a feel of the room how much

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,320
do you all know about Quantum

42
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,759
Technologies can I get a show of hands

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,920
if you know the difference between

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,360
Quantum cryptography and quantum

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,799
cryptanalysis

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,780
can I get a show of hands if you know

47
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,520
the difference between Quantum sensing

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,140
Quantum Computing and Quantum

49
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,579
Communications

50
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,220
okay it looks like what is entanglement

51
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,799
raise your hand if you feel comfortable

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,140
with entanglement spooky action at a

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,479
distance

54
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,619
clearly we'll have to do a little bit of

55
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,959
level setting what should these folks

56
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,760
know before we launch into what we'll do

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,319
is do a little bit of discussion of what

58
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,400
you should know and then we'll talk

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
about myths and facts and we're going to

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,520
tend to talk to each other since the

61
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,900
lights are so bright but they're really

62
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,840
bright so so this is a fire so the fire

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
is a good example of a Quantum process

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,379
right like the whole reason that we can

65
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,840
see it is that these electrons are being

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,640
stimulated and then they're relaxing

67
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,200
they're getting stimulating from the

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,580
Heat and when they relax they let off

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,040
light at different frequencies and

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,900
that's a Quantum phenomena but that's

71
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,780
not the kind of quantum phenomena that

72
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,560
is used for Quantum Computing

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,140
that is quantum physics

74
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,840
but Quantum Computing is based on this

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,379
idea of entanglement which is making the

76
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,540
system not make a decision about whether

77
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,879
the cat's going to be alive or dead to

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,160
use the Schrodinger analogy like when

79
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,400
you when you measure a Quantum process

80
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,440
that determines something about the

81
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,060
quantum process and the way the quantum

82
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,760
computers work is they prepare a whole

83
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,540
bunch of qubits which are these bits

84
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,780
that are in superposition and then a

85
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,580
whole bunch of gates are sent to the

86
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,019
qubits

87
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,900
while they're all in superposition

88
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,060
and then we measure the qubits and we

89
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,239
see what are the most likely results and

90
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,099
that operation is typically repeated

91
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,260
thousands and thousands of times to get

92
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,620
a distribution of possible answers and

93
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,379
and that's how a quantum computer

94
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:40,319
briefly works so gates are sent to the

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,760
qubit that sounds a little different

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,799
than normal it's completely different

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:45,840
like so with our normal computers that

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,000
you know for those of you who are into

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
architecture the um the code uh is in

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,060
memory and data is in memory and we

101
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,580
bring memory into the CPU which is this

102
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,459
fast the arithmetic logical unit and

103
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,040
then we we change some gates and we do

104
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,659
some math we send it back out to memory

105
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,200
but with Quantum the the bits stay in

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,560
the the core and the program gets played

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,159
through the get the bits or the qubits

108
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,659
now you've heard a lot about qubits like

109
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,060
they can store all so much data that

110
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,738
that doesn't really matter

111
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,540
um because when you measure them they're

112
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,759
either one or zero

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,780
uh we we hear things that uh there are

114
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,139
these two big algorithms that was the

115
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,820
real reason that the world became

116
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
interested in Quantum Computing so the

117
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,740
idea of quantum Computing dates back

118
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,979
really to 1981 Richard Feynman gave a

119
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,979
talk at a conference talking about oh we

120
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,440
could have a computer based on Quantum

121
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,500
compute mice on Quantum properties and

122
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,139
use that to simulate Quantum

123
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,300
interactions

124
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,940
but um

125
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,160
uh a guy named Peter Shore came up with

126
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,380
an algorithm that would run on this

127
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,180
hypothetical computer that could be used

128
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,820
for factoring and it could factor in

129
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,280
polynomial time rather than in

130
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,020
exponential time which is what we're

131
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,820
dealing with now

132
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,419
um

133
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,000
and that would make it much easier to

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,240
crack RSA encryption it also crafts

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,540
elliptical curve encryption

136
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,539
and um and there was a another algorithm

137
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,240
that was used for search space it

138
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
basically gives you a square root speed

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,060
up of the ability of searching not

140
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,460
through a database but searching for a

141
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,280
correct answer like the particular AES

142
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,100
key that decrypts this message and

143
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,620
that's Grover's algorithm and so it

144
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,000
effectively turns AES 128 into aes64 and

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,620
it effectively turns AES 256 into aes128

146
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,720
so if you want to protect your data

147
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
against these machines that might exist

148
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,580
in the future

149
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,259
the first thing is you should be using

150
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,800
AES 256 because there's really no

151
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,880
penalty now for using AES 256 over

152
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,560
aes128 and even with Grover's algorithm

153
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,479
aes128 it can't be cracked for the

154
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,720
conceivable lifetime of humanity

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,860
um

156
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,500
with uh with RSA

157
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,960
that the feeling is that you should move

158
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,680
to algorithms that can't be cracked by

159
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,020
Shores algorithm so the National

160
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,900
Security Agency has been looking at

161
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,060
other public key encryption algorithms

162
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,479
that would be resistant to Shore's

163
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,699
algorithm that are not susceptible to

164
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,039
this attack and they've come up with

165
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,720
several and there's a standardization

166
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,840
process happening and that's all based

167
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,860
on the idea of being able to do

168
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,039
computation with superposition

169
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,860
using qubits right these are qubits but

170
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,039
you might say well we want three bits so

171
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,220
they're called Q trips or with D levels

172
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,620
it's cudit so these these machines that

173
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,660
have just a few qubits might be scaled

174
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,600
up relatively quickly to to have more

175
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,539
States that's that's research

176
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,100
and that's one of the fears right

177
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,099
today's machines have hundreds of noisy

178
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,340
qubits but in the future we might

179
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,319
suddenly have machines with thousands or

180
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,199
tens of thousands of of noisy qubits

181
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,660
noise means that when you do that that

182
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,900
computation you don't always even get

183
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,599
the correct Quantum answer the the noise

184
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,199
kills the superposition and and the the

185
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,500
calculation just doesn't happen

186
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,780
um and that's a problem

187
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,599
um or you get something very very wrong

188
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,099
and so there's this idea of using

189
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,960
Quantum error correction

190
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,940
that the details always matter and

191
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,680
they're always different for the

192
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,419
different machines

193
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,819
the the sense right now is that to

194
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,099
simulate the thousands of qubits that

195
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,280
you would need to crack an RSA key you'd

196
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,919
need between 10 and 20 million noisy

197
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,900
qubits wow it seems like a lot I was

198
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,840
just reading an IEEE Spectrum

199
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,740
short article about IBM's plan for the

200
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,680
year which sounds like it includes

201
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,639
building more noisy qubits building a

202
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,280
smaller amount of less noisy qubits and

203
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,160
then connecting groups of qubits

204
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,760
together to create a bigger right and

205
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,919
and so so a few years ago Google

206
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,880
published this article that to to crack

207
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,659
a RSA key like the keys we're using

208
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,679
today

209
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,560
eight hours on a machine with 20 million

210
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,959
qubits that you can keep in super

211
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,080
position for eight hours so you have to

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,779
have so little noise that it it's not

213
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,300
going to quench in eight hours

214
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,920
um but maybe the way you build that

215
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,500
machine is you have a thousand qubits

216
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
and you connect

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,580
um 20 000 of those machines together

218
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,920
with a quantum network

219
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,720
so what Quantum networking allows you to

220
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,339
do is it allows you to

221
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,519
collect connect two computers together

222
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,920
quantum computers and have them share

223
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,620
that superposition you can think of

224
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,440
quantum networking as flying qubits I

225
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,660
didn't make that up that somebody much

226
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,399
smarter than me made that up

227
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,080
and a quantum network that only

228
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,860
transmits one qubit or two qubits is

229
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,740
quantum cryptography and we've had

230
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,800
working Quantum crypto systems since the

231
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,720
early 2000s

232
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,560
they um they allow two parties to agree

233
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,800
on a basically a one-time pad that they

234
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,600
get a sequence of ones and zeros that

235
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,800
mathematically provably to our

236
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,080
understanding of quantum physics nobody

237
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,320
else in the universe can share

238
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,940
um these systems do not provide

239
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,399
authentication so most of those is most

240
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,420
of the

241
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,880
the quantum cryptography systems

242
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,200
actually use something like

243
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,959
diffie-hellman or RSA on top of it to

244
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,640
authenticate the Stream

245
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,440
that's okay because you're

246
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,019
authenticating it in real time and if

247
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,580
somebody actually had a quantum computer

248
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,560
and captured your authentication stream

249
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,920
they could decrypt it in you know 20 30

250
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,360
years whenever those machines are

251
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,660
available it doesn't matter

252
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,899
uh the quantum encryption is very

253
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,839
popular in some places but

254
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,600
um it it the the U.S national security

255
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,580
agency has said it's not needed in the

256
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,620
United States no and one of the things

257
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,260
that was pretty remarkable in your book

258
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,880
was

259
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,800
specifically thinking about the promise

260
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,019
for quantum computers and in physics

261
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,260
simulation and designing drugs and

262
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,720
catalysts and things like that you want

263
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,420
to talk a little bit about sort of where

264
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,540
the near-term promise was yeah so in the

265
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,680
near term

266
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
quantum computers are good for one thing

267
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,740
and that is getting papers in published

268
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,800
in prestigious scientific journals

269
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,600
um the second thing that they're

270
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,339
reasonably good at but we don't know for

271
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,800
how much longer is they're they're

272
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,860
reasonably good at getting funding but

273
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,640
um

274
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,680
we may be heading towards a Quantum

275
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,899
winter if these machines don't pay off

276
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,240
if you remember AI winter we went

277
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,160
through two of those before AI really

278
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,339
blossomed and and the same thing could

279
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,860
easily happen on the quantum stage but

280
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,339
the the actual useful applications that

281
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,640
we've that we know will work once we

282
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,399
have a machine that's big enough is

283
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,380
feynman's idea of using Quantum machines

284
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,100
to simulate physics and chemistry and we

285
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,959
call those machines Quantum simulators

286
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,300
which is a bad name but I didn't make it

287
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,600
up and because Quantum simulators also

288
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,180
means we're simulating quantum computers

289
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,940
with conventional computers

290
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,160
you can download python code that will

291
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,120
do that

292
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,680
and the the other useful application is

293
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,680
optimization we now have some some

294
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,420
proofs that Quantum optimization uh is

295
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,459
provably better than some of our current

296
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,860
optimization techniques so with a

297
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,260
large-scale quantum computer you could

298
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,839
do certain optimizations that take

299
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,600
longer on classical computers

300
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
before we get to the five myths in the

301
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,320
book

302
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,180
one of the things that really struck me

303
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,019
was of Quantum sensing of quantum

304
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,760
Computing of quantum Quantum

305
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,459
Communications Quantum sensing was where

306
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,740
you all you and Chris came out saying

307
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,180
this is what you're going to see this is

308
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,380
what you need to be thinking about this

309
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,180
is actually required before you can do

310
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,920
those other things can you talk a little

311
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,079
bit about yeah well so

312
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,720
who cares had an MRI

313
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,459
all right so every one of you has been

314
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,519
inside a large-scale Quantum sensor and

315
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,320
and if you think about what MRIs they're

316
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,180
doing it's pretty phenomenal they can

317
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,920
like look inside your body in 3D

318
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,320
and distinguish one kind of atom from

319
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,480
another kind of atom

320
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,639
um that's magic right you know it's not

321
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,660
like x-rays where they're passing a um

322
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,600
and you know photons dangerous cancer

323
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,180
causing photons through your body and

324
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,279
and looking at how may get through MRIs

325
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,779
are doing something else and what

326
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,100
they're doing is they're looking at the

327
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,459
spin changes on on electrons that are

328
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,279
floating around the um the nuclei that

329
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,660
matter

330
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,440
um

331
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,279
in when I learned MRI we called it NMR

332
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,399
nuclear magnetic resonance but to we we

333
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,500
had to get rid of that nuclear word to

334
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,680
make people accept it in in the outside

335
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,720
world because they you know no radiation

336
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
but it's nuclear

337
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,579
um I was gonna say when I was in an MRI

338
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,860
I remember the problem set from my

339
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,260
Berkeley Quantum graduate Quantum class

340
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,440
on nuclear magnetic resonance and it was

341
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,500
Twice The Nightmare so so we have the

342
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,899
the story of the first MRI uh in the

343
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,420
book and it's funny that the the the lab

344
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,980
where they developed it they were sure

345
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,139
it was going to work but the the

346
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,579
question was who's going to be the test

347
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,079
subject so normally you would like use

348
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,480
up a dead pig or something but they put

349
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
a graduate student in the machine

350
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,959
they were really they did

351
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,940
um they were going to put a the faculty

352
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,800
member in but but the faculty member had

353
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,620
too much fat and and it

354
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,839
the early machine didn't work very well

355
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,000
through all those layers of fat

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,579
um so it's fun but that technology has

357
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:47,040
only been out since the seven days so

358
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,660
you know we're nearing on a little more

359
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,579
than 50 years

360
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,920
um but we've been using Quantum sensing

361
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,600
for a long time another application of

362
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,320
quantum sensing are atomic clocks so

363
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,839
Quantum sensing makes precise time

364
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,120
possible and if you have precise time

365
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,920
and you have a constellation of

366
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,540
satellites going around the planet you

367
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,779
can get time in position

368
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:12,720
and then there's uh the sense of maybe

369
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,519
building machines that can do dead

370
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,920
reckoning with Quantum sensing so we're

371
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,260
going to begin to see these payoffs that

372
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,880
are what we have been seeing these

373
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,399
payoffs with Quantum sensing and they're

374
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,440
going to get better like technology that

375
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
can literally see through walls instead

376
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
of seen through people or really precise

377
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,839
measuring of reflected photons

378
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,760
distinguishing photons that that you

379
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,459
sent because they're entangled

380
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,260
um and photons that you didn't scent

381
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,120
because they're not entangled with your

382
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,860
source and that's called Quantum radar

383
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,139
and there was a lot of excitement about

384
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,420
using Quantum radar to defeat stealth

385
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,639
and if I knew anything about that I

386
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,040
couldn't talk about it well and if

387
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
someone in the slack wouldn't mind

388
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,699
there's a Twitter thread where someone

389
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,100
describes all the sensing packages in

390
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,680
the high Mars multiple launching rocket

391
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,199
system that we've sent to Ukraine and

392
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,360
there's quite a bit of tech in there one

393
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,399
of which is a ring laser which you

394
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,139
mentioned in passing which is

395
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,660
essentially a laser that's shooting in a

396
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,760
circle triangle whatever and it can tell

397
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,880
based on orientation exactly where it is

398
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,100
with unbelievable precision and those

399
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,600
are in each one of those things there's

400
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,820
a lot of military yeah and one of my big

401
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,560
surprises in working on the book was

402
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,440
that you can now order ring lasers from

403
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,600
China for a few you know fifty to a

404
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,339
hundred dollars or a few hundred dollars

405
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,560
but yeah basically yeah it's it's three

406
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,320
mirrors and a laser and and it looks at

407
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,420
the chain engine interference patterns

408
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,639
as it slowly rotates the left or to the

409
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,720
right clockwise or counterclockwise

410
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,300
because the the photons don't rotate but

411
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,699
the mirrors are rotating and even though

412
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,320
the photons are moving really really

413
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,779
fast now now remember photons aren't

414
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,519
actually moving they're just probability

415
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,880
waves in a complex wave space and they

416
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,240
don't really exist until you sense them

417
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,660
protons but nothing does right like we

418
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,699
don't exist we're just probability

419
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,040
functions in a complex number space

420
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,500
metaphysics physicist physics Professor

421
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,900
who said photons are two-dimensional

422
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,419
things that we travel through that

423
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,160
that's another way of thinking about

424
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,859
them yeah okay so so let's get into

425
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,919
these myths and facts absolutely so myth

426
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,500
one humankind is at the precipice of

427
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,799
inventing large-scale quantum computers

428
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,540
yeah when people say large silicone

429
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,460
computers 10 million have to ask them

430
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,280
what do you mean by that right so a lot

431
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,320
of these physics simulations could be

432
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,900
done with machines with thousands of

433
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
noisy qubits

434
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,140
um you just keep running the equations

435
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,360
and you look and you get a distribution

436
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,760
of results because with cryptography

437
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,240
there's only one correct result

438
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,120
with cryptanalysis but with um with

439
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,400
sensing with with trying to model

440
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,460
um uh chemical reactions you're you're

441
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,160
okay with with that distribution

442
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,640
so the the national academies put out a

443
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,160
report and and they sensed that they

444
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,780
said in the report a few years like

445
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,520
three to five years still we have

446
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,360
machines that are quantum simulators and

447
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,880
I think that the in the IEEE publication

448
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,400
that's the current issue I think

449
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,340
um the the machines that IBM is bringing

450
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,799
out are either good enough to begin to

451
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,380
do Quantum simulation or like one

452
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,900
generation short two generations short

453
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,539
of of being able to do that it depends

454
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,700
what you emulate too right hundreds or

455
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,780
thousands of

456
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,539
cute not these are hundreds to thousands

457
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,600
not hundreds of thousands

458
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,520
yeah

459
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,340
okay so but if if you if like large

460
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,260
scale you mean something big enough to

461
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,080
crack an RSA key

462
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,840
um you know what do you mean humanity is

463
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,760
on the precipice right yeah on on

464
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,460
geological time we certainly are

465
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,740
um Tern said the duration of the

466
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,220
Republic sure but in our lifetimes you

467
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,840
know maybe some of the younger people in

468
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,220
the audience uh

469
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,520
that I'm I'm I could be surprised right

470
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,580
we could discover that a new algorithm

471
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,299
has been invented for factoring

472
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,799
tomorrow some

473
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,880
organization somewhere on the planet

474
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,740
might have a better algorithm for

475
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,919
factoring today so let's let's just work

476
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,980
that out for 25 seconds pretend that

477
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,320
there's some organization that employs a

478
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,620
lot of mathematicians that

479
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,020
and they don't speak English which has

480
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,240
come up with a better way for factoring

481
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,760
on classical computers maybe all their

482
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,700
work on Quantum has given them insight

483
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,100
into better ways to Factor on classical

484
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,039
machines so that organization now has a

485
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,500
problem right because it means that they

486
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,600
can decrypt messages that they've

487
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,179
recorded but what can they do with that

488
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,679
information because if they start

489
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,620
revealing that information then they

490
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,179
lose their advantage because people

491
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,760
realize what they can do this this is

492
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,500
the same

493
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,080
um conundrum that the English faced in

494
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,120
World War II when they could decrypt the

495
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,820
Enigma but they couldn't actually

496
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,380
operationalize much of the intelligence

497
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,240
from being able to decrypt Enigma

498
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,380
because they didn't want to be able to

499
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,260
reveal that they could decrypt Enigma so

500
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,260
it's it's it's a problem so some

501
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,700
organization might be able to do that

502
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,580
now we think it's unlikely just because

503
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,720
organizations have a real hard time

504
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,000
maintaining Secrets yeah and even the

505
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,520
IEEE article was pointing to to IBM

506
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,760
having in the network case maybe

507
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,000
two or three thousand qubits by 2025 or

508
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,280
2026 but that does seem maybe not

509
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,440
geological but very slow I don't even

510
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,919
know how many of these machines IBM has

511
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,679
um and we we don't know what IBM has

512
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,380
working we only know what IBM has chosen

513
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,919
to reveal

514
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,100
two

515
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,260
quantum computers can try all solutions

516
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,580
at once

517
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,100
yeah it turns out that's not the way

518
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,059
they work

519
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,039
um if they did then they would be you

520
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,780
know non-deterministic computers it

521
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,080
could solve NP hard Problems by

522
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
exploring the entire State space but

523
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
that's just not the way they work uh

524
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,799
many many people have described them as

525
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,760
working that way but um they don't

526
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,039
sorry

527
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,140
you can't throw Infinity gates at this

528
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,700
Cube well it would be super cool right

529
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,380
like the the way you know if you

530
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,179
believed in the many worlds hypothesis

531
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:43,380
of of of quantum mechanics which is that

532
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,419
every time there's a choice the universe

533
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,480
Forks so there's like a really large

534
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,179
number of universes and and we just

535
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,980
happen to be in the particular Universe

536
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,679
where all these decisions were made I do

537
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,179
not believe in the many worlds

538
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,640
hypothesis but it's completely valid

539
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,260
because there's no way to disprove it

540
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,440
yeah um I love things we can't improve

541
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,299
yeah

542
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,539
um so myth three all encryption will be

543
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,159
unscrambled when Quantum Computing

544
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,539
arrives it'll be like a light switch

545
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,080
Yeah so let's let's let's drill deep on

546
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,320
that one now that the the Google paper

547
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,320
which I I highly recommend says that if

548
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
they had their 20 million noisy qubits

549
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,460
that they could keep in superposition

550
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,380
for eight hours

551
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,360
um they would get one encryption key

552
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,140
right so you you could crack one signing

553
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,900
key and then you could distribute kernel

554
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,340
updates that looked like they were

555
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,080
properly signed

556
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,600
um but if the threat model that people

557
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,240
are concerned with is some foreign

558
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,520
adversary recording all of our

559
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,640
conversations and like every Zoom

560
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,580
connection every voice over IP

561
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,220
communication every web page that gets

562
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,380
downloaded recording them all having

563
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,419
them in some big database and then being

564
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,059
able to decide which of those

565
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,179
conversations to decrypt on the this

566
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,460
machine that takes eight hours per per

567
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,860
key well

568
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,679
uh the first problem is you have this uh

569
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,500
this uh prioritization problem you have

570
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,600
this deconfliction problem you don't

571
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,700
want to spend your resources on

572
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,220
something that you don't need to do

573
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,600
um you have this targeting problem

574
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,000
because it's really hard to distinguish

575
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,740
each of those conversations and figure

576
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,159
out which is the correct one so even as

577
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,260
it's it's the case now that like we

578
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,140
don't use uh you know 64-bit encryption

579
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,039
because it can be cracked realistically

580
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:42,900
it's it's hard to crack 64-bit

581
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,120
encryption it's not just something you

582
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,140
can do on your iPad in in a second so

583
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,419
um so there's some security but for

584
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,200
National Security it's we we're afraid

585
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,840
they are afraid

586
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,880
you need to get access to the encrypted

587
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,500
Communications and so oh that's easy

588
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,320
yeah so yeah like you know like it's

589
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,880
going through the air right you know

590
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,860
just set up some listening posts large

591
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,380
facilities in Utah that maybe so they

592
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,460
record it

593
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,320
um but if you want to have a listening

594
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,880
bus like you know who doesn't have a

595
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,919
listening Post in their pocket right you

596
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:18,179
know it's just a question of recording

597
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,500
the stuff that's going through the air

598
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,100
but but recording you know storing it

599
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,480
for an extended period of time now

600
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,159
you're talking about money

601
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,960
so um

602
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,580
myth four

603
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,260
Quantum cryptography and Quantum

604
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,780
Communications will be invulnerable to

605
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,100
attack

606
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,440
so I mentioned that there are in fact

607
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,419
commercial products out there that do

608
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:42,840
Quantum cryptography you you run it over

609
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,840
a fiber optic you can get 100 kilometers

610
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,140
I think and and we have a shared key

611
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,080
stream that we can use in in practice we

612
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,659
will use that shared key stream to

613
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,179
encrypt a link in crypter we're going to

614
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,940
make it our AES 256 key and we're going

615
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,179
to change that key every five seconds

616
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,280
and and that is what commercial

617
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,220
equipment will do for you today

618
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,940
um

619
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,039
so why don't we recommend those things

620
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,780
or why doesn't NSA recommend those

621
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,500
things

622
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,140
um well they might be vulnerable to side

623
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,559
Channel attacks uh you know the that's

624
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,780
hard to defend against and and we don't

625
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,720
know if those machines are good at that

626
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,539
uh we we know from many people who do

627
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:28,860
this kind of thing they say it's much

628
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,200
easier to go around the encryption so if

629
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,600
you can get like an implant on your iPad

630
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,539
then we don't need to um we don't need

631
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,760
to crack the encryption keys right and

632
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,039
there are companies that sell implants

633
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,159
for your iPad commercially to law

634
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,860
enforcement so you know we should assume

635
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,480
that everything on your iPad is being

636
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,299
sent to some organization other than

637
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,279
Apple makes me think of Post-it notes

638
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,380
that say decrypt here which is yeah yeah

639
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,299
about about 10 years ago we started

640
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,580
learning there's a lot of options for

641
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,220
getting around encryption and just as

642
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,740
with with

643
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,480
Quantum cryptography you have to get

644
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,220
around the encryption because you can't

645
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,799
crack that that stream

646
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,799
okay myth five five America is at the

647
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,840
head of the pack in Quantum Technologies

648
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,279
yeah

649
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,799
yeah and how much do we actually know

650
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,900
yeah so

651
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,360
who here thinks that the US is ahead of

652
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,640
the pack in quantum

653
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,179
so nobody here believes that

654
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:31,980
you know there's like there's so many

655
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,419
other countries out there working out

656
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,919
like China

657
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,600
um and um

658
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,179
and then the the U.S programs are all

659
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:41,100
basically multinational programs right

660
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,720
you know so Google has a program

661
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,679
alphabet and Microsoft has a program and

662
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,720
um IBM has a program but they're all

663
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,880
multinational teams

664
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,740
um it's really just the Chinese that

665
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,440
have a national team and other countries

666
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,840
that have unannounced programs that you

667
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,730
know might be there so

668
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,179
[Music]

669
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:00,960
um

670
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
if I was going to build you know advisor

671
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,760
uh you know a rogue Nation do they want

672
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,340
to build a quantum computer or build an

673
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,020
atomic bomb I would of course say build

674
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,299
an atomic bomb because it's much easier

675
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,299
to do right like that's 1940s technology

676
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,880
so yeah absolutely think about that like

677
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,600
nuclear weapons or 1940s technology

678
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,360
that's kind of cool go ahead I was going

679
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,760
to say uh there's some still some

680
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,740
difficulties in separating isotopes that

681
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,140
actually it's gotten really easy yeah

682
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,299
compared to Quantum Computing and you

683
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:35,279
don't have to right so like this was the

684
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,400
big breakthrough so we researched a lot

685
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,159
about Iris about nuclear weapons on this

686
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,500
book because that one of the hypothesis

687
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,840
is that the difference between chemical

688
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,120
based weapons and Quantum based weapons

689
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,700
nuclear bombs is similar to the what

690
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,900
we're going to have with this difference

691
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,539
between classical computers and quantum

692
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,580
computers and in that there's this

693
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,679
technology transformation story that

694
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,799
with Quantum the first machine that you

695
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,240
build the first working machine is

696
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,179
fantastically expensive and then you

697
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,179
spend the next 10 to 20 years lowering

698
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,179
the cost of building those those

699
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:14,460
machines and then once you've got the

700
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,980
cost down to a reasonable basis you can

701
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,720
blast out as many as you want and that's

702
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
what we did with nuclear weapons and and

703
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,059
that's what we did with MRI machines and

704
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:25,020
it's probably what's going to happen

705
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,520
with quantum computers the first

706
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,140
machines are going to be the first

707
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,940
useful machines they're still going to

708
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,679
be very expensive and then we're going

709
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,480
to work in getting that that cost down

710
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,659
now in terms of of Isotopes right that

711
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:38,159
you know that we have two kinds of bombs

712
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,679
we have the bombs that use uranium and

713
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,900
the bombs that use plutonium not talking

714
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,260
about dirty bombs here right so getting

715
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,179
plutonium out of the the atomic pile is

716
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:50,159
easy you just have an atomic bile with

717
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,559
some uranium and it makes plutonium for

718
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,659
you and then you use chemistry and you

719
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,720
remove the plutonium from the uranium

720
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,940
um and that that was the first bomb that

721
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,500
we blew up we knew that that would work

722
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,559
because like the the math is easier it's

723
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,820
the

724
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,860
um no excuse me I'm sorry I have It

725
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,620
reversed that that's the we didn't have

726
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,539
a lot of plutonium so we had to work on

727
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,820
the uranium separation and that's harder

728
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,220
to get right but the bomb is an easier

729
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,600
bomb to design

730
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,740
so

731
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,460
um

732
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,460
in in the book yeah mention classical

733
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,320
Computing benefits from some virtual

734
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,899
this is what I didn't tell you about uh

735
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,720
benefits from some virtuous Cycles in

736
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,419
terms of yeah speeding up is that still

737
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,220
the case here with so let's talk about

738
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,159
virtuous Cycles right so the the virtual

739
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,640
circle is is this idea from largely

740
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Computing and silicon that the the

741
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,159
technology that you are building you can

742
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,860
then use to make the technology better

743
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,740
right so our our advances in

744
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,659
semiconductor manufacturing and in

745
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,899
Computing in the 50s made it easier to

746
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,940
build better machines in the 60s which

747
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,980
made it easier to build better machines

748
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,840
and we're still writing that virtuous

749
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,899
circle of better and better classical

750
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,940
machines it's a nanometer and Beyond

751
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,940
right it is phenomenal that apple is

752
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,799
making consumer products with three

753
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,440
nanometer feature size because like when

754
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,179
I was in college we were told that there

755
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,460
would be tunneling Quantum tunneling um

756
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,919
from one Trace to the other trace and it

757
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,140
turns out like this 30 nanometers is is

758
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,200
30 hydrogen atoms lined up next to each

759
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,840
other but apparently you still don't get

760
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,039
um

761
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,520
you you still don't actually it's 15. 15

762
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,980
or 30. um you still don't get Quantum

763
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,260
tunneling even at that scale

764
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,899
um but uh

765
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:48,299
uh you know are we going to get a

766
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,360
virtuous circle with um Quantum maybe

767
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,640
right so if we can use our Quantum

768
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,120
machines to simulate quantum physics and

769
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,520
use that to build better Quantum

770
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,380
substrates better Quantum processors uh

771
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,640
yes

772
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,480
but it's much more limited than we saw

773
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,120
with silicon

774
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,120
so a grab bag of things

775
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,299
um Workforce challenges export control

776
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,940
issues can you talk about these things

777
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,100
these are sort of a little more esoteric

778
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,500
yeah and so like the biggest Workforce

779
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,120
problem we have in the in this country

780
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,580
is our immigration problem

781
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,840
um now that we don't have open borders

782
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,179
we don't make it easy for people who

783
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,940
have technological skills to come to the

784
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,059
US and contribute to our economy and

785
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,679
that affects all aspects of technology

786
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,559
and until we address that problem uh

787
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,820
we're going to have very serious

788
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,120
problems with Workforce and and it's not

789
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,480
just that oh we have to convince every

790
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,899
single native born American to

791
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,240
study Quantum Computing it's like

792
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,919
there's a lot of other options in our

793
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,500
society

794
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,179
and and it would be better to draw from

795
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:10,919
a worldwide population they certainly

796
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,860
want to come here but in terms of

797
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,919
getting people to pursue this

798
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:17,880
um

799
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,159
the the people I know who are pursuing

800
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,399
this don't think it's risky but that's a

801
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,260
selection bias the people who think that

802
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,659
it's a risky career choice aren't going

803
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,340
into it

804
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,059
um the the cup the quantum companies say

805
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:36,059
that they can't hire enough people

806
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,520
and that there just are not people who

807
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,340
are who are qualified now at the same

808
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,320
time it's going to get a lot easier to

809
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,059
program quantum computers within the

810
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:48,299
next five to ten years right now it's as

811
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,640
if everybody who writes a Quantum

812
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,520
program is designing their own

813
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,260
instruction set

814
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,200
uh and that's because these machines are

815
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,460
so small that that every possible

816
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,260
feature in that machine has to be

817
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,240
utilized

818
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,899
um

819
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,120
but when the machines get bigger when

820
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,880
they will hold superposition for a

821
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,340
longer period of time then what we're

822
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,260
going to be able to have is a

823
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,179
standardized instruction set we're going

824
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:21,299
to have better high level languages and

825
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,360
it will be easier for for people like me

826
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,000
to write programs that run on quantum

827
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
computers should I want to do that or to

828
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,399
Simply say oh I want a Quantum Optimizer

829
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,760
and drop it down now that Quantum

830
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,440
Optimizer is going to have to compete

831
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,260
with the very best commercial optimizers

832
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,659
and if anybody here has not used a

833
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:44,340
commercial Optimizer let me recommend

834
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,260
that you look into this area it's

835
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,179
fascinating what's happened in the past

836
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:50,340
10 years there's so much stuff that you

837
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,600
might want to do that you can just have

838
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,140
the optimizer do and it's done so the

839
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,179
commercial optimizers are so good that

840
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,820
that many organizations won't need to

841
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,980
move to a Quantum Optimizer fascinating

842
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,580
so please line up at the mic if you have

843
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,040
any questions if maybe this is oh and my

844
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,399
cough is asthma so don't worry about it

845
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,339
one final question I understand the US

846
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,619
Congress recently passed the quantum

847
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,960
Computing cyber security preparedness

848
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,899
act can you talk about the relevance of

849
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,879
that and what it does

850
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,679
this is the policy question for those

851
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,199
who don't understand the physics

852
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,899
so that that was a surprise

853
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,599
um was this signed also you told me

854
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,359
about it I told you about it yes it was

855
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:39,239
passed into law I don't remember

856
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,280
um I think it it's it's a funding thing

857
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,440
but oh yeah the funding thing yeah we're

858
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,699
going to put more government money into

859
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,139
it it's great

860
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,639
um

861
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,679
no the more government money we put into

862
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,418
things the better

863
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,399
um that if you look at the amount of

864
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,460
money that NSF has put into research uh

865
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,380
normalized against a number of

866
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,760
researchers number of research

867
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,859
institutions number of competing

868
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:03,839
priorities

869
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,839
um just now we're at like a half to a

870
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,060
third of where we were 20 30 years ago

871
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,599
so anything yes that that's a funding

872
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:14,520
bill there's also a post-quantum

873
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,740
preparedness element where agencies

874
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,859
thank you build some of that into what

875
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,540
they're thinking yeah so Quantum key

876
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,280
exchange yeah I always have to be

877
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,839
careful though because you know I've had

878
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:27,000
all these I I worked for the government

879
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,040
until last August

880
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,940
um

881
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,099
so right now yeah I can say anything

882
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,240
here right

883
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,339
um so right now there's

884
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,880
um a standardization process at Nest

885
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,000
um to come up with a post Quantum a set

886
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,040
of post-quantum algorithms which are

887
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,160
algorithms based on math that cannot be

888
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,220
broken by Shores algorithm so not based

889
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,619
on factoring not based on elliptic curve

890
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,859
not based on discrete logs

891
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:58,800
based on method that may not be as well

892
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,980
vetted as factoring which we have you

893
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,599
know centuries of experience thinking

894
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,780
about one of the the nist proposals was

895
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,619
found to be not found to be breakable

896
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:12,599
shortly after it was published but there

897
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:15,540
are four candidate algorithms now

898
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,140
and what's going to happen is as soon as

899
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,680
this set decides on on the final set of

900
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,079
algorithms and the parameters to use

901
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,180
them with there's going to be this mad

902
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,040
rush to

903
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,460
sell new things to the government so

904
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,839
that the government can immediately

905
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,480
adopt these new algorithms and it's just

906
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,460
there's so much money to be made selling

907
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,380
things so the government and one of the

908
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,119
things that that legislation says is

909
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,220
that the government has to buy it

910
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,000
um that we have to be yeah it I want to

911
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
sell that I'm sorry I would like to sell

912
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,320
that yeah there you go right so like if

913
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,880
you've ever seen those PIV cards that

914
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,520
have the smart cards and the chips all

915
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,260
of those have to be changed they all

916
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,540
have to have post Quantum cryptography

917
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,000
algorithms in them and the keys are are

918
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,099
like 10 times bigger or bigger and they

919
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,859
they take more CPU power and and so it's

920
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,900
just going to be huge amounts of your

921
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,359
taxpayers spent taxpayer dollars by Jim

922
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,480
Alto stuff thank you Simpson for joining

923
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,680
us thank you so much
