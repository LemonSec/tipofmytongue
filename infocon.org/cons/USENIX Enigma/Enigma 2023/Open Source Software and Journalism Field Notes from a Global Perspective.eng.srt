1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:04,199
foreign

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,359
okay so I'm Harlow

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,160
um and uh thank you so much for your

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,779
introduction I'll talk a little bit

5
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,400
about freedom of the press Foundation

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,779
which actually

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,300
um on our board includes Edward Snowden

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,359
and also um Daniel Ellsberg of the

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,159
Pentagon papers fame

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,700
um who actually in um response to the

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,320
lovely question that you answered so

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,780
well about how expensive it is to be a

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,000
whistleblower Daniel actually did say to

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,320
us one time

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,040
um that uh people in these situations

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,500
are usually prepared to do things like

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,960
lose their lives but they're never ever

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,420
prepared to lose their livelihoods and

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,760
this is why the work that we do in

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,680
protecting whistleblowers and other

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,079
sources is incredibly important okay so

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,120
this is how we do it secure job we have

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,479
an engineering team that has secure job

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,799
we're going to talk about that this is a

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,979
a newsroom appliance that sits in a

26
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,080
growing number of newsrooms across the

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,700
globe that facilitates technical

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,700
technically Anonymous communication

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,040
between potential sources and a

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,780
particular Newsroom this is just one

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,400
software project that our Engineers work

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,360
on we also have advocacy where we have

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,820
folks who blog all day about why these

34
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,380
things are important I'm sorry no they

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,360
do amazing work they also work on

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,400
legislation and things like that and

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,400
also the Press Freedom tracker which is

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,180
our own little Newsroom that actually

39
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,799
documents cases where members of the

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,619
press have had their right to report

41
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,439
impinged upon which is not only like uh

42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,200
you know run like a newsroom but it also

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,479
has an API that we expose so people can

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,820
make quantitative

45
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,079
um uh you know conclusions about how

46
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,640
members are the Press are being abused

47
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,079
which is a really cool tool love it

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,640
we'll get back to that later and then

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,740
there's my team services not only am I

50
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,199
Mi our organization CSO I'm also the

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,660
director of digital security where I run

52
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,459
the services program we have a small

53
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,120
team that these are they they're lovely

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,739
hi guys

55
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,020
um where we do uh digital security

56
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,379
training we write a lot of manuals

57
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,840
um we do security auditing and

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,940
Consulting for newsrooms of a variety of

59
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,220
sizes in order to make sure that

60
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,140
journalists have the tools that they

61
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,480
need in order to maintain that part of

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
the bargain when they are working with

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,720
whistleblowers and other sensitive

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,360
sources our trainings and Consultants

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,220
programs have taken us all over the

66
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,800
place these are just the locations that

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,420
we can tell you about and today I'm

68
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,920
going to speak to you about the things

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,480
that we've done that I can tell you

70
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,360
about on the record okay but first off

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,280
and I think the other two panels have

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,900
already spoken to this is what I like to

73
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,420
call the asymmetry of preparedness which

74
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,959
is that as a journalist they're or sorry

75
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,360
for a whistleblower there may be as we

76
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,980
saw in our first presentation an

77
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,900
internal process for whistleblowing but

78
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,120
nobody trusts it because as the

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,280
panelists did mention there's a sense of

80
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,459
utility and then there's a sense of

81
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,440
retaliation that they they do not trust

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,260
will protect them in the end for these

83
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,420
Services where you you know are going to

84
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,300
upload documentation uploading a doc is

85
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,700
not as easy as it seems on a variety of

86
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,260
platforms and we're going to talk about

87
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,019
those limitations uh going forward and

88
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,360
also I think yeah

89
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,300
yes and these other two presentations uh

90
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,640
whether your job as a whistleblower is

91
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,840
like your job is not to be a

92
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,340
whistleblower your job is to work in

93
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,080
Congress your job is to work for the

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,640
Department of Sanitation or the school

95
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,920
board whistleblowing is never your job

96
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,500
and so you're not going to be good at it

97
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,879
you as a journalist on the other hand

98
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,580
have to realize that the source is not

99
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,620
always going to be as lawyered up as you

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,959
are in high profile cases those that

101
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,700
actually work within you know government

102
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,060
institutions Etc or large Enterprises

103
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,459
that might not that's there's so much

104
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,860
asymmetry there

105
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,080
um and also in terms of like Tech the

106
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,640
technologies that you use in order to

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
facilitate these conversations your

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,298
source is never going to have as good

109
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,579
endpoint security as you do so meaning

110
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,979
what phone are they using when they

111
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,960
reach out to you on signal right do they

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,479
even know what full disk encryption is

113
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,120
um Etc did they literally just like do

114
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,740
that on their work computer that's

115
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,780
managed by their it Department you're

116
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,680
done

117
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,440
um and so uh these are the things that

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,180
you have to kind of address as a

119
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,520
journalist before you can do that so

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
we've gone we've come a long way a

121
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,660
couple of years ago motherboard released

122
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,340
the guide to not getting hacked which

123
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,320
has like a lot of excellent ideas that

124
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,540
they put forth into the public at large

125
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,300
in order to get people normally people

126
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,580
thinking about from a very safe Commons

127
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,440
of the internet thinking about what

128
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,080
tools are required in order to have more

129
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,419
confidential Communications you also see

130
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,120
that more and more newspapers themselves

131
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,520
are starting to instruct the public at

132
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,560
large usually you go to where forever

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,380
like slash tips or this one

134
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,000
propublica.org leak to us and there are

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,860
detailed instructions for a potential

136
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,840
whistleblower who is reading that

137
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,780
newspaper exactly what to do if ever the

138
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,479
day comes that they need to be a source

139
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,699
which is awesome we help news

140
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,500
organizations build these tip Pages by

141
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,479
the way so if you are at a news organ

142
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,639
you don't have one yet let us know but

143
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,320
we're going to talk about open source

144
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,400
and um its usage in building these types

145
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,860
of Technologies and why it's fundamental

146
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,259
first and foremost no one actually does

147
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,120
have a budget they really don't I've

148
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,919
worked and we'll I'll show you later

149
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,500
I've worked with Reuters before to break

150
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,039
big big stories and they their

151
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,660
investigative unit which is like small

152
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,060
couple people they can't ask for money

153
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,860
to get like you know a suite that will

154
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,400
do all of like you know the redactions

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,620
or the ocring or whatever they're not

156
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,699
they're just gonna be like I don't know

157
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,620
can can you get something off of Linux

158
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,960
and just like put it on a you know so

159
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,460
these are actually the tools that we

160
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,320
work with not to mention the use cases

161
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,000
for smaller news organizations where

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,639
they're doing local investigations

163
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,440
um there isn't really very much trust in

164
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
Enterprise Solutions and uh like when

165
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,039
you think about the difference between

166
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,319
signal and WhatsApp

167
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,220
um we know what WhatsApp has had to do

168
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,380
regarding legal intercept that my or the

169
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,000
way that they use metadata or you know

170
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
its ties to your entire social graph

171
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,220
that makes it 10 times different than um

172
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,220
then signal for these like very very

173
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,380
small nuanced reasons and we'll get to

174
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,880
that in a minute so we don't trust

175
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,680
Enterprise and

176
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,259
um these are so many weird edge cases

177
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,319
that uh yeah that there really isn't

178
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,020
like a or a corporate solution to

179
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,539
address these anyways and also finally I

180
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,400
do want to say that I come from the

181
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,720
culture there are a couple of people in

182
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,940
this room who also come from the culture

183
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,120
um which is that open source um is near

184
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,039
and dear to our hearts it comes from a

185
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,080
very deeply held philosophy that's

186
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,819
software should be free

187
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,020
um and that it should be done and

188
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,699
developed in the open and it should be

189
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,340
done with love for the communities that

190
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,800
you serve and so this is an ethos that

191
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,780
comes out of uh circumvention technology

192
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,479
we sometimes call it internet Freedom we

193
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,819
we sometimes call it hit us up if you

194
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,680
want to know more about that particular

195
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,819
ethos

196
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,259
okay

197
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,919
let's get into some tooling so we all

198
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,900
here know what asymmetric encryption

199
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,020
means right but to a journalist this

200
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,180
means totally different things

201
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,639
um so the first time anyone ever and I'm

202
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,020
not I'm just gonna Blaze through this

203
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,280
because it's so horrible

204
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,919
um pgp people are still trying to use

205
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,199
pgp but

206
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,900
um even like email is horrible uh I I

207
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,020
mean some people do offer like you know

208
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,020
email as like a leak to us option I

209
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,759
don't really recommend it but if you are

210
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,400
going to do it just know that

211
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,360
journalists need to know that things

212
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,340
like metadata like that problem is never

213
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,080
going to go away there's no forward

214
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,479
secrecy so if something if your key is

215
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,860
compromised all of your emails are

216
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,360
unlocked and not only yours but that of

217
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,699
the source uh there's this really

218
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,919
disturbing trend of people like who want

219
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,740
to be whistleblowers reaching out to a

220
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
journalist at I don't know like vice.com

221
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,620
with protonmail not knowing that your it

222
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,900
department has not configured you know

223
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,740
your email to accept

224
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,719
or accept encrypted email

225
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,179
because you don't have a pgp key

226
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,279
um or you know some some of them do but

227
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,140
uh people think that just because they

228
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,640
have a protonmail account that it's

229
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,100
automatically going to be arrive at

230
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,620
someone's Outlook server end-to-end

231
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,959
encrypted and that is definitely not the

232
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,220
case

233
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,860
um we do say that like you know like

234
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,500
it's just not really sustainable however

235
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,080
if you are going to do that journalists

236
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,240
need to know that they have tools like

237
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,339
mailvelope for instance that you can use

238
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,860
to shoehorn into

239
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,500
um your uh your web clients in order to

240
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,600
facilitate pgp if you don't want to take

241
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,120
the learn to painstakingly learn it from

242
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,339
the ground up using tools like enigmail

243
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,320
which actually is now part of

244
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,180
Thunderbird so that was a really really

245
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,240
big win for the gpg loving Community out

246
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,620
here and also the open pgp Group which

247
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,959
is also a product of our friends and the

248
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,820
internet Freedom space

249
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,519
um tackled the uh the danger that was

250
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,860
web of trust poised reasoning where you

251
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,540
know if you signed people's Keys like

252
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,459
add infinitum it would just clog up the

253
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,519
key servers making pgp unusable so this

254
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,380
is why open source was important in

255
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,480
giving people email if you still want to

256
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,380
use it

257
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,300
um but most people are actually not

258
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,399
doing that and instead they're moving to

259
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,600
the apps

260
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
um this is our plotting of like the

261
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
decision making Matrix that you should

262
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,160
have in your head when thinking of how

263
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,459
to communicate with someone using uh you

264
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,839
know various forms of encryption

265
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,959
preferably end-to-end encryption based

266
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,660
off of um you know two axes one at the

267
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,060
top or your vertical axes is you know

268
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,339
how well this is going to serve you in

269
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,200
having in maintaining confidentiality

270
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,959
and on our horizontal axis is how

271
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,880
applicable and how available it is to

272
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,980
the person that you want to talk to and

273
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,660
so I already mentioned the differences

274
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,420
between like WhatsApp and signal but

275
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,560
then when you think of things like

276
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,060
iMessage

277
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,300
um one of like the um uh biggest debates

278
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,240
with within the security Community has

279
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,500
to do with the fact that you can't

280
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,500
actually prove your um you know that you

281
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,180
are talking to who you want to be

282
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,800
talking to because there's no mechanism

283
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,800
within iMessage in order to prove that

284
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,940
you're not being manned in the middle

285
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,600
also it has been proven that um iMessage

286
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,240
has a whole lot of usage and data and

287
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,820
other metadata that can be subject to a

288
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,800
warrant a subpoena Etc whatever legal

289
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Tools in order to uh you know just

290
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,680
determine what device was in use at the

291
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,839
time an iMessage was being sent and from

292
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,000
a leak perspective or rather a leak

293
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,980
investigator's perspective especially on

294
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,500
Enterprise especially if you have a if

295
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,959
the employee in question under

296
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,480
investigation has a managed device they

297
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,959
have this and you don't even need um you

298
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,540
know like in in Enterprise you don't

299
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,980
need to prove someone did it you just

300
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,600
need the suspicion that someone did it

301
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,120
and that is how they get fired

302
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,120
okay so um people are using signal

303
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,180
that's it so far right now this is our

304
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,820
best defense and uh what are the

305
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,279
must-haves for an investigative unit um

306
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,440
in order to keep the story safe on the

307
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,060
way I'm gonna Blaze through this because

308
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,560
I'm looking at my time and it looks

309
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,000
miserable

310
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,160
um so we definitely do make sure that

311
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,959
people are verifying that they're uh

312
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,519
speaking to the people that they want to

313
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,980
speak to uh encouraging people to enable

314
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,440
disappearing messages for um particular

315
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,740
groups um investigative units uh being

316
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,899
very careful about signal death use of

317
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,060
signal desktop and at a very minimum

318
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,100
making sure that full disk encryption is

319
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,140
turned on and you have to make decisions

320
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,140
about who in it within a newsroom has

321
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,079
the ability to manage those devices

322
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,600
um using notes to self and also

323
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,579
instructing sources to use notes to self

324
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,640
uh in order to have an alternative for

325
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,800
note-taking which is great for you know

326
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,620
like uh taking voice notes images and

327
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,779
video which is something that can be

328
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,420
end-to-end encrypted and yet um across

329
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,860
all of the linked devices which is

330
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,480
something that you do not get if you're

331
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,100
using you know the notes app on your

332
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,839
iPhone

333
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,600
um another thing that is very important

334
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,820
especially from an Enterprise level is

335
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,060
uh using uh or using virtual phone

336
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,160
numbers to prevent you from giving out

337
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,139
your personal phone number to a source

338
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,480
or using um the same phone number across

339
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,300
multiple investigations and so in open

340
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,980
source actually there are two really

341
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,139
excellent libraries one is called signal

342
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,660
D the other one is called signal CLI

343
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,300
these are both Community maintained open

344
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,000
source libraries that wrap or that take

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
signals you know guts their key

346
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,800
libraries and allow you to create other

347
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,260
experiences that might help you do this

348
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,260
at scale if you have the stomach for it

349
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,459
so you have a leak right so what

350
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,680
um because it does not end with the um

351
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,959
the initial blowing of the whistle you

352
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,519
still have to communicate regularly

353
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,519
perhaps with your Source very often as a

354
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,839
journalist will come back to that

355
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,639
confidential source and say all right

356
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
you gave me this that says promise I

357
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
need you to go get this I need you to go

358
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,200
get this and this is how you do it so

359
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,579
you have to actually maintain this

360
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,139
conversation Jane

361
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:47,519
um you have to perform redactions

362
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,300
analysis and you have to also

363
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,639
disseminate materials between a number

364
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,560
of people within The Newsroom who may or

365
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,079
may not be trusted so that means is your

366
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,480
editor as good at this as you are now

367
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,459
that you've taken my class maybe not you

368
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,920
have to train everybody up so we have

369
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,420
first I'm going to talk about secure

370
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,639
drop which is our Flagship products

371
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,620
talked about it before

372
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,139
um a user or sorry a potential

373
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:16,500
whistleblower uses the Tor Browser in

374
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,540
order to go to a special webpage hosted

375
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:22,320
by the newspaper where upon submission

376
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,959
um the journalist then boots up tails

377
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,700
the operating system them and we'll talk

378
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,639
about that and then puts the submission

379
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,519
on a USB stick brings it to a very very

380
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,300
special computer via a sneaker net on an

381
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,040
air gap

382
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,680
in order to decrypt that with you know

383
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,579
basic GP pretty good privacy pgp there

384
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,560
it is it's pretty easy to do but it's so

385
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,360
cumbersome because people literally have

386
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,699
to take a USB stick from one computer

387
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,680
bring it over to another computer back

388
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,540
and forth before they even know whether

389
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,300
or not this is like a good

390
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,760
um you know document to follow up with

391
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,860
and the air gapping procedures are

392
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,380
ridiculous so what we did was we

393
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,660
actually have been investing a lot of

394
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,360
our engineering efforts in using the

395
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,940
Cube's operating system in order to

396
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,699
bring all of those functions together

397
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,920
cubes uh I'm gonna stoop oh yeah there's

398
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,240
also Global leaks but we don't have time

399
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,560
for that

400
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,220
um

401
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,500
I did want to talk about covid stuff

402
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,779
okay but keep that in mind

403
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:28,019
um that we're unifying that under one um

404
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,180
one machine

405
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,240
um so real quick detour about why covid

406
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,199
actually

407
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,360
um uh did a doozy we'll say on

408
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,880
on uh journalists this is me um uh real

409
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,500
picture of me it's not actually from The

410
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,000
New Yorker that is me during the entire

411
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,680
pandemic okay

412
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,160
um but we actually uh had to advise um

413
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,100
people how to continue using secure drop

414
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,720
given the fact that it does take like

415
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,820
physical access to a machine physical

416
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,300
security of servers Etc like that

417
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,880
um uh while doing that remotely from

418
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,220
home it's ridiculous

419
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,600
um and uh because that became untenable

420
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,639
uh people did not like journalists now

421
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,139
had to be at home did not have physical

422
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,139
access to their servers uh it definitely

423
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,060
became under like uh the the effects on

424
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,000
doing uh like sensitive beats like

425
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
National Security journalism or whatever

426
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,660
got increasingly difficult if not

427
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,060
impossible and according to journalist

428
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,800
sites spoken to

429
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,480
um there were a number of Investigations

430
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,639
that were sitting in you know like these

431
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,759
uh platforms like secure drop that had

432
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,560
to be or that led to investigations that

433
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,360
had to be put on hold or even shelved

434
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,459
indefinitely Because by the time people

435
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,740
were able to check their secure drops

436
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,699
the ship had sailed so far

437
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,459
um but okay so I wanted to take that

438
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:57,480
detour and now I'll talk about

439
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,899
um uh another thing that uh is

440
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,060
incredibly important within this entire

441
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,240
workflow is that uh what a journalist

442
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,359
does especially when working with um uh

443
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,640
documents of unknown provenance is to

444
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,380
say yeah just send it to me I'll open it

445
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,900
sure sure that's great people I.T

446
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,459
departments at newsrooms love to hear

447
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,260
that so

448
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,780
um we actually have used a variety of

449
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,720
Open Source tools and techniques and

450
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,699
workflows in order to make that safer

451
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,160
for the journalists the first is a near

452
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,200
and dear to our heart operating system

453
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,020
called Tails which is a live distro that

454
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,880
you could put on a USB stick and you can

455
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,340
literally check secure drop from you

456
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,419
know like a net cafe in in Cairo or you

457
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,059
know from your own home in lockdown and

458
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,559
you can also do a number of other things

459
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,179
on it which we'll talk about very

460
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,679
shortly

461
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,840
um there's also cubes my favorite

462
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,700
operating system in the entire world

463
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,400
where each window connects to the

464
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,900
internet in a different way VIA

465
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,059
different routes or not at all so I like

466
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,980
right here I'm connected to you know

467
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,620
unsafe Wi-Fi but through a proxy and

468
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,240
through with this and that and then in

469
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,919
another window no internet connection

470
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,620
whatsoever and so this means that you

471
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,880
can also create environments where

472
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,520
suspicious documents can be opened in

473
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,799
ephemeral and fully sandbox spaces

474
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,160
because when you kind of just close this

475
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,419
window in fact when I close this

476
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,660
presentation it never happened

477
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,400
it's pretty cool check it out

478
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,559
um open source it's something that we

479
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,539
advise on very very deeply and we have

480
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,880
raised money to encourage its

481
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,919
development there's also danger zones

482
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,020
sometimes people don't want to go as far

483
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,840
as this but danger zone is a really cool

484
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,039
project

485
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,260
um maintained built or maintained by us

486
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,520
as well

487
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,299
um created by first looks Micah Lee and

488
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,700
it pretty much allows you to do this on

489
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,919
a non-specialized environment so you can

490
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:54,960
do this on a Mac or Windows machine if

491
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,780
you'd like and it makes people a little

492
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,299
bit more confident about

493
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,179
um about their you know protecting their

494
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,580
network if someone on like a fleet of

495
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,320
computers is going to open up a random

496
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,500
document also has ocring

497
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,120
um but speaking of OCR and all those

498
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,520
things uh what are you going to do with

499
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,799
the stuff when you receive it how do you

500
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,419
work on that data so I'm going to

501
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,760
Spotlight a couple of projects I think

502
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,679
are really great the AP took this over

503
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,480
but this came out of Columbia's School

504
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,460
of Journalism or the Tau Center by

505
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,280
Jonathan stray called overview there's

506
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,780
also similarly aliff by occrp

507
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,700
um which and both of these are projects

508
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,980
that just literally allow you to you

509
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,340
know perform natural language processing

510
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,860
yes and um you know like heat mapping

511
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,260
and entity extraction and all this good

512
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,140
stuff in order to find heat within a

513
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,419
particular document so it might help you

514
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,299
get better get more out of the documents

515
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,520
that have been submitted to you there's

516
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,340
also recall old school really like Bare

517
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,260
Bones but it does the job still open

518
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,780
source still maintained by like one dude

519
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,640
give him love

520
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,320
um and all of these things can be

521
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,840
dockerized so or can containerized

522
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,700
however you want it to be installed in

523
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,799
an air-gapped environment and especially

524
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,900
Rico was really Nimble at that um a

525
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,400
couple of years ago friends of mine and

526
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,799
I worked all summer to put together this

527
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,840
package where we could just take random

528
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,820
open source software and put them into

529
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,059
tails with persistence I built this for

530
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,039
Reuters actually and this is the output

531
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
and I'm very that's like one of the

532
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,860
proudest achievements I've ever had in

533
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,760
my life just doing Tails oh I mean I

534
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,400
didn't write it I didn't write it I just

535
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,860
made an environment for them to do that

536
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,419
okay

537
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:45,120
um moving the late so yeah this is a lot

538
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,860
and so another thing is that I work with

539
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,020
media makers so I work with

540
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,000
um uh primarily documentary filmmakers

541
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,700
as well you'll notice signal you can't

542
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,460
receive like footage over signal

543
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,320
um secure drop Global leaks all of these

544
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,820
platforms they're really great but they

545
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,760
have a 500 megabyte cap on how much you

546
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,820
can submit so in which case you have to

547
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,220
find people um uh solutions for moving

548
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,600
weight and during covid this was

549
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,100
especially

550
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,740
um uh important because editing teams

551
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,299
like you would have an editing Suite in

552
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,460
London but filming was being done in

553
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,320
like China and like you know all of this

554
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,059
stuff and you had to find ways to make

555
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,500
it work

556
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,260
um so first and foremost we'll talk

557
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,520
about like collaboration I'm just going

558
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,220
to kind of Breeze through that Crypt pad

559
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,919
way better than Google Docs um so is

560
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,720
next Cloud both of these are options

561
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,580
that you can just spin up

562
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,380
um in order to uh you know have the

563
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,120
collaborative editing the file storage

564
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,100
the you know whatever the calendaring

565
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,900
the Excel spreadsheeting all of that

566
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,799
stuff

567
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:46,500
um but it's entirely open source

568
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,020
um doing interviews actually like you

569
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,880
could be working with a source um but

570
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,820
you want to take like let's say like

571
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,120
film-ish quality grade interviews with a

572
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,140
source

573
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,000
um for a documentary film we actually

574
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,159
like you know jitsi we might have all

575
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,539
used jitsy meet but what's cool about

576
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,520
Jitsu meet being open source is that you

577
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,860
can actually spin up your own servers on

578
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,559
domains that you own and Harden them in

579
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,120
such a way that you are enforcing

580
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,919
end-to-end encryption you are enforcing

581
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,600
like waiting rooms with passcodes and

582
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,460
like all of that good stuff um if you

583
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,740
just kind of take the moment to do so

584
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,600
um take the moment to do so get a little

585
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,919
bit of money to do it read the manual

586
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,380
Fuel and also

587
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,700
um think about like if you're not going

588
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,159
to host it here in our community we

589
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,740
actually have a number of organizations

590
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,840
that will that are mission aligned

591
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,200
meaning that they will not sell you out

592
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,820
who will host this infrastructure for

593
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,740
you and have like the love to assist you

594
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,360
in spinning it up

595
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,480
um and also like uh we leveraged highly

596
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,460
leveraged I'm teaching people how to you

597
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,159
know like use tail scale with wireguard

598
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,500
as its protocol another open source and

599
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,799
amazing project in order to

600
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,039
um uh gatekeep access to these servers

601
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,900
um that were so distributed across the

602
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,200
globe so even to do things like uh

603
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,360
facilitate RDP

604
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,940
um so in conclusion okay I didn't go so

605
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,080
far over

606
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,360
um I do have nightmares about metadata

607
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,440
because

608
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,740
um there was so much metadata um that

609
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,380
like increased just because we could not

610
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,059
do things in person anymore and we

611
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,520
relied on all of these platforms

612
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,159
um uh in order to facilitate our daily

613
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,140
connections not only interpersonal but

614
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,360
also how we get our job done and you

615
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,919
know like not only is that metadata in

616
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,600
the hands of the platforms but it's also

617
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,580
going to be if not already in the hands

618
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,500
of law enforcement because we've created

619
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,020
such an archive

620
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,880
um I'll bring it back to the US press

621
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,620
Freedom tracker

622
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,260
um where I told you uh we you know

623
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,900
document exactly how members of the

624
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,240
press are affected and one thing that I

625
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,740
did think was interesting that I just

626
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,080
kind of want to stop here on is that

627
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,600
um we do look at you know the number of

628
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,980
subpoenas

629
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,500
um of warrants of uh equipment seizure

630
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,980
of raids and things like that and uh

631
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,140
looking at the period during the

632
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,760
pandemic you know there were actually

633
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,679
very substantial

634
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,380
um uh attempts to uh you know like

635
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,340
Leverage uh all of this against members

636
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,600
of the press when they're dealing with

637
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,580
the most sensitive of sources and this

638
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,380
is why it's important for us to protect

639
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,520
them

640
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,840
all right

641
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,880
um that's my time and thank you very

642
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,000
much
