My name is Eva Galperin,

4
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,363
and I'm a Global Policy Analyst

5
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:09,264
for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:13,693
When a state turns the force of its surveillance apparatus

7
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:17,198
on an individual, like a journalist or an activist,

8
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:21,693
in order to, you know, violate their basic human rights,

9
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:24,627
they have considerably less in the way of resources

10
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:28,131
at their disposal in order to fight this kind of surveillance.

11
00:00:28,132 --> 00:00:31,462
I'm going to talk about what individuals can do,

12
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:33,297
what organizations can do,

13
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:36,726
and what companies and security professionals can do.

14
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:39,000
I think that what's particularly exciting about the work

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,825
that I'm doing is that the stakes are high.

16
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:44,396
Often there's a great emphasis on technical sophistication.

17
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:47,759
One of the other reasons that you should come to Enigma

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,561
is that we're bringing this human rights aspect

19
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:52,033
to the problem.
