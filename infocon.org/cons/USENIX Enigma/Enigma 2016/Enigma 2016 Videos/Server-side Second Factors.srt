00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,858
♪♪

3
00:00:05,264 --> 00:00:07,957
-Thank you. Thank you to the committee

4
00:00:07,957 --> 00:00:09,264
for inviting me to all of you

5
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:12,000
for sticking around through to the last talk.

6
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:16,066
So...

7
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:18,363
my team's job at LinkedIn is to protect our members

8
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:21,726
from fraud and abuse of all types,

9
00:00:21,726 --> 00:00:24,561
and we have a lot of members.

10
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:27,330
We have more than 400 million registered members

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,528
from all over the world...

12
00:00:30,528 --> 00:00:32,000
from more than 200 countries.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,165
We're localized in 24 languages,

14
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,099
and we see a broad diversity

15
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:41,395
of members using LinkedIn for many different purposes --

16
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:44,660
send messages, post résumés, marketing,

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,165
get hired, et cetera.

18
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:50,461
And unfortunately,

19
00:00:50,462 --> 00:00:52,825
the vast majority of these members

20
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:55,462
are not security experts.

21
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:56,726
So, they're probably not going to take

22
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:59,066
the kind of proactive measures

23
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,627
to make themselves and their accounts

24
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:05,726
secure that people in this audience would.

25
00:01:05,726 --> 00:01:07,000
So, one of the things

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,594
that we need to protect them against

27
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:12,363
is their accounts being taken over.

28
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:16,792
And this is unfortunately more common than you would hope

29
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:19,924
because members -- the generic member

30
00:01:19,924 --> 00:01:22,198
is probably not so good at protecting their password

31
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:25,297
and wouldn't do the sorts of things that you would do.

32
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:27,363
So, someone in this audience

33
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:30,726
would never use one of the most common passwords

34
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:34,462
as exposed in various password breaches.

35
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,627
You certainly wouldn't reuse your passwords

36
00:01:36,627 --> 00:01:39,561
across different websites,

37
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,165
and especially a site that got hacked,

38
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:46,000
and therefore, leaving your account open to someone

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,066
that collects those credentials.

40
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,858
You certainly wouldn't get phished

41
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:52,561
or tell your password to somebody

42
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:56,759
who then uses it against you after a falling out.

43
00:01:58,594 --> 00:02:01,098
But, unfortunately,

44
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:05,297
not everybody is as secure as you are.

45
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:07,527
And we want to protect all of our members,

46
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:12,462
not just those who are actively conscious about their security.

47
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,231
So, what are we going to do?

48
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,792
I guess first I've a bit an aside --

49
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:21,462
Why should we be worried about this?

50
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:23,033
What are the attackers looking for

51
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:26,923
when they take over LinkedIn accounts?

52
00:02:26,924 --> 00:02:29,924
And we see...

53
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:32,066
Well, we see spam.

54
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:34,396
And in a social network, if you get spam,

55
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:36,923
it looks more legitimate if it's from somebody you know.

56
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,759
So we see people taking over accounts

57
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,263
and sending messages to their connections,

58
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:48,132
and those connection guards could be down.

59
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,627
There's also valuable data.

60
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:54,297
People have private messages or business data

61
00:02:54,297 --> 00:02:57,000
or personal or even knowing what people's connections

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,363
are would be valuable to an attacker.

63
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:04,561
So, we need to protect our members

64
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:07,033
from these types of threats.

65
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,363
So one thing that we can tell you to do

66
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:10,330
is try to force better passwords.

67
00:03:12,924 --> 00:03:14,693
So, there's various techniques.

68
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,726
We could put password-strength meters in.

69
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:18,231
These have been shown to have some effect

70
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:22,099
at creating higher-entropy passwords.

71
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,857
You could require certain complexity levels

72
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,132
in the passwords,

73
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:30,297
also has been shown to have some effect.

74
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:33,396
But has a downside of making passwords

75
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:34,825
harder to remember,

76
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:38,329
maybe leading to increased reuse across sites.

77
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,033
Password managers, I'm sure most of you use them

78
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:43,594
to manage all of your various Internet accounts.

79
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:47,000
These generate secure, unique passwords

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,396
for every site you visit.

81
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,626
But, of course, this is an opt-in process, right?

82
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:54,198
You have to know that this is a protection

83
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:55,396
you're looking for

84
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:57,791
if you're going to use a password manager.

85
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,297
So, there's a bunch of research

86
00:04:02,297 --> 00:04:04,429
on avoiding passwords altogether.

87
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:06,066
Can we do something else?

88
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,231
If we can't make the passwords themselves

89
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,924
more secure, what can we do?

90
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:12,858
Well, there's obviously two-step verification, right?

91
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:16,000
We log you in. We send a code to your phone.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,197
LinkedIn has a solution.

93
00:04:17,197 --> 00:04:19,132
I hope you are all opted in

94
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,825
to LinkedIn's two-step verification.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,165
But of course, as you might guess,

96
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,297
this being an opt-in process,

97
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:29,363
the adoption rate is low.

98
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:31,165
And again, it's not going to protect

99
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:33,924
the vast majority of our members.

100
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:36,825
There's more theoretical research

101
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,363
on biometric identifiers.

102
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:41,132
This has been shown to actually have some usability properties,

103
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,033
but it's not been deployed at scale

104
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:47,561
and would require changing users' behavior.

105
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,594
There are also a number of sites out there --

106
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,132
This is a trend we've seen --

107
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:53,396
that do away with passwords entirely.

108
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,957
Instead of logging in with a password,

109
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,231
you get a link on your phone or e-mail

110
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,759
that you click to authenticate.

111
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,693
This just pushes the problem down to the e-mail provider

112
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:06,792
or to the mobile provider

113
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:10,561
and doesn't really do anything to solve the core problem.

114
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:15,792
So, when we're thinking about account compromise

115
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,263
on LinkedIn, we really have to assume the worst.

116
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:19,429
We have to assume

117
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:21,494
that the member has chosen a dumb password.

118
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:24,396
It's been leaked across the Internet.

119
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,693
They haven't chosen to opt-in two FA.

120
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,693
The attacker might be a bot

121
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:30,132
that we could use bot detection on,

122
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:33,264
but it might also be a human that can solve

123
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:37,891
any sort of "Are you a human?" challenge.

124
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:39,297
And ultimately the members --

125
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,957
We can't deploy a solution that's going to require

126
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:45,429
members to significantly change their security behavior.

127
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,032
This has proven very difficult.

128
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:56,198
So, what we do, and a number of sites out there do --

129
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:59,000
Elie alluded to Gmail using this --

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,924
is scoring log-in attempts.

131
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:06,032
So, for every log-in attempt you figure out,

132
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,033
is this log-in suspicious?

133
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:12,429
And then above some threshold, you require a second factor

134
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:15,626
or require a challenge to be solved.

135
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:18,132
And you have to make sure also

136
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:20,033
that all your entry points are covered.

137
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:22,363
So, not just log in with username and password

138
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:24,231
but also password reset.

139
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:26,462
So for example, if the e-mail address

140
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:28,659
linked to the account is compromised,

141
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,297
then the link goes out.

142
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:33,528
The attacker initiates a password reset.

143
00:06:33,528 --> 00:06:35,660
The link goes to the compromised e-mail,

144
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,858
and boom, the attacker gets in.

145
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:42,264
So, anywhere that you can get into the site,

146
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:45,264
you need to do this kind of scoring.

147
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:49,165
And the thresholds, again,

148
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:52,528
as we saw in a previous talk, are a business decision,

149
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:54,957
a trade-off between false positives

150
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,264
and false negatives.

151
00:06:56,264 --> 00:06:59,957
So, I'm gonna talk about our experiences

152
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:04,198
with doing this kind of scoring and what we've proposed.

153
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:09,462
So, if we do see something suspicious

154
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,890
and require a second factor, what could we require?

155
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:14,396
So, as I mentioned, you could prove you're a human

156
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:18,561
through entering a text string or the new Google captcha,

157
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:22,429
where you check an "I am not a robot" box.

158
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:25,131
There's a more traditional second factor/path

159
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:28,066
through verifying an SMS

160
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:31,857
or clicking a link in your e-mail address.

161
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:34,099
There's also a well-tested technique

162
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:36,924
of repeating back information that you gave us earlier,

163
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,659
so such as security questions

164
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,495
or the e-mail recovery that we saw in the Gmail talk.

165
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,924
But all of these choices -- the scoring

166
00:07:51,924 --> 00:07:54,659
and the challenges -- come with tradeoffs, right?

167
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,660
One, there's security versus usability tradeoff, right?

168
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,891
If we wanted everything to be perfectly secure,

169
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:04,561
we could require a second factor on every login.

170
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:06,429
But of course, this would be really annoying,

171
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,693
and your users would stop using you

172
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,527
and go to a different website.

173
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:14,594
So, that's not really a choice.

174
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,132
We also need to choose a second factor

175
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:17,429
appropriately for the occasion.

176
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:21,462
If we think it's a bot, we could show a captcha.

177
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:23,957
You know, depending on what we think it is,

178
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:25,296
make the right choice.

179
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,528
And it also needs to be easy to solve for good users

180
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:29,330
and hard for bad guys.

181
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,198
And in our experience, our data has shown

182
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,561
that SMS verification

183
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:38,033
offers this large gap between easy for good guys

184
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:41,297
and hard for bad guys.

185
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:43,198
A number of years ago, we had something called

186
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:44,726
a first name challenge,

187
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:48,033
which was, if we detect a suspicious login,

188
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:50,264
we asked, please enter your first name.

189
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,693
And it turned out

190
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:55,165
that real users were terrible at remembering their first name.

191
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:57,495
[ Laughter ]

192
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:02,066
Either that their accounts were dormant,

193
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,924
and they couldn't remember what they had entered,

194
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:08,693
or they simply didn't understand the question.

195
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:13,132
It was not a long-term solution.

196
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,693
This actually goes back to showing that it's hard

197
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:16,297
to change user's behavior, right?

198
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:17,858
Users know how to solve captchas

199
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,263
'cause they've seen them everywhere.

200
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:22,198
Users know how to enter a PIN from an SMS.

201
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:26,000
And when you say, "Please enter your first name,"

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,231
some people will enter their e-mail address.

203
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:36,462
So, how can we do the login scoring?

204
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, first we have to collect some data.

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,264
So, what data do we have?

206
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:41,858
Well, we have everything that comes in the request.

207
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:44,824
So for example, your IP address from which we can do lookups

208
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:47,726
for your ISP and country, et cetera.

209
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:50,198
We have the reported browser that you're using,

210
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:54,924
time stamp, cookies, and other signals.

211
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:58,429
For each of these elements, we have a reputation score.

212
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,462
So, I'll pick, for example, IP address.

213
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,330
We know globally the history

214
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,297
of that IP address across LinkedIn

215
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:10,198
and all that activity through the 400 million members

216
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:14,000
as well as all the non-logged-in page views that we see.

217
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:18,363
So, we can calculate a reputation score

218
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:23,330
for each IP address and use that in our scoring.

219
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,792
We have counters, right?

220
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,627
We can say, how many logins have there been

221
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:27,824
from this IP address

222
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:32,396
in the past minute, hour, day, whatever?

223
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:35,891
And we also have all the previous data

224
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:38,396
for any given member, right?

225
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:41,396
So, we can look at the member's previous logins

226
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:44,495
and say,

227
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:48,660
"Does this login look like previous logins?"

228
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,924
And this "look like" is something

229
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,329
that I want to dive a little deeper into.

230
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,363
So, we've actually found

231
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:58,957
that heuristics can get you pretty far, right?

232
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,165
Here's a user

233
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:08,033
who usually logs in from San Francisco, and...

234
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:12,891
Well, if she logs in from New York,

235
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:15,000
maybe that's not so bad.

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,264
If she logs in from somewhere in the Indian Ocean,

237
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:20,363
that could be a little bit suspicious.

238
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:23,429
If she logs in from a computer that, you know,

239
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:26,198
that we've tagged as being malicious,

240
00:11:26,198 --> 00:11:27,957
that's also probably not good.

241
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:31,297
Or if there's some computer up in Alaska

242
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:33,924
that's just hammering us with login request

243
00:11:33,924 --> 00:11:35,462
and hits that account,

244
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,693
that's probably also something that we would like to stop.

245
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:44,726
And we found that these are pretty effective

246
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:48,858
against large-scale or indiscriminate attacks.

247
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,924
So, a couple of data points.

248
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:56,297
We observed a fairly large bot attack about a year ago.

249
00:11:56,297 --> 00:12:00,495
And just the single feature of country mismatch

250
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:04,462
was enough to block 99% of an attack.

251
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:07,198
And by "country mismatch," I mean the attempt was coming

252
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:09,429
from a country that had not been seen

253
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,363
in that user's previous login history.

254
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:18,264
We saw another attack a little more recently

255
00:12:18,264 --> 00:12:24,759
where the attackers were a little bit smarter.

256
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,297
98% of them did match a country

257
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:29,165
in the member's previous history,

258
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,198
but they weren't smart about how quickly

259
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:34,297
they went through their IPs,

260
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,165
and we were able to block all of them

261
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:37,924
through rate limiting.

262
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:43,593
But you know, as we've seen, attackers will adapt.

263
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:46,924
And especially if they are targeted attacks,

264
00:12:46,924 --> 00:12:49,957
these heuristics could sometimes fail.

265
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:51,495
So for example, if you're just looking

266
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:54,825
at the country-match heuristic,

267
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:59,099
we found that 93% of our labeled compromised data set

268
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:03,165
actually was matching the country --

269
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:06,396
a country from the member's previous login history.

270
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,824
Whereas of legitimate logins, that number was 96%.

271
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,891
So, almost no difference.

272
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:16,363
So, this is where we want to get a little more fine-grained

273
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:21,297
and look at it from a more statistical point of view.

274
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:25,924
So, ultimately, we're really just trying to decide,

275
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:27,396
which is more likely?

276
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:29,198
Is this an attack,

277
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:32,000
or is this legitimate for a given login?

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,627
And so, if you put it mathematically,

279
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:38,924
is the ratio of these probabilities greater than one?

280
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:41,363
And, actually, you could,

281
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,528
if you want to do a more fine-grained scoring,

282
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:46,000
you could replace that one with some threshold

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,396
and then above or below that threshold,

284
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:48,726
take different actions.

285
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:52,231
Again, this is a business decision based on,

286
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,462
you know, challenging good users versus stopping bad users

287
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,528
or precision versus recall.

288
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:06,858
So, okay, why can't we just, you know, take this formula,

289
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:09,263
compute it from the data, and then be done?

290
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,429
Well, so, if you compute it from the data,

291
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,264
you get a lot of zeroes.

292
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:15,528
And you'll say, oh, then, great.

293
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,561
No one's ever gonna be attacked.

294
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:19,660
But we want to get

295
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,957
some non-zero probability estimate

296
00:14:21,957 --> 00:14:25,495
that any given login is an attack.

297
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:29,858
So, one problem is that we don't have any data on most members.

298
00:14:29,858 --> 00:14:31,824
The vast majority of members are never attacked,

299
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:35,264
so we get zero in the numerator.

300
00:14:35,264 --> 00:14:37,297
There's only a few samples. Right?

301
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:39,495
We have very sparse data,

302
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:43,165
and what do we do if there's some, say, IP address

303
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,791
that we've never even seen before?

304
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,330
Then you get zero in the numerator and the denominator,

305
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,693
and you have no idea what to put as your estimate.

306
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,891
So...

307
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,924
...we can massage this formula a little bit

308
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:02,957
and come up with the formula on the right-hand side,

309
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:04,957
which is composed of five terms.

310
00:15:04,957 --> 00:15:06,792
I want to go through each of these

311
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,825
and try to convince you

312
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,924
that these are actually intuitive measures

313
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:16,462
of what we might look for in a suspicious login.

314
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:20,792
So, the probability of an attack given the data.

315
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:23,726
So, X is the login data.

316
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:25,000
If you want to be really concrete,

317
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,561
think of X as the IP address.

318
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:30,000
So I'll just hold that example in mind

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,825
as I go through this.

320
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:34,264
So, the probability of an attack given IP address

321
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:38,561
is rolled up as to our asset reputation system.

322
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,891
And we can look at not just account-takeover attacks,

323
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,957
but also any kind of bad activity on the site

324
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:48,429
such as fake accounts or spam or other kinds of fraud.

325
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:52,891
And we have a system that tries to estimate this reputation,

326
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:55,165
and we can normalize it into a probability.

327
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:00,824
We have the global likelihood

328
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:05,033
of seeing the particular IP address, say,

329
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:07,495
and these are --

330
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:11,627
This can be computed from previous history,

331
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,165
and serves as sort of a prior

332
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:19,495
on how likely an IP address is to be logged in from, say.

333
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:23,561
Here's the member's data.

334
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:27,033
So this is the appearance of, say, the IP address

335
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,660
in that particular member's history.

336
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,759
It's in the denominator, right?

337
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,561
So if that probability is higher,

338
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:37,594
if they've often logged in from that IP,

339
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:42,528
then it's more likely that that login is legitimate.

340
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,660
There's also the value of an account

341
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,132
to the attacker, right?

342
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,000
We have several internal metrics

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,099
that measure the value of an account

344
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:54,858
using things like number of connections,

345
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:59,363
level of activity on the site, and this makes sense.

346
00:16:59,363 --> 00:17:04,000
A more valuable account is more likely to be attacked.

347
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,825
And then, also, there's just the baseline likelihood

348
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,132
of that member logging in.

349
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:10,759
If you see somebody logging in,

350
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,231
you know, regularly or every day,

351
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:18,263
then that member logging in again is less suspicious

352
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,593
than if somebody was dormant for a long time

353
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:22,792
and then logs in.

354
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:31,231
So, putting all these together, you can actually see that...

355
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:33,264
You know that there's actually

356
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:36,197
no per-member attack data required

357
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:38,858
to compute this formula.

358
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:43,396
Especially if you, you know, have a reputation system

359
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,066
or perhaps you could even get a reputation system

360
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,363
from a third party,

361
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:51,231
a number of vendors who maintain these sorts of things.

362
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:53,594
This is good if you're trying to boost drop a system,

363
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:56,561
or if you don't have good labeled data.

364
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,264
If you do have labeled data,

365
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:01,924
then you can get a little bit smarter,

366
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:03,594
and you can weight these features.

367
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:06,198
I put these in as exponents.

368
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,297
But if you take a logarithm, then this is a linear model

369
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:09,924
that you can learn with logistic regression

370
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:12,825
or any other classifier.

371
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:17,825
There's one question I haven't addressed,

372
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:20,627
which is, how do we estimate a probability of something

373
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:22,066
that we've never seen before?

374
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,495
So, for example,

375
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:26,197
a member comes in from a totally new IP address.

376
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:28,066
So, we addressed this with something we called smoothing,

377
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,297
which is a technique borrowed

378
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:31,891
from natural-language processing.

379
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,462
And the idea is, we arrange our features.

380
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:35,759
So for example, IP address.

381
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,396
We arrange them in hierarchies.

382
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:40,858
So, you have the IP address, which might belong to an ISP,

383
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:44,131
which is part of a country, which is part of the world.

384
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,824
And the idea is that,

385
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,231
if you haven't seen a given IP address

386
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:54,132
but you have seen the member login from that ISP,

387
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:58,627
that's going to be more legitimate, less suspicious

388
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:01,000
than if all the data is fresh.

389
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,528
Like, they go to a totally new country, right?

390
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:05,033
So, this is making statistical

391
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:07,362
that heuristic of country mismatch.

392
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,231
Okay, so we built the prototype and ran some experiments.

393
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:18,033
Note that these experiments only used two features.

394
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:23,264
So, in practice, we use many more.

395
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:28,593
And we found that the model

396
00:19:28,594 --> 00:19:30,693
gave us a little bit of a degradation

397
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:32,561
in the botnet coverage

398
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:36,792
but greatly boosted the compromised account coverage.

399
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:40,000
And then we combine the model and the heuristics,

400
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,132
we got, you know,

401
00:19:42,132 --> 00:19:45,858
more than 10 times boost for the compromised accounts

402
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:48,428
without degrading the botnet coverage

403
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,594
and also a lower false-positive rate

404
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:53,594
than this simple baseline statistic.

405
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,363
So, there's full details of this model

406
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:06,561
and more detailed experiments are in our upcoming paper --

407
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:09,131
at NDSS.

408
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:12,726
So, I want to conclude just with a few takeaways.

409
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:16,495
So, first of all, protect all your users or members,

410
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:21,197
not just the ones who are consciously aware of, you know,

411
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:22,858
protecting their security

412
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:26,066
or maintain the security of protecting themselves.

413
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,330
Minimize friction.

414
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,033
There's a security and friction tradeoff,

415
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,759
so take steps

416
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,693
to only put friction in front of activity

417
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,462
that you deem to be suspicious.

418
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:42,363
Heuristics and machine learning work well together.

419
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:43,891
Heuristics give you a good baseline,

420
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:46,924
and the machine learning can plug the gaps.

421
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:50,099
And finally, if you don't have good labeled data,

422
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,000
you can still use statistical modeling techniques

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,693
to come up with a system.

424
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:57,660
Thank you.
