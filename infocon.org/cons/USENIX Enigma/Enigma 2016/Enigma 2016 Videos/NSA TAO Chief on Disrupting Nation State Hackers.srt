1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:05,462


2
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:06,396
[ Applause ]

3
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:07,429
JOYCE: Appreciate it.

4
00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:08,495
Thanks -- thanks
for the welcome.

5
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:10,890
So -- so, as David introduced,

6
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:12,693
I'm from Tailored
Access Operations.

7
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:15,231
And I will admit,
it is very strange, right,

8
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:16,726
to be in that position,

9
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:19,726
appear on a stage in front
of a group of people.

10
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:21,000
It's not something often done.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,858
Um, but --
but I'm, uh, I'm in a --

12
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,660
a unique position
in that we produce, in TAO,

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,957
foreign intelligence
for a wide range of missions

14
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:34,957
to include advice

15
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:38,231
to informing policy makers, um,

16
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:42,132
protecting
the nation's war fighters 24/7.

17
00:00:42,132 --> 00:00:43,957
And in that space, um,

18
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:45,957
we're doing
nation-state exploitation.

19
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:49,825
And so my talk today
is to tell you,

20
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:52,429
as a nation-state exploiter,

21
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:55,033
what can you do
to defend yourself

22
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,858
to make my life hard, right?

23
00:00:56,858 --> 00:00:59,297
So not many people
will stand on the stage

24
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:01,693
and have the perspective
of an organization

25
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,396
that does exploitation

26
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,297
and to be able to talk
to those elements

27
00:01:06,297 --> 00:01:10,594
that really would disrupt
the nation-state hackers.

28
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:14,264
Um, so in that vein, um,

29
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:16,131
I want you to think about
if there's something

30
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:17,957
you really, really
want to protect,

31
00:01:17,957 --> 00:01:19,330
what do you have to do?

32
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,495
So you'll hear a common theme
throughout my talk.

33
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:24,264
It'll boil down
to a couple small things.

34
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:26,066
The theme
I want you to take away

35
00:01:26,066 --> 00:01:29,495
is if you really want
to protect your network,

36
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:31,264
you really have to know
your network.

37
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:34,000
You have to know the devices,
the security, technologies

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,924
and the things inside it.

39
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:37,891
So why are we successful?

40
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,627
We put the time in
to know that network.

41
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:43,396
We put the time in
to know it better

42
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:45,066
than the people who designed it

43
00:01:45,066 --> 00:01:47,099
and the people
who are securing it.

44
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,495
And that's the bottom line.

45
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:51,231
And you'll kind of hear
that woven throughout the talk.

46
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:58,561
So if you think about
what goes into an intrusion,

47
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:02,495
there's a series of phases
that happen, right?

48
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:05,594
As you walk down
through these, um,

49
00:02:05,594 --> 00:02:08,098
I'll talk about the things
that can...

50
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,660
that -- that we focus on.

51
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,792
Um, and you could break
the chain throughout that, uh,

52
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:16,330
throughout that compromise

53
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,429
by disrupting the transitions
between these elements.

54
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:24,033
So really the first phase

55
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:28,396
during a targeted intrusion
is a reconnaissance phase.

56
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:31,428
Somebody's got to go out
and understand the target.

57
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:34,198
It starts with
simple things like scanning.

58
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:37,528
Go out and physically
scan the actual target.

59
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:41,329
There's understanding
important people

60
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,000
or e-mail addresses
from that activity.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Going out and looking
at the open-source information

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,462
about that target.

63
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:51,000
So it really is,
what can you learn?

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,957
What can you understand?

65
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:55,363
As I said earlier,
our key to success

66
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:57,594
is knowing that network
better than the people

67
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,924
who set it up.

68
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:01,033
So in that space,
the reconnaissance phase

69
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,297
is really important.

70
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:05,099
I'm gonna move my laptop
a little here

71
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,660
so I can get to my notes.

72
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:17,132
So another key point
inside this, um,

73
00:03:17,132 --> 00:03:18,528
you know the technologies

74
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:21,594
you intended to use
in that network.

75
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:23,066
We know the technologies

76
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:25,957
that are actually
in use in that network.

77
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,231
Subtle difference.
Did you catch that?

78
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:29,660
You know what you
intended to use.

79
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,792
We know what's actually
in use inside there.

80
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,693
So when we look at that,

81
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,759
we will learn
the security functionality

82
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:41,000
of the devices
inside that network.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,132
We'll study them,
understand them,

84
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:44,924
find the vulnerabilities.

85
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,660
In fact, we've got people

86
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,627
who will know
the security functionalities

87
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:51,462
of those devices
better than the people

88
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:53,923
who developed
the actual device, right?

89
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:55,858
So they won't know
the whole product.

90
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:59,330
They won't know every feature
that those developers had.

91
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,330
But they'll understand
the security technologies,

92
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,561
and they'll bring that expertise
at a very, very deep level.

93
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,891
So inside that, um,

94
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:13,792
it's minute attention to detail
inside that security layer,

95
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,726
again, knowing the network,
knowing that space.

96
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:18,132
So what does that mean?

97
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,825
We apply the focus and energy
to look at those details.

98
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:23,164
Um, will you,

99
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:25,330
as people who have
important things

100
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,693
to protect and hold dear,

101
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:31,000
will you put in the energy
to understand the network,

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,363
understand the devices
and configure

103
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:37,330
and use them in the proper way
that would prevent exploitation?

104
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,726
So there's a foundational piece
of advice

105
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,924
to countering these kind
of threats, right?

106
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:50,330
You've got to have procedures
to evaluate what you'll use,

107
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,957
what you'll install.

108
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:55,495
You've got to lock down and, uh,

109
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,627
disable those things
that you're, uh,

110
00:04:57,627 --> 00:04:59,297
that you're not using, right?

111
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:01,264
Reduce the attack surface.

112
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:04,033
Um, it's not a new

113
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,891
or amazingly insightful piece
of advice.

114
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,891
Um, but you'd be surprised,

115
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,231
as I said, about the things

116
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:11,726
that are running on a network

117
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:14,462
versus the things that you think
are supposed to be there.

118
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:17,462
So what can you do to understand
that exposure surface?

119
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:20,693
Red team that network.
Bring in pen testers.

120
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,527
Poke and prod it,
just like an adversary will do,

121
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:26,033
to find out
what's inside that space.

122
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:29,165
Um, find out what's exploitable.

123
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:34,395
Well-run networks really
do make our job hard.

124
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:36,561
So if you go to the trouble

125
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:39,066
of understanding
what's inside a network,

126
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,726
you run that pen test,

127
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:44,099
you've got those results,
act on it.

128
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,033
So NSA, in our information
assurance side,

129
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,132
will do red team
testing against,

130
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,231
uh, against government networks.

131
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,693
So we'll, inevitably,

132
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:56,231
find things
that are misconfigured,

133
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,528
things that shouldn't be set up

134
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:00,231
inside that network,
holes and flaws,

135
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,231
and we'll produce reports
telling the network owner things

136
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,792
they need to fix.

137
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:08,032
Cycle comes around to the point
where we've got to get back

138
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:11,891
and redo a red team
against that same network.

139
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,165
It is not uncommon

140
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,561
for us to find
the same security flaws

141
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,330
that were
in that original report.

142
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,363
That's the first place we go
is to the original report.

143
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:23,330
Did the things we pointed out
previously get fixed?

144
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,495
So, um, inexcusable,
inconceivable,

145
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:30,594
but returning
a couple years later,

146
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,891
the same holes
and vulnerabilities exist.

147
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,891
I've seen it
in the corporate sector, too.

148
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:36,957
I've seen it
in our targets, right?

149
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:39,759
People tell you
you're vulnerable in a space,

150
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,660
close it down and lock it down.

151
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:47,231
So if you've invested
the resources

152
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:51,924
to do that kind of discovery
and red team space, um,

153
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,825
go ahead and follow through.

154
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:59,198
Another key point,
don't assume a crack

155
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:02,495
is too small to be noticed
or too small to be exploited.

156
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:04,627
So if you go through
and do that pen test,

157
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:08,693
and you say, "We look great
on these 97 things,

158
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:10,659
but these three things
over here,

159
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,429
they're kind of esoteric.

160
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:14,527
They probably don't matter much.

161
00:07:14,528 --> 00:07:17,132
We'll probably
ignore them," right?

162
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,660
That's what we need.
We need that toe hold.

163
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,264
We need that first crack,
that first seam, um,

164
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:24,924
and we're gonna look
and look and look

165
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:28,132
for that esoteric kind
of edge case

166
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:30,594
to break open and crack in.

167
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:32,792
So pay attention
to those results.

168
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,231
Same thing in this discussion

169
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:38,957
about --
about the, uh, the --

170
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:42,659
the temporary security
vulnerabilities.

171
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,528
So if you own a network,

172
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:46,858
and you got trouble
with an appliance

173
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,726
inside your trust zone,

174
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:52,561
inside your network boundary,

175
00:07:52,561 --> 00:07:53,792
and you're talking to the vendor

176
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:57,429
and just can't quite
make it work.

177
00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:00,099
And they say, "Well,
open it up for me.

178
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,693
I'll come in.
We'll poke around.

179
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:04,792
We'll take some logs.
We'll fix it for you.

180
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,198
We'll do it over the weekend.
Don't worry," right?

181
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:12,032
Are you gonna open that door
for that 24, 36 hours?

182
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,924
So I'll tell you,
the nation-state attackers,

183
00:08:14,924 --> 00:08:18,429
there's a reason it's called
advanced persistent threats

184
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,395
because we'll poke
and we'll poke.

185
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:21,825
And we'll wait and we'll wait

186
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,132
and we'll wait, right?

187
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:25,198
We're looking
for that opportunity,

188
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:26,561
that opening,

189
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:29,890
and that opportunity to --
to -- to finish the mission.

190
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:40,131
Another big area, I'd say,
in this reconnaissance phase

191
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:45,396
is figuring out
about the network boundaries.

192
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:52,593
So I talked earlier
about you know the things

193
00:08:52,594 --> 00:08:55,264
you intend to have
in your network.

194
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:58,000
We look for the things that
are actually in your network.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,627
Well, that's becoming
harder and harder these days

196
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,891
as the network boundary
gets more amorphous,

197
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:05,462
gets more porous

198
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,495
or gets more inclusive
of other things.

199
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:13,297
Um, think about trends
like bring your own devices, um,

200
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:17,363
Internet of things,
work from home access.

201
00:09:17,363 --> 00:09:21,726
Um, these have really
created situations

202
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:25,660
where Internet --
interconnected network elements

203
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,296
are under varying administration
control, right?

204
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:30,726
I even see the case

205
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:34,660
where leased facilities
come with a leased network

206
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,132
that is under the control
of that --

207
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,263
that physical location

208
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:41,891
and trusted in Internet...

209
00:09:41,891 --> 00:09:44,264
interconnected
to your domain, right?

210
00:09:44,264 --> 00:09:46,132
So think about the things

211
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:49,098
that are now a component
of your domain,

212
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,825
your trust zone.

213
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,297
Cloud computing, right?

214
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:54,693
Cloud computing

215
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:58,627
is really a fancy name
for somebody else's computer.

216
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:01,198
If you have your data
in the cloud, right,

217
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:03,660
you're trusting
the security protocols,

218
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,165
the physical security,

219
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:10,198
all of the other elements
of trust in an outside entity,

220
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:11,891
maybe done right.
It may not.

221
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:14,693
You may have varying degrees
of understanding

222
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:16,495
about what's inside that cloud.

223
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:19,891
But they are now part
of your risk and liability.

224
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:29,693
So I see a growing trend
that are really making it hard

225
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:31,759
and diffusing
the network boundary.

226
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,033
Um, trust boundaries now
extended to partners, um,

227
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,231
personal devices, right?

228
00:10:38,231 --> 00:10:41,132
All of us love to have
our iPhones, Androids,

229
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:44,693
tablets,
devices come and go, right?

230
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:48,000
You're trusting
those onto the network.

231
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,264
Um, there's even the heating
and cooling systems, right?

232
00:10:52,264 --> 00:10:55,198
Other elements of building
infrastructure and more.

233
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:59,231
So what are you doing to really
shore up the trust boundary

234
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,462
around the things
you absolutely must defend?

235
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:03,593
And that, for me,
is what it comes down to.

236
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:06,462
Do you really know what the keys
to the kingdom are

237
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:08,957
that you must defend, right?

238
00:11:08,957 --> 00:11:10,924
Instrument, defend,

239
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:13,462
pay attention
to those crown jewels, um,

240
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:17,528
because that attention and rigor
really makes our job hard.

241
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:21,759
So after reconnaissance,

242
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,792
the next phase is getting
that initial exploitation.

243
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:28,033
Got to find a way to get
energy inside that network.

244
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:31,561
Can you go ahead
and get some opportunity?

245
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:35,264
Um, these things
can happen from spear fishing.

246
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:37,099
They can happen
from water holing.

247
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,495
Is there a, uh,
weakly defended site

248
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,528
that everybody goes to?

249
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:45,792
Um, exploiting
a known CVE, right,

250
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,396
there's already a vulnerability,

251
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:50,824
and there's a recipe
for exploiting that --

252
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:54,429
that activity already done.

253
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:59,264
SQL injection, um,

254
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:01,594
exploiting a zero day,

255
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:04,891
other technologies,
ways to get in.

256
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,560
I think a lot
of people think, you know,

257
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:08,396
the nation-states,

258
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:10,858
they're running
on this engine of zero days.

259
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,858
You go out
with your master skeleton key

260
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,660
and unlock the door,
and you're in.

261
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,924
It's not that.

262
00:12:16,924 --> 00:12:20,264
Take these big corporate
networks, these large networks,

263
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,396
any large network,
I will tell you

264
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:25,693
that persistence and focus
will get you in,

265
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:28,000
um, will achieve
that exploitation

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,264
without the zero days.

267
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:33,264
There -- there's
so many more vectors

268
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,429
that are easier, less risky,

269
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,957
and -- and, quite often,
more productive, um,

270
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:41,396
than going down that route.

271
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:45,726
So to ward off a persistent,
um, vector,

272
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:48,792
you really need to invest
in continuous defensive work,

273
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:51,561
right, because if the CVE world

274
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,759
is continuously rolling
and pumping out new information

275
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:57,594
about cracks and holes
in existing products

276
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,066
and services,

277
00:12:59,066 --> 00:13:01,132
you've got
to be continually updating

278
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:03,495
and defending inside that space.

279
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:08,066
So most --
most intrusions come down

280
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:10,957
to one of three
initial vectors, right?

281
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,858
E-mail, where a user
opened an e-mail,

282
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:17,758
clicked on something
that they shouldn't have.

283
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,396
Um, a website,

284
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:22,098
where they've gotten
to a malicious website

285
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,693
and they've gone ahead,
and it's either executed,

286
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:27,858
or they've -- they've run
content from that website.

287
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,527
Or removable media,

288
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:32,561
where a user inserted
contaminated media, um,

289
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,660
sometimes even bridging
an air gap network, right?

290
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,363
But those three
are the big three.

291
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:42,594
Where do you need
to go in this space?

292
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:44,759
You really need to get
the networks

293
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,627
not to rely on the users

294
00:13:46,627 --> 00:13:49,198
to automatically make
the right decisions.

295
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,561
Um, sometimes
even the experts get it wrong.

296
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:54,924
So how can we build and ensure

297
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:58,198
the policies
and the technical enforcement

298
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,066
of those written policies
keep, uh, accidents

299
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,660
and slip ups
from occurring, right,

300
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,924
because I don't care
how many times you train people

301
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:10,560
about not clicking
on those unsolicited e-mails,

302
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,495
um, people do.

303
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,660
And even when you get
to the nation-state

304
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,098
advanced persistent level, um,

305
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:20,462
sometimes those e-mails can be
really well crafted to the point

306
00:14:20,462 --> 00:14:23,693
where it's not an unreasonable
thing for somebody to click on.

307
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:27,198
So how do you prevent that
from detonating?

308
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,792
Can your architecture
and your policies

309
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:32,858
defend against
those user actions

310
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:34,527
that are gonna take place?

311
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:36,165
Can they stop
those threat vectors

312
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:39,198
because if they can,
it really makes my job hard.

313
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:41,528
So one thing
I'd absolutely recommend,

314
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:45,462
um, is things
like anti-exploitation features,

315
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:46,957
Microsoft EMET.

316
00:14:46,957 --> 00:14:49,396
Everybody ought to be turning
that on, right?

317
00:14:49,396 --> 00:14:52,396
It really does slow down,

318
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:54,693
um, the -- the --
the amount of vectors

319
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:58,132
that are available for something
to execute in that space.

320
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:02,032
So I'd look at NSA's information
assurance directorates.

321
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,792
They have
a host mitigation package.

322
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:07,495
So it's best practices
for locking down

323
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:09,297
and mitigating
at the host level.

324
00:15:09,297 --> 00:15:11,957
Um, EMET is only one
of those recommendations.

325
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,165
There's a whole series
of things, um,

326
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:16,957
that really do
lock things down well.

327
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,957
That's the guide.
Those are the specificity.

328
00:15:19,957 --> 00:15:21,462
There's not the secret sauce

329
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,132
that goes beyond that
inside the protection

330
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,396
of classified material
for the U.S. government, right?

331
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:30,329
Look at that guide.
It really, really is solid.

332
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,462
Um, the other thing
you've got to do,

333
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:37,957
you've got to take care of --

334
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:41,033
take advantage
of software improvement, right?

335
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:45,000
I -- I mentioned
CVEs and vulnerabilities.

336
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,957
Boy, if there's a known bug

337
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:49,957
in a software
that's exploitable, um,

338
00:15:49,957 --> 00:15:52,759
you ought to be fixing that
and getting it off your network.

339
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,792
So I think, uh, um, you know,

340
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:58,825
tip of the hat
to the software industry

341
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:02,924
that is making upgrades
and automatic patching

342
00:16:02,924 --> 00:16:04,462
a background activity

343
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:07,033
that's beyond the user control.
Right?

344
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,726
That is
an outstanding security practice

345
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:11,528
where it is just taking care of,

346
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:14,561
every time
there is a new, um,

347
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:16,924
there is a newly closed
vulnerability,

348
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:19,132
it becomes part
of your ecosystem.

349
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:20,363
That's an outstanding thing.

350
00:16:20,363 --> 00:16:22,957
And that cuts down
the opportunity window

351
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:26,066
between known vulnerability
and execution.

352
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:29,627
And if that patch window
is months or years...um,

353
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:32,165
again, an inexcusable practice.

354
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:41,098
So the other thing I'd encourage
is use a secure host baseline.

355
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:45,099
So, again, that kind of goes
like the host mitigation plan,

356
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:47,363
um, the -- the IED product.

357
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:53,693
Um, secure host baseline
is the current best practices

358
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,824
for locking down configurations.

359
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:57,693
Um, again, there's some out

360
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:01,363
on the NSA Information
Assurance website to look at.

361
00:17:01,363 --> 00:17:04,429
So I'll tell you,

362
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,165
our organization teaches
and trains.

363
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:09,594
That's one thing we do really,
really well, right?

364
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,396
We institutionalize
that knowledge.

365
00:17:11,396 --> 00:17:14,165
We teach people to get them
to the next level

366
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,494
so that they can work
and exploit.

367
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,428
So we train best practices.

368
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:21,297
We pass those on.
We use those best practices.

369
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:25,000
So I'm gonna use best practices
for exploitation.

370
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,494
Are you gonna
use best practices for defense?

371
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,924
Again, it -- it really
comes down to that.

372
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,264
If you have
something somebody's coming at

373
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:36,165
and you need to defend it,

374
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:39,132
you need to be looking at
what is that apex predator

375
00:17:39,132 --> 00:17:41,726
gonna be doing to come
after your information?

376
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:44,264
Um, they're gonna be using
the best practices for offense.

377
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,099
You've got to be using
best practices for defense.

378
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:54,924
In almost any intrusion

379
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,429
at this initial
exploitation space,

380
00:17:57,429 --> 00:17:59,297
people are trying
to get credentials, right?

381
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:02,363
Often legitimate credentials
are compromised,

382
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:05,297
enabling intruders to get in
and masquerade

383
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:07,561
as legitimate users, um,

384
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,890
coming after the network.

385
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:13,792
And -- and it's imperative

386
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,000
that you have some processes
and plans

387
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,099
to understand what normal
is inside your network.

388
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:23,099
So if somebody's
got credentials,

389
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:25,033
are they operating
under the norms

390
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,362
for those credentials?

391
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:28,297
Are they going to the places
that they should be?

392
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:30,231
Are they trying things, um,

393
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:32,132
that they shouldn't
be doing, right?

394
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:37,132
Better-defended networks, um,
require specific methods

395
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:40,132
for accessing
the resources of that network.

396
00:18:40,132 --> 00:18:43,231
They --
they monitor credential uses.

397
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:45,957
They look
for anomalous behaviors.

398
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:49,132
Um, two-factor authentication,

399
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:51,660
right, making it
that much harder, uh,

400
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,924
to, uh, steal credentials.

401
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,197
And -- and it --

402
00:18:57,198 --> 00:19:00,297
it really is important
to make sure

403
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:02,957
that that small crack
of a lost credential

404
00:19:02,957 --> 00:19:04,891
doesn't get turned into a pivot

405
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:08,198
in a later stage
into a large access.

406
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:12,066
Um, there's been
numerous security best practices

407
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:14,396
that have been recommended
over the years.

408
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:19,264
Um, but some of the things
like making sure

409
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:21,924
lease privileges
for accounts, right?

410
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:24,429
There are only
a very small handful

411
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,627
of accounts that have
the keys to the kingdom.

412
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:29,428
And you only give
the privileges needed, um,

413
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:31,165
to specific users.

414
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:34,066
Um, not everybody's happy living
in that world, right?

415
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:37,396
Why can't I have admin
to my server or my boxes,

416
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:38,726
those kind of pieces?

417
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:41,429
Those are the kind of
wide-ranging credential reuses

418
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,792
that wind up turning in
to large-scale compromises.

419
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,890
Um, segmenting off
portions of the networks

420
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:52,000
rarely implemented,
whitelisting, things like that.

421
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,066
If you care about your things,
consider those, right?

422
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:56,462
They really
do make your hard --

423
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,132
Make our life hard.

424
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:04,396
We also really love it
when administrator credentials

425
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,956
or other system-wide credentials

426
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:08,066
are hard coded into scripts

427
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:10,396
or accessible on the devices.

428
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:12,165
You know, so I think
people are starting

429
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:15,231
to understand the pass
the hash vulnerability, right?

430
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,726
If you haven't
learned about that,

431
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,528
if you don't know what pass
the hash is, go --

432
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:19,792
go understand it.

433
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:21,495
So that's something
where you can get,

434
00:20:21,495 --> 00:20:24,693
you know, uh,
a domain credential.

435
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:27,660
And you --
you can grab a credential

436
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,693
and move laterally
onto other machines

437
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:34,693
and just pivot like mad
throughout the network.

438
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:38,825
So one of the --
the key activities

439
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,825
is really thinking about, um,

440
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,627
how you manage
those capabilities

441
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:47,165
so that you can
protect against, uh,

442
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:48,891
against pass the hash.

443
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,956
I mentioned that if things
are hard coded

444
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,858
and included in scripts,

445
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,792
you know, they're vulnerable
and -- and likely,

446
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,462
um, to be pulled.

447
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:06,825
Most of the --

448
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:08,759
most of the modern protocols
these days

449
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:11,825
are not passing credentials
in the clear.

450
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:14,231
But do you think nation-states
are taking advantage

451
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,759
of the ones that are, right?

452
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,462
So you got to look
for those older protocols,

453
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:19,132
drive 'em out of your networks.

454
00:21:19,132 --> 00:21:20,528
Um, it -- it --

455
00:21:20,528 --> 00:21:23,429
it's not enough to know
about things like pass the hash

456
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,462
and making sure
that all of the authentications

457
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:28,825
are done only
with more modern protocols

458
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:31,132
that keep the passcodes

459
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:34,330
and passwords out of, uh,
out of plaintext.

460
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,890
Um, but think about
where you've hard coded and --

461
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:39,924
and enabled one box to log in

462
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,231
through an account
to another to do an activity.

463
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:44,594
Um, it really
does make yourself vulnerable.

464
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:51,759
The other big thing
I'd recommend,

465
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,495
enable those logs
but also look at the logs.

466
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:58,659
You'd be amazed
at incident response teams go in

467
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,132
and, you know, there's been
some tremendous breach.

468
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:04,660
Yep, there it is
right there in the logs.

469
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,033
Great.
You've got logs.

470
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,396
It'll tell you
that you've been had.

471
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:11,858
Um, enable those logs.
Look at those logs.

472
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:13,726
I'll tell you,
one of our worst nightmares

473
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,825
is that out of band network tap

474
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:19,462
that really is capturing
all the data,

475
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:22,264
understanding
anomalous behavior going on.

476
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:24,693
And somebody's
paying attention to it.

477
00:22:24,693 --> 00:22:27,330
So rewind all the way
back to the beginning of my talk

478
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,165
where I said you've got
to know your network,

479
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:31,825
understand your network

480
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,066
because we're going to, right?

481
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:37,561
Those logs, they are
just the rock bottom

482
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:40,131
bedrock foundation
of understanding

483
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:41,429
if you've got a problem

484
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:42,891
or if you've got
somebody rattling

485
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:44,924
the doorknobs
to give you a problem.

486
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:50,330
All right? So somebody's cracked
open the door.

487
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,561
They're --
they're on the threshold.

488
00:22:52,561 --> 00:22:54,033
Um, the next thing
they've got to do

489
00:22:54,033 --> 00:22:55,890
is they want
to establish persistence.

490
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:59,165
It's not good enough
just to be in a network.

491
00:22:59,165 --> 00:23:01,231
But if -- if
you're really there to exploit,

492
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,825
you want to dig in, um,
and hold, right?

493
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:06,462
So work happens at this point.

494
00:23:06,462 --> 00:23:07,924
Privilege escalate, maybe,

495
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:10,033
so that you can get down
some tools,

496
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:13,264
um, finding run keys, um,

497
00:23:13,264 --> 00:23:15,462
getting into scripts,

498
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:19,462
other technologies to ensure
that persistence, um,

499
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:23,000
onto those computers
so that you can stay.

500
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,429
One of the things
we run into here, um,

501
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:27,165
things that have, uh,

502
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:29,594
implemented
application whitelisting

503
00:23:29,594 --> 00:23:30,957
makes this world hard.

504
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:34,561
Um, application whitelisting,
it is difficult

505
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:37,396
for generic users
in a large network

506
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:39,693
to know exactly
what applications

507
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:41,495
you're gonna run,
what should be permitted.

508
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:43,495
There's some good work going on,

509
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:45,296
um, to make this a little
more generic

510
00:23:45,297 --> 00:23:46,759
and understand what's --

511
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,396
what's routine and what's not
inside an organization.

512
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:51,528
But, again, as I said, you know,

513
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:54,627
figure out early
what you need to protect,

514
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:56,099
segment that off.

515
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:57,330
And that's the place you maybe

516
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,858
want to think
about whitelisting, right?

517
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:03,297
Make sure that in that space
they can't run a piece of mail

518
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:05,528
where something new or unusual.

519
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,297
Um, your goal needs to be to --

520
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:11,198
to restrain
that malicious behavior, um,

521
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:15,264
keep it from launching
in the interim.

522
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:19,593
So then after you've gotten
into the network,

523
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:21,792
um, install some tools, right?

524
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:24,528
Usually, the first tools
down are lightweight,

525
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:26,165
small beaconing things.

526
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,528
Their intent is
to establish that beachhead

527
00:24:28,528 --> 00:24:29,924
and then bring down the tools

528
00:24:29,924 --> 00:24:32,956
that are actually
gonna do the work.

529
00:24:32,957 --> 00:24:37,231
Um, so --
so there are things, I think,

530
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:39,099
the AV industry, at times,

531
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,825
gets a bad rap
for their ability

532
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:44,000
or inability to keep things off.

533
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,495
You know, if your AV
is a list of bad things

534
00:24:46,495 --> 00:24:48,956
that shouldn't run
on your computer, um,

535
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:51,231
that's not a great technique

536
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:53,561
because that just means
the unique thing

537
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,858
you need to run on that computer
needs to be unique,

538
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:57,924
and it will never be
in that list.

539
00:24:57,924 --> 00:25:00,956
Um, but the research
and the technology's evolving

540
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,561
now where, um,

541
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:05,462
reputation services are more
the -- more the norm.

542
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,429
So every piece of, uh, software

543
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:09,264
that wants to execute
on your machine

544
00:25:09,264 --> 00:25:11,858
gets hashed, pushed up
into the cloud.

545
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:15,659
Um, let me tell you, if
you've got a reputation service,

546
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,561
and it says that
interesting executable

547
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,362
that you think you want to run

548
00:25:20,363 --> 00:25:22,825
in the entire history
of the Internet

549
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,825
has been run one time,

550
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,330
and it's on your machine,

551
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,824
be afraid, right,
be very afraid.

552
00:25:29,825 --> 00:25:32,660
So reputation services
are -- are --

553
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,759
are a growing technology, um,

554
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,231
that can make our life hard.

555
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:38,396
Similarly, most of these tools

556
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:40,561
want to talk out
to a domain

557
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:43,462
to get those, um,
those further modules.

558
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:45,462
Um, they want to talk out, um,

559
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,462
and, uh, and call back home.

560
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,066
They want to report
success or bring data back.

561
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:53,693
So -- so they'll be wearing
a domain name, right?

562
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:56,198
Reputation services work
probably

563
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:59,396
even better in
the domain name world, um,

564
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:04,132
because the domain names, um,

565
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:07,099
if -- it's not enough
to block bad

566
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,956
known bad domains, right?
That's important.

567
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:11,396
But usually that'll
get you the crime

568
00:26:11,396 --> 00:26:13,428
where you've got
to block the things

569
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:14,924
that are not known good.

570
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:17,462
It's really hard
for an exploiter

571
00:26:17,462 --> 00:26:19,495
to get a website

572
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:22,396
created and established
that has good reputation.

573
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:24,924
It's not hard to --
to register a domain

574
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:26,561
and make something
call out to it.

575
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:30,197
But -- but if something
is evaluating that reputation,

576
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:31,759
and nobody else is going to it,

577
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,693
or the content's stale,
it's not updated,

578
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,462
um, it will have neutral
or negative domain --

579
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:40,528
neutral or negative reputation.

580
00:26:40,528 --> 00:26:43,660
So, again, reputation services,
looking at that,

581
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,429
that's a hard thing
to overcome in domain names.

582
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,957
So after you're in a network,

583
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:56,660
rarely do you land
where you need to be.

584
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,000
At this point, it's important
to move laterally

585
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,264
and find the things
you need to find.

586
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:07,659
So, um, the big question
you need to think about

587
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,099
is if you have an intrusion
somewhere in your network,

588
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:14,165
can you then defend
against this lateral movement?

589
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,924
If you think about it,
most networks,

590
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:20,792
big castle walls,
hard, crunchy outer shell,

591
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,858
soft, gooey center.

592
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:24,330
How do you get to the point

593
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,099
where you know
you have an intrusion,

594
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:29,297
and you're gonna keep somebody
and make it difficult

595
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:30,495
for them to move from the place

596
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:32,099
they landed, uh,
to the --

597
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:34,165
to the place
they need to be?

598
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:35,428
And so, again,

599
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:39,132
network segmentation,
monitoring, uh,

600
00:27:39,132 --> 00:27:41,627
caring about your, um,

601
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:44,132
the accesses
that allow these privileges,

602
00:27:44,132 --> 00:27:47,099
they're all really
important pieces.

603
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,396
Um, so advanced attackers really
go for the crown jewels, right?

604
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:53,264
They're gonna go
for those domain admins, um,

605
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:55,065
to control the entire network.

606
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:58,363
You really need to limit
the administrator privileges,

607
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:02,363
segment the accesses, enforce
two-factor authentication.

608
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:06,363
Um, nothing is really
more frustrating to us

609
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:09,231
than to be inside a network,

610
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:11,066
know where the thing is
you need to go get to

611
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:14,231
and not have a path
to get over to find that.

612
00:28:18,957 --> 00:28:23,495
So the other thing
is, um, you know,

613
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,693
poorly considered
trust relationships.

614
00:28:25,693 --> 00:28:27,792
I talked earlier
about the amorphous edge

615
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,890
of your networks, um,

616
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:31,660
allowing any network --

617
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,891
any user or any net
computer with, uh,

618
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:36,132
with valid credentials

619
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:38,165
to access the network
from anywhere.

620
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:41,363
Um, that's a poor idea,
a huge risk.

621
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:42,858
Better networks employ things

622
00:28:42,858 --> 00:28:45,528
like comply to connect
for remote access.

623
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:47,924
Um, they connect, um,

624
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:50,693
and assure the security
of the remote connections,

625
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:53,561
maybe even figuring out
physical locations, um,

626
00:28:53,561 --> 00:28:55,659
where you're calling
from in, um,

627
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:58,891
seeing some really interesting
things with dynamic privileges,

628
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:01,858
thinking about you can access
pieces of information

629
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:03,231
from inside your network

630
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:04,660
but not from out,

631
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,396
inside the state but not out.

632
00:29:07,396 --> 00:29:08,956
Um, so --
so there's ways

633
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,099
to limit and consider
the segmentation

634
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:12,825
in a creative way.

635
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:18,198
Um, if you really want
to make my life hard,

636
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:20,528
you segment,
you manage the trust

637
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:22,396
to the most important places.

638
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:25,858
Um, you consider
who really needs that trust

639
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:30,099
and who should be able
to access those things.

640
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:33,593
I think another key thought
that people don't have is

641
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:37,165
consider how, um,

642
00:29:37,165 --> 00:29:39,561
consider that you're already
penetrated, right?

643
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,362
Do you have the means
and methods

644
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,660
to understand if somebody's
inside your network?

645
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,759
If you --
if you read statistics,

646
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:49,693
Verizon does a great intrusion
report every year.

647
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:53,627
Look at the statistics for how
long intrusions go undetected,

648
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:56,066
months or years, right,
after people are inside.

649
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:59,495
So what do you have
to understand and contain, um,

650
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:01,858
after that first --
first pieces?

651
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:05,066
Um, so monitoring and detection
inside the networks

652
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:07,825
is just as important
as that network boundary.

653
00:30:07,825 --> 00:30:11,528
And -- and many networks, they
don't have incident responses --

654
00:30:11,528 --> 00:30:12,825
response plans.

655
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:15,957
And if they do, they rarely
exercise them, right?

656
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:18,858
Have you ever
seen incident response plan

657
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,231
exercised inside your network?

658
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,527
So the Internet of things,

659
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:34,924
the boundary conditions,
all bringing things

660
00:30:34,924 --> 00:30:37,891
that are probably untrusted
inside your network.

661
00:30:37,891 --> 00:30:40,165
Um, why go after

662
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:43,330
the professionally administered
enterprise network

663
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,759
when people
are bringing their home laptops

664
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,033
that their kids
were going out and go

665
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:50,527
and downloading Steam games
the night before, right,

666
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:52,594
inside your network
and trust unit.

667
00:30:52,594 --> 00:30:54,264
What's that trust boundary?

668
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:57,462
Um, and then
as we mentioned earlier,

669
00:30:57,462 --> 00:30:58,792
the Internet of things,

670
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:01,759
there is now getting to be
a whole SCADA network

671
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,660
running in parallel,
sometimes interconnected,

672
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,198
to your whole corporate network.

673
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,099
Have we thought about those, uh,
those security elements?

674
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:13,396
Ron Rivest, you know, made
a great point earlier today.

675
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:15,528
Um, have we got
those things right?

676
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:17,495
Do we need to invest more
in those --

677
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:20,296
those technologies
to secure and defend there?

678
00:31:20,297 --> 00:31:22,033
Absolutely.

679
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:31,165
So at that point, we own you.

680
00:31:31,165 --> 00:31:32,759
All that's left to do
is collect,

681
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,792
exfil and exploit, right?

682
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:36,627
So once inside a network,

683
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:38,825
the main focus
is getting what you need,

684
00:31:38,825 --> 00:31:42,561
getting it out and,
uh, leaving undetected.

685
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:45,297
So data theft is one arena, um,

686
00:31:45,297 --> 00:31:47,495
but I challenge you to think
about a new one, right?

687
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:48,792
In the wake of Sony attacks,

688
00:31:48,792 --> 00:31:51,593
everybody's got
to think about, right,

689
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:53,033
I've got my basket of eggs.

690
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:54,561
I've got my most
important things.

691
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:56,824
I've defended them.
I've instrumented them.

692
00:31:56,825 --> 00:31:58,495
I've packed them
ever so carefully

693
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:00,956
in that bubble wrap
and kept it off to the side

694
00:32:00,957 --> 00:32:03,429
with my best security practices.

695
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:06,132
Um, what about
the destructive attack?

696
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,066
Um, so off-site backups need
to be part of your plan.

697
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:12,198
Figuring out how you're
gonna deal with data corruption,

698
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:14,660
data manipulation
or data destruction.

699
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,561
Um, it --
it really needs to be something

700
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,197
you're thinking about now.

701
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:21,627
Don't be that Saudi Aramco,
that Sony, um,

702
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:24,858
that learns about it afterwards
and then is improving.

703
00:32:24,858 --> 00:32:26,693
Um, you've got
to think about it now.

704
00:32:29,726 --> 00:32:31,264
So the other thing I'd point out

705
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:36,033
is you've got to differentiate
between the cyber criminals

706
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:38,659
and the nation-state intruders.

707
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,132
So last weekend we had
the huge snowstorm

708
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:43,627
on the east coast.

709
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:46,792
Turns out my neighborhood,
in the middle of the night,

710
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:49,165
one guy walked
through the neighborhood,

711
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,792
came through the whole court,

712
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:54,165
checking every car door
to see what was unlocked.

713
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:56,659
Took anything that wasn't
nailed down in unlocked cars.

714
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,231
Didn't break a window.
Didn't pick a lock.

715
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:02,693
Just took, opportunistically,
whatever he could, right?

716
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:06,726
Um, that's a lot of
the Internet malware or badware.

717
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,561
It's looking for credit cards

718
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:10,890
and opportunities
to use your machine

719
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:12,495
to send spam and make money,

720
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:15,593
to do crypto locker
and lock down

721
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:18,165
and extort you for money.

722
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:21,726
But at that point, um,
you know, they're opportunistic.

723
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:25,363
They're looking for the back,
weak gazelle in the pack

724
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:27,495
to pick off, right?

725
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:29,824
If you're looking
at the nation-state hackers,

726
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:31,264
we're gonna be persistent.

727
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:34,264
We're gonna keep coming
and coming and coming.

728
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:37,396
So you've got to be
defending and improving

729
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:39,132
and defending and improving

730
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:41,858
and evaluating
and improving, right?

731
00:33:41,858 --> 00:33:45,165
The static person is gonna float
to the back of the pack

732
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:47,495
and not for the crimeware,

733
00:33:47,495 --> 00:33:50,231
but for the nation-state
advanced hacker, um,

734
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:52,066
they're gonna find those CVEs,

735
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,825
those things
that are not patched.

736
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,099
They're gonna find ways in
that aren't monitored.

737
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,462
They're gonna steal credentials.

738
00:33:57,462 --> 00:33:59,660
They're going
to get to those pieces.

739
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
So don't be that easy mark.

740
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:07,297
Anybody holding up the camera?

741
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,594
Who's gonna scan the QR code
from the NSA guy?

742
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:13,462
All right.

743
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:17,924
[ Applause ]

744
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:19,726
So that is a link.
It's a real link.

745
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:22,033
It's not a rickroll, I promise.

746
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:24,759
Trust me.

747
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:26,659
Um, so -- so --

748
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:30,362
so I'd encourage you to go
to the NSA website.

749
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:33,033
There is some awesome material

750
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:35,495
that keeps you from being
at the back of the herd, right?

751
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:36,956
It -- it is tough to defend

752
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:39,560
against that nation-state
advanced persistent threat.

753
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:43,561
But -- but you really can make
a huge, huge difference.

754
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:44,792
So you ought to be
tightening down

755
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,000
and learning
some of these lessons, right?

756
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,792
So thank you for your time
and attention.

757
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:47,792
