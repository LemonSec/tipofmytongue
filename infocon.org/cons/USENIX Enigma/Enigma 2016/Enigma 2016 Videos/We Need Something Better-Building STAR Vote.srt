♪♪

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,891
Thank you. It's my pleasure to be with you today.

4
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:16,198
I am a child of the '60s.

5
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:21,495
I came of age with Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin.

6
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:24,066
Glenn Fry and the Eagles

7
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,396
and Ozzy Osborne and Black Sabbath

8
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:29,957
were brand-new, fledgling bands back then.

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:38,891
In my first voting experience, at age 18,

10
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:43,263
I used a lever machine with a poll curtain.

11
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,066
It was 1972.

12
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:48,330
The Vietnam War was at its height

13
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,396
and we were the first group of 18-year-olds

14
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:53,297
granted the right to vote.

15
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:56,495
I worked in my first polling place that year

16
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:59,891
and I thought the job unbearably boring.

17
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,131
As an elections administrator,

18
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:08,429
I came from the era of punchcard voting.

19
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:13,132
I inherited an aging punchcard system in 1987,

20
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,825
when I was first elected county clerk.

21
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,825
The issues about elections

22
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:20,033
had not been important in the campaign.

23
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:26,858
Preparing for my first election night,

24
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:29,264
I was with the county's IT director,

25
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:32,396
looking at the air-driven punchcard readers

26
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:35,165
and, looking into the inside of those card readers,

27
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:38,660
I saw hundreds of tiny little paper ovals

28
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,594
and, when I asked the IT guy, "What is all of this?",

29
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:45,428
he says to me, "Those are votes."

30
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,528
From that point on, I took 3 years working

31
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:52,462
to replace that punchcard system.

32
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:55,627
Primarily because of the low cost,

33
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:57,396
Travis County purchased

34
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:03,132
a central-count optical scan system in late 1991.

35
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:06,792
We used it for 12 years, until it became

36
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:11,792
just too unwieldy to manage the ballot inventory

37
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:16,198
for about 30 high-volume early voting locations.

38
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:18,561
Further, the logistics of trying to manage,

39
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:21,528
in the state of Texas, voter intent

40
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:26,000
and sorting mismarks was just too time-consuming

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,264
and it was difficult to get election results completed

42
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:33,759
before 2:00 in the morning.

43
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,857
A recount of a close election

44
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:40,165
carries the risk of reversing the original outcome.

45
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:43,594
It was better to endure the criticisms

46
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:45,891
of being really slow,

47
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:50,626
than to risk the less-than-accurate results.

48
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:58,264
I could've processed the ballots with --

49
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:00,528
I could've processed these ballots much more quickly,

50
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,231
if I had just ignored the law

51
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:06,858
and not done all of that work to take care of mismarks.

52
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:10,264
And many, many counties in Texas did just exactly that.

53
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:12,627
However, mismarks and misreads

54
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:15,330
are very common in optical scan systems

55
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,627
And, in the 29 years that I've been conducting elections,

56
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:21,627
I have never had a reversal in a recount.

57
00:03:25,429 --> 00:03:28,627
To elections administrators, at first,

58
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:33,495
electronic voting seemed like such a godsend.

59
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:36,396
It was faster and more accurate.

60
00:03:36,396 --> 00:03:38,660
It also offered elections administrators

61
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,692
an auditable way to manage the paper overload

62
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:48,792
of ballot formats endemic to early voting programs,

63
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:52,165
as well as the trend towards joint elections.

64
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,594
It had more flexibility with ballot design

65
00:03:55,594 --> 00:03:57,363
and we had all hoped

66
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:59,759
for something much better for the voter.

67
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,528
That was more than 15 years ago.

68
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:06,033
Elections administrators

69
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:09,231
did not design electronic voting systems,

70
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:12,759
nor did we write the laws that required their use,

71
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,329
but in the 15 years since,

72
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,264
very little about this equipment has changed in the marketplace.

73
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:22,495
Virtually all, if not all,

74
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,825
of the equipment on the market today

75
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:27,330
has the exact same vulnerabilities

76
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,825
as were pointed out all those years ago,

77
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:33,264
even though elections administrators

78
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:35,033
have repeatedly asked

79
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:38,561
for improvements in voting system design.

80
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:44,495
Today, Travis County still has the eSlate Hart voting system

81
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:47,627
that was purchased in late 2001.

82
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:52,033
The members of the election verification network, EVM,

83
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,792
and other experts have taken the time

84
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:59,429
to teach me a great deal about electronic voting security.

85
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:02,626
Given the security vulnerabilities possible

86
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:04,198
for eSlate,

87
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:07,594
we began to use the lessons that had been taught

88
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:12,561
in order to try to defend eSlate using mitigation techniques.

89
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:19,164
No one mitigation technique is going to be sufficient

90
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:22,891
to defend against different kinds of attacks,

91
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:28,561
so, we begin with basic security: physical security.

92
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:31,626
In 2003, we moved into a new building

93
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:35,165
that had an elections warehouse and it allowed us to set up

94
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:38,594
security perimeters, electronic locks,

95
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:41,231
and assigned badges that only allowed

96
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:45,429
designated personnel into certain locations.

97
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,857
Additional locks and security cameras were installed,

98
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:51,132
as well as fire suppression measures

99
00:05:51,132 --> 00:05:53,825
and water damage barriers.

100
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:56,495
We implemented new policies and procedures

101
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:59,858
for the use of laptops and other peripherals,

102
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:02,165
and a very restrictive policy

103
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:05,759
to protect against potential outside contaminants,

104
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
such as discs, thumb drives, and downloads.

105
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,891
Now, only authorized drives

106
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,660
operated by appropriate personnel,

107
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,264
in teams of at least two, are allowed.

108
00:06:19,264 --> 00:06:24,528
So let's talk about our mitigation techniques.

109
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:26,528
We use logic and accuracy testing

110
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:28,693
and we use it in two different ways.

111
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:32,429
First, we execute logic and accuracy proofing.

112
00:06:32,429 --> 00:06:33,924
Using stakeholders

113
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:36,561
who are familiar with the names of the candidates

114
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,495
and with the measures of the ballots,

115
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:42,594
we review every ballot format for the correct spelling

116
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:45,330
and pronunciation of each candidate's name

117
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,032
and for the text of the amendments,

118
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,924
in both English and Spanish.

119
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:53,495
Second, we use logic and accuracy testing

120
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:55,132
to again prove up

121
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:58,924
that all of the candidates are in the right precincts,

122
00:06:58,924 --> 00:07:01,825
that all the precincts are in the right districts,

123
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:05,264
and that all of that is tallying appropriately.

124
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:08,528
If we make mistakes in running this report,

125
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:13,033
we start all over, rather than trying to reconcile the errors.

126
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:21,792
We have worked continuously to try to reduce our error rate

127
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,957
and make logic and accuracy testing

128
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,627
as worker-friendly as possible.

129
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:30,627
We've taken lessons from our accessibility advocates

130
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:32,759
to make our data-entry materials

131
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,660
easier to read and track accurately.

132
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,165
For example, we've increased the font

133
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:41,330
on the Excel spreadsheets, to reduce eye strain

134
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,363
and the risk of entering interposed digits.

135
00:07:45,363 --> 00:07:48,330
We found that election workers were more energetic

136
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,000
and felt less drained when they could move through

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,528
the testing in smaller segments, say, 50 lines at a time,

138
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:58,594
rather than trying to complete an entire ballot format.

139
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:01,891
And we used teams of three people

140
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:03,858
to try to perform the data entry.

141
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,099
One person types the entries, while the other person

142
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,594
calls out the number they're trying to enter,

143
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:13,330
and a third person checks the accuracy of the entry.

144
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,659
They use rulers and highlighters to mark their progress

145
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,693
and these accessibility improvements

146
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:22,527
have greatly reduced our error rate

147
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:24,891
and speeded the time needed

148
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,891
to conduct a complete test of the ballot.

149
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:34,593
We also use hashcode tests and we use them

150
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:39,528
because we want every election to start off on the right foot.

151
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:44,033
Election system vendors submit hash codes to NIST

152
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:47,660
for each major part of their voting system.

153
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:53,462
We test approximately 100 parts of the eSlate voting system,

154
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:56,693
so it's not just done one time.

155
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,824
We download, however, a hash master,

156
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:03,231
rather than use a vendor-provided disk.

157
00:09:10,693 --> 00:09:14,957
Future election systems that have built-in security

158
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:18,627
may eliminate the need for hashcode testing at all.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,363
These testing and mitigation techniques

160
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,231
are necessary for basic system security,

161
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:30,528
yet they do not answer all of the possibilities

162
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,198
for a security breach.

163
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,363
It may be possible for a bad actor

164
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:39,396
to place a Trojan horse or a timebomb into the software

165
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:43,132
and have it hidden until it pops into action.

166
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:44,593
Other mitigation techniques

167
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:47,264
won't reveal this kind of security breach,

168
00:09:47,264 --> 00:09:51,132
so another kind of technique is needed.

169
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:56,462
We may not be able to prevent this kind of Trojan attack,

170
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,462
but we might be able to stop it, if it occurs,

171
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:03,132
by using a test called parallel monitoring.

172
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:05,329
We trick the voting booth

173
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,429
into thinking it's going into a regular voting situation.

174
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:12,560
Just before voting is to begin,

175
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:15,297
we randomly remove a set of equipment

176
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:18,594
from what's assigned to go into the field,

177
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:21,396
and we make no changes to its assignment.

178
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:22,791
At the proper hour,

179
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:26,858
voting commences, in a normal, yet random, way.

180
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:30,791
County clerk employees vote ballots throughout the day,

181
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:35,858
as assigned, making sure they correctly enter the choices.

182
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:38,593
The voting exercise is also videotaped,

183
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:41,759
in the event of questions, and parallel monitoring

184
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,462
is conducted for all the days of early voting,

185
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:47,593
as well as throughout election day.

186
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:54,957
What I ask sometimes is: is it possible

187
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:57,759
that there would be a little less concern

188
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,825
about electronic voting if all of our jurisdictions

189
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:05,231
had used these mitigation techniques

190
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,099
for electronic voting?

191
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:12,297
Would these tests have bought us a little more time

192
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,396
to figure out how to manage electronic voting,

193
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,396
if we had been able to work together?

194
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:20,198
It's too much water under the bridge now

195
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:22,824
and we will never know the answer to that question.

196
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:26,132
However, what I can tell you is that defending

197
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:33,132
against a 360° possibility of attacks is laborious,

198
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:38,593
expensive, and it ultimately may not even be successful.

199
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:43,264
When the news about the VW cheating scandal was outed,

200
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:47,396
I wondered what possibilities that meant for voting systems

201
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:51,165
and would these techniques, such as parallel monitoring,

202
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:52,693
have caught the problem?

203
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:59,198
Elections administrators have seen voting system development

204
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:01,957
bog down over the last 10 years,

205
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:06,264
caught up in a slow and expensive regulatory system.

206
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:09,231
The Election Assistance Commission Certification Program

207
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:12,165
shows recent signs of new life

208
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,560
and attention to a faster process.

209
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:21,297
Meanwhile, in the last 10 years, our culture has sped forward.

210
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:24,693
Voters live faster lives and we use smartphones

211
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:27,000
and the Internet as second nature.

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,033
The not-so-well-intentioned have also become more advanced

213
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,891
and have brought computer security issues

214
00:12:33,891 --> 00:12:36,495
to even higher levels of sophistication,

215
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:38,858
especially in elections.

216
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,758
And, in the meantime, elections administrators struggle

217
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,132
to force old technology into newer practices,

218
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,462
to meet the needs of today's voters,

219
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:52,660
who demand vote centers, retail early voting,

220
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,363
and electronic overseas balloting,

221
00:12:55,363 --> 00:13:00,396
while we try to protect the integrity of the count.

222
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:04,098
We refer to this photo as "I Survived T4",

223
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:08,033
the terrible tally tape test, which took 5 days

224
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:11,165
and hundreds of staff hours to complete.

225
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,891
Now, zero tapes and tally tapes

226
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,593
are commonly used to prove that voting equipment

227
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,726
has no residual tally totals left on it.

228
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:21,000
Zero tapes are traditionally printed out

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,858
just before polls open, to prove that we're starting at zero;

230
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:27,693
a very simple security test.

231
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:31,561
Similarly, tally tapes were printed at the election day

232
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:36,066
precinct voting locations, just prior to transport

233
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,165
to the central counting station location,

234
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:42,000
to establish how much the vote was at that particular location.

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,858
And, at the end of voting, the tally tapes were posted

236
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,329
to the door of the precinct polling location,

237
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,693
for interested citizens to view.

238
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:56,824
Travis County no longer uses precinct polling locations.

239
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:59,825
We use vote centers. And let me tell you why.

240
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:04,825
It was because of a bad redistricting experience

241
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:07,396
and a court-delayed primary.

242
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,627
Now, what is the difference between precinct voting

243
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:12,032
and vote centers? In precinct voting,

244
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:15,165
only the qualified residents of the neighborhood precinct

245
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,791
are allowed to vote in that neighborhood,

246
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,792
while, in the vote center model,

247
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,660
any qualified voter of the county

248
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,231
may vote at any one of the vote centers

249
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,660
throughout anywhere in the county on election day.

250
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,495
All of the ballot formats

251
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:33,528
are available in every one of the vote center locations.

252
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:35,231
And it's very similar to early voting,

253
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,594
if you know what that is.

254
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:40,000
Now, what happened to the problem was

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,330
that we had to go to vote centers

256
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,099
because, in redistricting, 96% of the polling places

257
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:47,858
had their boundaries redrawn

258
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:51,462
and almost every location had a new polling place.

259
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:53,726
In a state that required you to be

260
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,825
in the proper location, in order for your ballot to count,

261
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:59,561
we would've had rampant disenfranchisement

262
00:14:59,561 --> 00:15:01,132
within the primary election.

263
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:03,231
We could not allow that to happen,

264
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:06,297
so what we said was "We're going to go to vote centers."

265
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:08,495
Now, because the database in vote centers

266
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,726
is now so extremely higher

267
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,429
than just the little neighborhood precincts,

268
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:17,824
we ended up having to run a much longer test.

269
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:19,528
So, with this test --

270
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,099
Dan, could I get your help here?

271
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:25,957
Now, what use to be a simple security test

272
00:15:25,957 --> 00:15:27,924
looks like this.

273
00:15:27,924 --> 00:15:32,693
This is one of 15 rolls of the simple security test,

274
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:39,363
proving there are no residual totals on the machines.

275
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:41,726
And we can no longer perform it in the field

276
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:45,792
because this test takes 7 hours to run

277
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:48,726
and you can't get results while this is running.

278
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:53,264
This also has become, now, an opportunity for attack

279
00:15:53,264 --> 00:15:57,429
and gives the election judge plausible deniability.

280
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:01,726
The test has now become something to be used against us.

281
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:04,858
All right. I want to talk a little bit about STAR Vote.

282
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:07,198
Professor Dan Wallach here,

283
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,198
along with Philip Stark and Josh Benaloh,

284
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,660
and eight or nine of some of the finest minds you will ever meet,

285
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,065
donated their time and talent to help develop STAR Vote.

286
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:22,561
It's taken us years, but the STAR Vote group

287
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:25,858
has made important and significant process.

288
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:28,758
The request for information has gone out and come back

289
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,132
and we've learned some important lessons from that;

290
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:34,132
and the request for proposal is about to go out again,

291
00:16:34,132 --> 00:16:35,627
where we ask somebody to actually

292
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,791
build STAR Vote for us.

293
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:40,957
What we are designing is an electronic voting system

294
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:43,297
with the best of both worlds.

295
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:46,792
We want electronic speed and accuracy

296
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:51,264
with end-to-end verification and with a paper backup ballot

297
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:53,792
for on-the-spot voter verification

298
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,165
and audit and recount purposes.

299
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:59,824
STAR Vote vote team has also taken the design further,

300
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:02,627
by including encryption in the software

301
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:05,000
and a public bulletin board

302
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,297
for voters to participate in additional verification.

303
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:16,363
The concept of STAR Vote has been both tedious and exciting.

304
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:19,000
The STAR Vote group has spent time hammering out

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,791
our own disagreements and we've figured out a way

306
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,824
to include risk-limiting audits in the design

307
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:27,924
and, now, we're ready to start building STAR Vote.

308
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:31,066
We estimate that it will take at least 2 years

309
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:34,396
just to write the code.

310
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:37,462
But STAR Vote needs more than just answers

311
00:17:37,462 --> 00:17:41,066
to questions about managing open-source systems.

312
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:44,693
It needs a home to operate out of.

313
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:47,561
It needs infrastructure to organize financing,

314
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:50,033
software management, upgrades,

315
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:53,264
and it needs to conduct field support for counties.

316
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:57,428
I look forward to talking to you more about STAR Vote later,

317
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:00,891
and especially as we proceed with this ambitious project.

318
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:05,825
Ultimately, we'd like to deliver an open-source voting system

319
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:10,132
that uses COTS hardware, offers counties the opportunity

320
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:14,462
to significantly reduce the cost of the initial

321
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:17,363
and the ongoing software maintenance costs

322
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:20,363
that current proprietary systems charge.

323
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:26,924
We want greater security at a lesser cost to taxpayers.

324
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:28,495
All right. Merle King,

325
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:30,824
Dr. Merle King, out of Kennesaw State University,

326
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:36,759
compiled a list of the top-10 common election security myths

327
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,495
and he got it from Dr. Roger Johnson's

328
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:44,197
published list in the Journal of Physical Security in 2012.

329
00:18:44,198 --> 00:18:47,330
And his number-2 myth on the list is

330
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,858
that electronic voting machine security is the main issue.

331
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:53,131
No.

332
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,594
The reality is the main issue

333
00:18:55,594 --> 00:19:00,165
is having a healthy security culture in elections.

334
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:03,033
The fact that current electronic voting machines

335
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:06,065
have little or no security built in

336
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,792
really is part of a weak security culture,

337
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:12,231
where manufacturers are not held accountable

338
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,792
for making secure machines.

339
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,495
Some of the other critical attributes

340
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:18,758
of a healthy security culture include:

341
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:21,693
a strong focus on security,

342
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,693
a willingness to think like the bad guys,

343
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:29,330
openness to criticism and suggestion,

344
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,264
and an avoidance of denial.

345
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:36,956
That's where this group can be of so much help in the future.

346
00:19:36,957 --> 00:19:40,924
STAR Vote is a good example of the positive step forward

347
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:45,561
we can take when we work together in elections.

348
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,099
It's important that elections administrators

349
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:52,561
learn as much as possible about all the facets of security,

350
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:57,792
from basic physical security to more complex attempts

351
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:01,824
to hack or disrupt election services.

352
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:05,264
Elections administrators are not the group to blame

353
00:20:05,264 --> 00:20:08,264
for poor product development.

354
00:20:08,264 --> 00:20:10,858
They are, however, the best group

355
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:16,000
to teach how to defend against attacks in the field.

356
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,594
Please help me and other elections administrators

357
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,198
who want to do a better job

358
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:26,363
of protecting the votes and voters of our democracy.

359
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:28,429
Between elections administrators

360
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:30,858
and the computer security community,

361
00:20:30,858 --> 00:20:33,033
there are many opportunities

362
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:37,824
to create a healthy security culture in elections.

363
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:41,429
We can build upon our fledgling relationships.

364
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,891
We can promote more goodwill

365
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:47,363
and opportunities to meet and talk together

366
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:52,099
and prove that, when theory meets real life,

367
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:56,593
we are exactly the team that can deliver success.

368
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:58,924
Thank you for listening to me today.

369
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,561
And, for those of you that have helped me,

370
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,066
thank you very much

371
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:05,957
for educating me about the culture of security.
