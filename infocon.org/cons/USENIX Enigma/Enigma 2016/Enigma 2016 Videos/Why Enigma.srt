1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,170
all of our crown jewels on the internet
but maybe you we have not quite figured

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,320
out yet how to protect you know all of
them against the various lets the

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,510
buffets Inc the risks and threats kind
of what people can do with technology

4
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,140
are on people's minds to minimize it
brings together a whole bunch of

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,580
security professionals seasoned
professionals who work on assessing the

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,359
security of deployed computer systems we
can actually talk about emerging threats

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,400
new trends and have that in a setting we
can bring all kinds of players together

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,750
the goal is to create a synergy among
folks working in industry folks working

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,550
in academia and folks working in
government bring them all together under

10
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,239
one roof and helpful in this community

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,630
we spent a lot of time reaching out to
changing researchers and we're really

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:59,250
working with them very closely to make
sure that they craft their message in

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,280
the best way they'd cancel that you know
people who have been on the space are

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,610
ready for a long time can go there and
actually learn something new and then

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,230
you know take that into the whole way to
talk with their colleagues or friends

16
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,470
and you know sort of get this and that
she that allows us to come up with new

17
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,729
ideas we have a really wide gamut topics
anywhere from automated security and

18
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:25,690
security of Internet of Things to
election security it was actually really

19
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,160
important that we wanted to include
something I'm voting because it's

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,600
election season it's just a fact of
computer security that they learn how to

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,839
defend computer systems you must learn
about all the latest and greatest

22
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,619
attacks and that's exactly what you
gonna be getting an email

23
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:42,979
yes let's create something new that
still considering all the players

24
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:47,740
together and then really educate people
and have that be an experience where

25
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,179
everybody says yes actually I need to go
to any of this one conference I go to

26
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:52,950
its common view that
