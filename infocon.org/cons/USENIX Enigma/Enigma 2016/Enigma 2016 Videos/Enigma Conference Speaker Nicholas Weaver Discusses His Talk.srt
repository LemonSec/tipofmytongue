1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:09,120
my background is network measurement and
network security so I worked on

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,820
intrusion detection malcolm how the
network operates how the internet

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,009
workers interfere and when the snow
documents came out I realized that this

4
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:26,660
is what I did that the technologies
involved in the surveillance especially

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,650
surveillance on the internet and the
technologies involved in defending your

6
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:37,000
own network are in many ways the same so
you're a us- business travel traveling

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,750
overseas well you're probably in scope
for foreign intelligence activities so

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,910
you need to understand what the threats
are and we need to build systems which

9
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,319
would allow you to communicate safely
and the first step is understand the

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,510
attacker how powerful are these
surveillance assessment how you see are

11
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,260
these surveillance systems to build what
are the limits on deploying them and how

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,120
can we countered
