-Hello.

5
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:10,693
First of all, I want to thank you

6
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:16,231
for the much warmer weather here than where I was previously.

00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,660
Snowmageddon wasn't so fun.

So, today, I want to talk to you

9
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:23,957
about how cybercriminals are using

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,231

and dark-market exploration.

14
00:00:35,924 --> 00:00:38,957
What I'm about to share with you is something that came out of

15
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:41,660
my firsthand experience fighting cyber fraud

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,297
and then my passion of wanting to understand how it works.

17
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:50,627
About six months ago, my colleagues and I were alerted

18
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:54,759
to a bunch of simultaneous increases in strange traffic

19
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:57,924
to multiple customer web properties.

20
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,924
When we dug into the traffic,

21
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:01,858
we found that customer-log-in URLs

22
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:04,000
were being targeted by scripts that were rolling

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,297
through large sets of log-in credentials.

24
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:12,462
Automated account checkers -- we've seen these before.

25
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:15,627
Now, typically, they target e-commerce, retail,

26
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:19,066
travel, those sorts of web properties.

27
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,627
And what they do is they use log-in details

28
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:24,594
gleaned from breaches of other websites,

29
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:25,890
and then they will try those log-ins

30
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,561
again and again on these customers

31
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,792
that they're targeting.

32
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,231
Now, what they're doing is they're counting on people

33
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,792
reusing the same log-ins across multiple websites.

34
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:38,396
Nobody here does that, right?

35
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,825
All right, so, we've seen this before,

36
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:45,330
we know what to do, we've got the playbook for it.

37
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,495
We're gonna run it.

38
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:48,330
We see that the I.P. is spewing out

39
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,330
all of the malicious traffic.

40
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,792
What they are mostly is virtual-shared hosting,

41
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:57,198
you know, vulnerable WordPress, Joomla!, and other CMS systems,

42
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,758
Mac botnet I.P.s, and consumer I.P.s.

43
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,033
Most of these consumer I.P.s, we were able to figure out,

44
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,924
were actually popped home routers

45
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,924
and NAS devices that were hacked.

46
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:10,495
So, now we just find the solid request patterns,

47
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:14,495
we drop some geoblocks in place, we fire up our I.P. blacklists,

48
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:17,429
and then we start serving up some 403 responses --

49
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,924
easy enough and finished in time for lunch.

50
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:21,594
What more could you ask for?

51
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:26,594
Apparently, a lot more.

52
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,132
So, what we ran into this time

53
00:02:28,132 --> 00:02:29,858
that was different than the previous times

54
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,330
we fought off these guys is,

55
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,363
unlike the times that we did before,

56
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,957
now they're not just buzzing off and finding softer targets.

57
00:02:38,957 --> 00:02:41,594
They're coming back at us with new techniques.

58
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,231
Our geoblocks and our I.P. blacklists --

59
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:47,263
they were met with a flood of new, rotating I.P. addresses

60
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:50,330
coming from VPN services and a series of different

61
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,825
open and private proxies.

62
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:58,957
Hola, I'm looking at you for one of the big contenders here.

63
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:01,396
And the previous request patterns that we set in place

64
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:04,726
to match against their traffic became useless to us.

65
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,693
They started switching up their user agents,

66
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:08,957
and they started switching up the actual order

67
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:10,594
of their headers.

68
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:14,066
All right, fine. Emeril Lagasse time.

69
00:03:14,066 --> 00:03:17,495
Bam -- tightened rate controls on the log-in URLs.

70
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:20,660
Bam -- valid refer checks.

71
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,858
Come at me, bro. I've got you.

72
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,330
So, the illegitimate traffic to the log-in URLs

73
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,396
we were defending starts dropping off pretty quickly.

74
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,329
Awesome. We've got it.

75
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, not so much.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, now they just start hitting the mobile ABIs

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,495
and starting hitting the really,

78
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:42,066
really interesting legacy log-in paths

79
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:45,264
that the customer developers left in place

80
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:48,033
and didn't realize were still publicly available.

81
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,363
So, now this tit for tat isn't really working for us,

82
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:52,924
and we have to get smart about

83
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:54,627
how we're responding to these guys

84
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:59,891
because they're meeting each of our ways of blocking them.

85
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,825
So, what if we get a little more subtle

86
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,033
in how we're dealing with them?

87
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,594
So, what we're gonna do here is we're going

88
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:11,165
to stop blocking out the requests

89
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:14,132
so they switch I.P.s or go through another proxy,

90
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:15,462
and we're gonna start tarpitting them

91
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:16,627
or long-routing them.

92
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:18,957
We're gonna make their traffic really slow,

93
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,132
but not be stopped or timed out.

94
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:23,297
And then, when they get to the end of that route,

95
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,429
we're gonna serve them up

96
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:27,032
a fake "You've successfully logged in" page.

97
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,957
So now they think, "Oh, these log-in credentials work,"

98
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:33,264
and they move on to the next set of credentials.

99
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:36,000
So, after this, we saw some smaller, follow-up waves,

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
but no further pivots sin techniques

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,264
because this gave us the time to work with the customers

102
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:43,495
to fix their API log-in logics,

103
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:47,099
and to nuke the legacy paths that were being exploited.

104
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:49,164
Finally, the siege was lifted.

105
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:53,132
Now, this was curious.

106
00:04:53,132 --> 00:04:54,594
This was a real break from the past

107
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,462
for these types of attacks.

108
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,164
The attackers really put a lot of thought and effort

109
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,396
into responding to our defensive maneuvers.

110
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:05,000
Now that we were no long in shit's-on-fire mode,

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,726
I wanted to figure out why they were using all of this time

112
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:10,792
and these resources to respond to us

113
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:12,890
instead of just going after easier targets,

114
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,660
like they have in the past.

115
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,957
So, the data in these types of accounts --

116
00:05:17,957 --> 00:05:22,891
PII, rewards points, miles, partial credit-card info --

117
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:26,165
this isn't anything that's changed from the past.

118
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:29,396
All that is about the same information.

119
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,561
And when I look at the legislative landscape

120
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,296
or the industries themselves,

121
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:36,099
there haven't been any significant changes

122
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:37,759
that should make the intrinsic value

123
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,165
of these accounts higher such that people want

124
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:44,396
to spend more resources going after them.

125
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,627
I guess that leaves the resell market

126
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:48,231
for these types of goods.

127
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,066
So, how did they monetize these accounts?

128
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:58,594
Now, the initial obvious path, of course, would be to go

129
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:01,033
for the credit-card information in the account.

130
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,297
But even when you log in

131
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,858
as the customer in these accounts,

132
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:07,660
you don't necessarily see the credit-card information in full.

133
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,231
So you can't just take it out and sell it that way.

134
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:11,462
What you'd have to do is go in

135
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,296
and use the card attached to the account

136
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:17,033
to buy more rewards, to buy points, to buy miles,

137
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,792
and sometimes to buy tangible goods

138
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,263
through the rewards store.

139
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:23,594
Now, they can take those purchased goods

140
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:26,000
and services, and they can resell them --

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,561
you know, things like watches, designer bags, gift cards,

142
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:31,363
that sort of thing.

143
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:33,363
After they changed the user's address info --

144
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:34,792
the shipping-address info --

145
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,330
then they can ship the tangible goods

146
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,758
to one of their drops,

147
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,924
and then they can go ahead and resell it -- you know,

148
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:45,032
something like Craigslist or eBay or Wallapop.

149
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:47,330
So, they could even use work-at-home mules

150
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,758
to do this reshipping for them

151
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,297
so they don't have to deal with the actual, tangible goods.

152
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:54,726
But then you run into issues like the mules flipping on you

153
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,561
because the cops are really looking hard

154
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:58,825
at these kind of reshipping schemes right now.

155
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:01,429
You also have to run the risk of your mules

156
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,758
just stealing your stuff and taking your money.

157
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,429
So, instead of dealing with all of that hassle,

158
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,626
is there a market for just the digital part

159
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:13,132
of these rewards accounts?

160
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,495
Is there a large enough market to make it worth it?

161
00:07:18,957 --> 00:07:21,198
And looking for markets selling these types of goods,

162
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:24,626
I wanted to make sure that they met a few conditions.

163
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:27,957
It needed to have quantifiable transaction histories.

164
00:07:27,957 --> 00:07:29,429
That's where I can go into the website

165
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:32,429
and actually see a history of a seller's transactions --

166
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:34,296
which ones have gone through, which ones failed,

167
00:07:34,297 --> 00:07:38,066
and the reviews of those transactions.

168
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:41,198
I also needed to have a way to make sure

169
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:44,626
that I wasn't funding crime directly.

170
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:48,231
If I went to a pay-to-play closed forum or IRC channel,

171
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:50,528
then I would be paying directly into criminals,

172
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:53,231
and the legal department at my work wouldn't be so happy

173
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:56,033
with me about that.

174
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,033
I also needed to make sure that the barriers to entry

175
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:00,363
weren't too high or too costly.

176
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,495
And what I mean by that is there are a lot of these forums

177
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:05,033
that have markets attached to them

178
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,792
that require another criminal to vouch for you.

179
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,395
And usually the way you do that is

180
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:13,231
by proving your own criminality to them.

181
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,264
I didn't want to get into that.

182
00:08:15,264 --> 00:08:17,627
I also wanted to make sure that these markets had

183
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:20,792
high enough traffic to make it worth the research.

184
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,890
This set of criteria led me to focus

185
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:27,495
on the darknet onion-router markets.

186
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:28,924
There are a lot of markets to choose from

187
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:32,495
with varying degrees of uptime, activity,

188
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:34,033
and volatility.

189
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,462
So, I chose to further narrow down the target markets

190
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:39,528
by selecting for those that were currently active

191
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:43,594
and that had an uptime greater than 95%.

192
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:45,660
In terms of activity and interest,

193
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,000
they needed to, as of November 2015,

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,693
have Google search impressions of greater than 60,000

195
00:08:52,693 --> 00:08:55,561
and Google keywords greater than 100.

196
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:02,792
This led me to look at these top three Tor markets --

197
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,330
AlphaBay, Dream Market, and Nucleus Market.

198
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,033
I knew these markets had a lot of drugs on offer,

199
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,627
but when it came to hacked goods,

200
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:14,165
I was admittedly surprised with what I found --

201
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,693
credit cards, accounts for Netflix, Hulu,

202
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:19,660
HBO, Spotify, stolen PayPal accounts,

203
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,033
Steam accounts, and a lot of porn-site memberships.

204
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,858
Across the three markets, there was a total

205
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:32,627
of 14,183 digital goods for sale,

206
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:37,231
things like hacked accounts, malware, e-gift cards.

207
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:40,495
And there were 15,426

208
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:45,495
specifically fraud-related digital goods for sale.

209
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:46,594
Those were things like

210
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:48,528
personally identifiable information --

211
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:50,033
we'll talk more about that later --

212
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:54,132
credit-card numbers, and bank drops.

213
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,660
Here's what I found inside of those numbers --

214
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,924
that there were whole accounts for sale --

215
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:00,759
these are rewards accounts --

216
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,132
where, specifically, the rewards or points balance

217
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,758
was called out as a sales feature

218
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,660
for these accounts.

219
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,891
I found 20 listings of these across 7 unique vendors,

220
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:17,495
with 2,014 confirmed sales.

221
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,231
What about the vouchers and e-gift cards

222
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:22,759
that you could get through these rewards accounts?

223
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,462
54 different listings across 13 unique vendors,

224
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:29,825
with 3,136 sales.

225
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:35,693
Now, when we're looking at just the rewards points,

226
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:39,495
there were only three listings across three unique vendors.

227
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:43,462
But they had a total of 698 sales between them.

228
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,462
Talk about cornering the market.

229
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:50,528
What about air miles? Those are worth a lot, right?

230
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:53,726
Here I only found 4 listings across 4 vendors,

231
00:10:53,726 --> 00:10:55,957
totaling in only 100 sales.

232
00:10:55,957 --> 00:10:57,528
What's going on there?

233
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:00,462
Well, I went to the different air-miles programs

234
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:02,330
and started to look at their policies,

235
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,198
and it turns out, within the past few years,

236
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,165
a large number of them have really cracked down

237
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,033
on their transfer policies

238
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:10,231
and make it very difficult to just transfer it.

239
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:14,363
Thus, its fungibility is lost.

240
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:16,363
So, out of all of this,

241
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:18,891
there is one section that really blew me away

242
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,726
that I wasn't expecting to be as large as it was --

243
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:25,099
personal criminal travel agents.

244
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,660
These listings offer highly discounted custom bookings

245
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,791
for flights, trains, and buses, cruises, hotels,

246
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:33,429
car rentals -- you name it.

247
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,165
They even have their own cancellation

248
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:37,759
and refund policies.

249
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,231
The way that these sellers assure you

250
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,462
that your travel won't be canceled

251
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:43,792
is they promise you they're not using stolen credit cards.

252
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,594
They're just using rewards points.

253
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:50,000
So, it might seem pretty sketchy and easily stoppable,

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,198
but something must be working

255
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:57,000
because I'm looking at 93 general listings,

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
94 custom orders across 31 unique vendors --

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,462
that's a lot of people in the marketplace --

258
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:09,132
with total sales of 4,808.

259
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:13,296
On top of this, the majority of them had rave reviews.

260
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,825
That's crazy.

261
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:17,330
What kind of timeline are we talking here?

262
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,627
Let's give some context to these numbers.

263
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:23,824
Well, these sales numbers are only since March 2015.

264
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:26,561
So, across 10 months,

265
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,594
in only 3 darknet markets,

266
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:35,198
there were 10,756 confirmed sales,

267
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:38,957
and these are all rewards-account-related goods.

268
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:40,528
And this isn't even counting the listings

269
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:41,825
that have been taken down

270
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:45,132
or the vendors that have since closed shop --

271
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,098
10,756.

272
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,957
I'd say there's a large enough market.

273
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,627
All right, so, these pushers of purloined points

274
00:12:55,627 --> 00:12:58,627
are making Bitcoin hand over fist.

275
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,593
Now they can use these Bitcoins to turn around

276
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:04,066
and purchase other things on the darknet market,

277
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,462
but how do they get cold, hard cash

278
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,924
without winding up in jail?

279
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:13,231
Here's where the cash-out technique is crucial.

280
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:15,462
The darknet markets aren't just full of drugs

281
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,924
and hacked accounts.

282
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:20,297
They're also filthy with guides on how to cash out safely.

283
00:13:20,297 --> 00:13:22,231
Many of these guides claim to have unique

284
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:25,297
of obscure processes for doing so.

285
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,693
Most of these guides start with the suggestion

286
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:30,165
of using a Bitcoin-tumbling service.

287
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,693
This is where your Bitcoins are mixed

288
00:13:31,693 --> 00:13:33,495
with a lot of other folks' Bitcoins

289
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:36,759
so that you get out new, fresher Bitcoins

290
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,132
that are harder to trace.

291
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:42,560
Some of these guides also suggested,

292
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:44,231
when you tumble your Bitcoins,

293
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:46,693
to do it in a series of small transactions

294
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,396
with differing amounts over a long period of time

295
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:53,593
to make it even harder to trace through the block chain.

296
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:57,264
So now they've got some "cleaner" Bitcoins,

297
00:13:57,264 --> 00:14:00,693
but they're still traceable by a decent forensics expert.

298
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:02,891
In fact, Damon McCoy, who spoke earlier,

299
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:05,363
has done some excellent work in this area.

300
00:14:05,363 --> 00:14:06,759
I highly suggest some of the papers

301
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,297
that he's written in tracing Bitcoins.

302
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,858
So, they can't just open up a Bitcoin exchange account

303
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:18,263
with Coinbase or Xapo or Circle.

304
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:20,891
All of these now comply with anti-money-laundering

305
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:24,495
and "know your customer" laws.

306
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:27,924
They require extensive background and identity checks.

307
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:31,957
So, if they can't verify their own identities,

308
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:34,593
how do they set up an exchange?

309
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:38,198
They can use somebody else's.

310
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:39,627
After all, in the United States,

311
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:43,560
somebody's identity is stolen every two seconds.

312
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:47,264
$16 billion worth of identity fraud

313
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:52,759
has affected almost 13 million people since 2014.

314
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,264
Since 2005, there have been about 5,700 breaches

315
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:01,363
of unencrypted personal information.

316
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:02,561
And within this, there has been

317
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:06,759
about 855 million of these records stolen.

318
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:11,263
So, naturally, what this means

319
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:13,858
is that back in the darknet markets,

320
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:16,329
there is a plethora of affordable listings

321
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,264
for something called fullz --

322
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:21,000
f-u-l-l-z.

323
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,198
One set of fullz costs between 10 and 20 bucks.

324
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:26,792
And what you get out of it is a pile of personal information

325
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,462
for somebody else,

326
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:30,066
things like Social Security number,

327
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:32,693
mother's maiden name, date of birth,

328
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,660
their physical-address history,

329
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,891
phone-number history, and more.

330
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:39,660
Okay, so, now they're on their way,

331
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,495
but they can't quite pass a hard-core I.D. verification.

332
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:46,462
What do they need for that?

333
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:49,132
Well, they need not fret because, on the darknet,

334
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:50,429
lots of vendors also sell

335
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,627
expertly and custom-doctored scans

336
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:56,560
of passports, I.D. cards, and utility bills.

337
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:58,924
So, with the fullz and the forged documents,

338
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,660
they stand a good chance of passing

339
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,726
a rather rigorous I.D.-verification system.

340
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:06,759
So, now they'll need a bank account to attach

341
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:10,000
to their Bitcoin-exchange service.

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,858
They can head back to the darknet markets,

343
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:15,000
and there, there are vendors that actually sell

344
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,825
pre-made bank drops just for this.

345
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:19,396
But most of the guide suggested you make

346
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,098
your own clean bank account.

347
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:25,198
That way, you control it, and you know its history.

348
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:26,824
Many different financial institutions

349
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:30,231
will allow these crooks to set up these new accounts

350
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,198
all online, all from their home,

351
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,363
and just using the same information

352
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:38,924
that they got from the fullz.

353
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:40,231
Now, when you're paying for a guide

354
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:42,000
on how to set up these bank accounts,

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,693
what you're actually typically paying for is a walk-through

356
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:48,098
on what to expect for certain banks

357
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:50,891
and what sort of challenges you'll come up against

358
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:54,429
and how best to pass them.

359
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:57,264
They'll also need a new phone number to do this.

360
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,957
So, here, the suggestion is to get a burner phone

361
00:16:59,957 --> 00:17:02,693
with exchangeable SIMs.

362
00:17:02,693 --> 00:17:05,329
And on top of that, it's often suggested

363
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,329
to not use the SIM number directly,

364
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,858
but to attach it to another phone number,

365
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:12,428
a VoiP number like Google Voice.

366
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:14,759
Now, if they don't want to go through the process of verifying

367
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,560
and setting up a Google account, the darknet markets also sell

368
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,890
pre-set-up Google Voice accounts.

369
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,924
So, they've got their exchange account set up,

370
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:28,693
and they've got their clean bank account set up.

371
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:31,330
Time to cash out some Bitcoins.

372
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,428
How do they actually get the cash out of the bank account?

373
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,231
So, here there are guides for getting the ATM card

374
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:40,264
without getting caught and how to securely get that

375
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:42,396
by avoiding cameras.

376
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:46,330
There's also guides for wiring to Western Union, MoneyGram,

377
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,297
Ria, those sort of services, using an alias.

378
00:17:51,297 --> 00:17:53,792
Or they can just keep it online, and what they can do

379
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,231
is they can set up a PayPal or Google Wallet account

380
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,495
with the identity that they've already stolen.

381
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:04,297
Those, of course, were not the only cash-out methods

382
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:06,594
that I ran into.

383
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:09,429
There are vendors who will ship you silver and gold

384
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,462
in exchange for Bitcoins,

385
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:15,396
though it's at a hefty premium, as you would imagine.

386
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,396
There are vendors who will go ahead

387
00:18:18,396 --> 00:18:19,627
and sell you a bunch --

388
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:21,033
like, I'm talking a huge stack --

389
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,428
of stolen gift cards, and it's usually at at discount.

390
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:25,891
And what you can do is turn around and sell

391
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,033
those stolen gift cards

392
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,462
to legitimate gift-card buyback services

393
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:31,956
like Gift Card Granny or Raise.com.

394
00:18:31,957 --> 00:18:34,594
That way, you're then being paid by that website.

395
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:39,627
There were cash-out techniques

396
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:41,561
for setting up two accounts

397
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,033
on freelance sites

398
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:46,924
like Fiverr, Guru,

399
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:48,231
or Upwork, something like that.

400
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:50,264
What you would do is you would set up an account

401
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:52,131
as a servicer,

402
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,561
an account as someone who needs a service.

403
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:55,792
You would act as both parties

404
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,956
and transfer the money using the website

405
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:00,462
and then get paid out through the website.

406
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:04,594
There were other methods involving setting up

407
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:06,924
bogus projects on crowdfunding websites.

408
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:08,594
Some of these crowdfunding websites,

409
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:11,231
conveniently enough, took Bitcoin directly.

410
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,231
So that made it easier.

411
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:16,825
There's also a way to cash out using things

412
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,198
like Vanilla, MoneyPak.

413
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,759
These are prepaid cards that are typically anonymous.

414
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,528
And what you can do is you can buy those from darknet vendors

415
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:28,330
that have set them up using other identities.

416
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,264
There are also some interesting methods

417
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:34,000
that involve using a gambling or bookmaker site.

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,891
What you'll do is you'll transfer your funds

419
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:37,528
into the gambling site.

420
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,726
You'll do a bit of low-risk gambling.

421
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:42,033
You might lose a little bit, but not much.

422
00:19:42,033 --> 00:19:43,396
And then after a little while,

423
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:46,528
you cash out into a different currency.

424
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:49,726
A lot of these sites will also send you a check,

425
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,924
or they'll ship you prepaid cards.

426
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:59,132
There's also some rather skeevy ways

427
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,693
that you can set up a charity.

428
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:04,297
There are even guides for getting your 501(c)(3)

429
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:08,429
to look legitimate and set up your own charity

430
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:10,429
that's connected to something like a network for good

431
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,462
or a GiveWell account.

432
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,528
That way, you can receive funds into your charity.

433
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:19,099
And they give you the guide

434
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:21,231
to actually get other people to give you money,

435
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:24,297
as well as launder your own money.

436
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:29,000
Those ones felt rather slimy.

437
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,759
There were more almost legitimate-looking guides

438
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,462
for setting up your own shell business

439
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:36,330
and then connecting it to something like Square,

440
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,297
Flint, Stripe, or Spark Pay,

441
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,462
and then funneling funds through that.

442
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:41,759
If you didn't want to go through the process

443
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,066
of setting up a whole new corporation,

444
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:45,429
there are people on the darknet

445
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,396
who will sell you an aged, off-the-shelf shell corporation.

446
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:58,627
So, all of these methods seemed rather convoluted,

447
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:00,792
and I could see different areas in them,

448
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,065
no matter what they promised,

449
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:04,594
where you could easily get popped.

450
00:21:04,594 --> 00:21:06,693
The easiest and most straightforward methods

451
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:12,396
that I saw, though, involved just using LocalBitcoins.

452
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,825
On LocalBitcoins, you can convert Bitcoins

453
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:17,891
directly into gift cards, prepaid, or reloadable cards,

454
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:20,396
postal orders, cash.

455
00:21:20,396 --> 00:21:23,264
There are also options for wire transfers, PayPal,

456
00:21:23,264 --> 00:21:25,792
Google Wallet, and Square transfers.

457
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,528
These can be done in person,

458
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:29,924
or they can be done completely online,

459
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:33,396
even the wire transfers.

460
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:37,363
Oh, and if any of these cybercriminals end up finding

461
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,297
that they need to get a custom, physical I.D. card

462
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:41,891
for any of their plans,

463
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:45,000
they actually don't need to go back to the darknet.

464
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,627
They can just get those from Reddit.

465
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:55,627
So, with all of these cash-out methods,

466
00:21:55,627 --> 00:21:56,956
there's also, as mentioned before,

467
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:59,297
the option to deal in real, tangible,

468
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:02,231
physical goods.

469
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:04,231
If you're dealing with rewards points

470
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:06,495
and e-gift cards instead of dealing

471
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:08,362
with stolen credit cards,

472
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:10,198
you don't have to worry about the charge-backs

473
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,792
or credit-card-fraud investigations.

474
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,165
You do, however, have to deal with shipping

475
00:22:15,165 --> 00:22:18,363
and finding a way to receive these goods.

476
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:20,297
Well, on the darknet markets,

477
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,000
there are shipping-label services

478
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,660
that will help you out with that.

479
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,231
There are also mini guides

480
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:27,825
on how to safely set up shipping drops.

481
00:22:27,825 --> 00:22:29,330
Many of these guides suggest not dealing

482
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,396
with actual humans as drops,

483
00:22:31,396 --> 00:22:34,264
but to seek out houses where folks are on vacation

484
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:37,296
or the house or business is recently vacated

485
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:38,528
or even how to set up

486
00:22:38,528 --> 00:22:43,000
a series of P.O. boxes using other identities.

487
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,066
There was also a lot of advice for spotting

488
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:47,462
and dealing with controlled deliveries.

489
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:48,924
Now, what a controlled delivery is --

490
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:52,197
it's when law enforcement will act as the postal carrier

491
00:22:52,198 --> 00:22:54,693
or the deliverer and will deliver the box,

492
00:22:54,693 --> 00:22:57,759
wait for you to sign it, and then slap on the cuffs.

493
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,726
So, I did run across a clever method

494
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:05,792
for straight-up bypassing all of the hassle of dealing

495
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:08,197
with these reshipping schemes.

496
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:13,099
It was a play on the old eBay triangulation fraud.

497
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,362
Here's how it works.

498
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:16,693
An e-commerce customer would place an order

499
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:19,528
with an individual offering to sell a luxury good,

500
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:22,891
typically through eBay, through Amazon.com,

501
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:25,858
through Alibaba, something like that.

502
00:23:25,858 --> 00:23:28,330
And what they would do is, the seller of the good

503
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,495
doesn't actually have the purchased item in stock.

504
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,165
They would go ahead and change the shipping address

505
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:37,726
on a hacked rewards account to the customer,

506
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,792
and then they would go into the rewards store

507
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,659
that is a legitimate rewards store,

508
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,957
and use those stolen points

509
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:45,792
to buy what the original customer ordered,

510
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,593
and then they would ship it to that customer

511
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,792
through that account.

512
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:52,000
Now, the customer actually gets what they ordered.

513
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,099
It seems legit to them.

514
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,000
But what happens when an investigation starts?

515
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,561
Who do you think becomes the main suspect?

516
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:01,131
Not the fraudulent seller.

517
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:02,396
Their information wasn't involved

518
00:24:02,396 --> 00:24:04,264
anywhere in the process.

519
00:24:04,264 --> 00:24:06,231
It's the customer that received the item

520
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:07,726
that thought it was legitimate.

521
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:11,660
They're the one that becomes the target of the investigation.

522
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,495
So, as you can see,

523
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:16,858
rewards-fraud business is booming, and it pays.

524
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:20,197
I expect we will be seeing more of these attacks in 2016

525
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:22,726
and witness another expansion of the criminal markets

526
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:25,561
for these goods.

527
00:24:25,561 --> 00:24:28,924
Going forward, I want to start expanding my scope of research

528
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:31,627
to look at forums, IRC, and Jabber.

529
00:24:31,627 --> 00:24:33,924
I also want to look at these trends over time

530
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:35,462
and start doing analysis.

531
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:39,000
This, coupled with looking at how different attacks

532
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,759
are evolving in these spaces,

533
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,231
will be very interesting

534
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,330
and will help us to be more proactive in the ways

535
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,099
in which we deal with these attackers.

536
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:49,528
I also want to look at how to actually do

537
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:53,495
a market valuation in U.S. dollars for these markets.

538
00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:55,296
With miles, vouchers, and e-gift cards,

539
00:24:55,297 --> 00:24:57,429
it's pretty easy to tell how much they're worth,

540
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,132
but rewards points don't technically have

541
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:00,264
a monetary value.

542
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:01,396
This is something

543
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:04,165
that the cybercriminals are counting on

544
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:06,495
because if it doesn't have a technical monetary value,

545
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:10,099
chances of a fraud investigation are much lower.

546
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,495
This is an interesting and ever-evolving area

547
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:17,033
that calls for much more investigation and research.

548
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:18,726
Thank you for your time, and I would like to take

549
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,792
some questions and comments from the audience.

550
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:19,792
