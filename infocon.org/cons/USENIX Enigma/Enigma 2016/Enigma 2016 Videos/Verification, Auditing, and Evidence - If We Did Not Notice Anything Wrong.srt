1
00:00:00,363 --> 00:00:08,627


2
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:12,858
-Okay, I'm going to talk
about how you might get evidence

3
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:15,330
that your election
got the right answer.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,495
And also about the other side
of that coin

5
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,594
in which you might not notice
that anything had gone wrong.

6
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:23,231
But you might not necessarily
have got the right answer.

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,957
We're gonna start
with short survey.

8
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:27,132
It goes like this --

9
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:28,528
If you have your device,

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,429
which everybody does, of course,
you can go to this URL.

11
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:34,132
Please be honest,
please give me your real name

12
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:37,693
because I'll be checking
the list off the attendee list.

13
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:40,626
And this is for science,
so please tell me the truth.

14
00:00:40,627 --> 00:00:42,594
Uh, it's --

15
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:44,462
It's a little election
about cheating.

16
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,726
And you can say
I cheated on my finals,

17
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:48,396
my taxes, my spouse,

18
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:53,066
or because this is America,
there has to be a write in.

19
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,594
So first lesson
from this little survey,

20
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:59,891
I mean election,
is first of all,

21
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:02,594
getting evidence of the right
election outcome is really easy.

22
00:01:02,594 --> 00:01:05,429
All we need to do is get
all the voters in the same room

23
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:10,066
and publish the complete list
of public names and votes,

24
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:12,297
which doesn't quite fit
on my screen for some reason.

25
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:18,000
Anyway, you get the idea
that if everybody can see

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,198
the same public list
of their inputs and everybody

27
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:23,428
can check that their own vote

28
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:25,660
is accurately represented
in the list.

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,131
And then everybody can look

30
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,396
through the entire list
of contributions

31
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:31,033
and double-check the tally.

32
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:32,891
Then, we have very good evidence

33
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:36,528
that the survey outcome, oops,
I mean election outcome,

34
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:39,330
is exactly
what the voters wanted.

35
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,726
So the aim
of end-to-end verifiability,

36
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,363
without going
into too many details

37
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:44,693
about precise definitions,

38
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:48,759
the aim is to replicate
this level of evidence

39
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,264
in a situation in which
we can't fit all of the vote --

40
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:54,033
or cannot fit all of the voters
into the one room.

41
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:56,132
And we want to base
that evidence

42
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:58,231
on maybe
some auditing assumptions,

43
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:00,198
maybe some crypto assumptions,

44
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:02,494
but not on any assumptions
about trusting

45
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,363
that individual computers
are secure,

46
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:06,495
trusting that software has done
the right thing,

47
00:02:06,495 --> 00:02:08,198
or trusting
particular individuals

48
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:10,132
with the integrity
of the result.

49
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,759
There is one other detail
that you may have picked up,

50
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:16,462
which is we'd also like
to keep the votes private.

51
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,396
So I chose
a deliberately shocking example.

52
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:21,131
But there's a serious point,
which is that even if

53
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:23,297
in California
you're pretty willing

54
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:27,329
to wear your political
affiliations on your sleeve,

55
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,231
that's not necessarily
the case for every democracy

56
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:33,692
or even for every voter
in the United States.

57
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:36,660
Even if you don't care about
your individual vote privacy,

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,033
the system has to do
a good enough job

59
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,396
of protecting privacy

60
00:02:40,396 --> 00:02:42,033
that we can be
confident everybody

61
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,197
really voted their conscience.

62
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:47,231
In fact, Josh Benaloh
pointed out very early

63
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,462
in the voting
research literature

64
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:53,000
that the privacy requirement
for voting

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,495
is actually really strong.

66
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:57,627
You shouldn't be able
to generate a proof

67
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:59,066
of how you voted

68
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:02,000
even if you're working
really hard to do so.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,594
Which is actually stronger
than just, kind of,

70
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:07,462
the passive privacy requirement
that we usually think of.

71
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:09,000
Now, I argued a few minutes ago

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,726
that end-to-end
verifiability is really easy.

73
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:13,429
But the reason
I get 20 minutes to talk

74
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:18,693
is that end-to-end verifiability
with privacy is really hard.

75
00:03:18,693 --> 00:03:21,165
And that's what the rest of
the talk is going to be about.

76
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:23,197
So privacy's important.

77
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:27,099
End-to-end verifiability
with privacy is hard.

78
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,528
I hope it's clear to this crowd
that verifiability is important.

79
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:37,858
Dana mentioned the
Volkswagen emissions scandal.

80
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:40,594
And I think it is relevant
because I think what it shows

81
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:45,099
is that asking a small number
of certification authorities

82
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,197
to keep an eye
on a small number

83
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:49,330
of very clever engineers

84
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,759
is not actually
any guarantee of integrity.

85
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,428
And if you think
of the pressures

86
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:55,693
and the incentives
on an electoral system,

87
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,825
if anything,
the amount of money involved

88
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,594
and the kind of pressure
that could be applied

89
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:04,066
is even worse
than in the automotive industry.

90
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:07,165
So any kind of evidence
about electoral integrity

91
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,429
has to come out to the public.

92
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,099
And in particular,
at the very least,

93
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,297
it has to come out
to the election observers

94
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:15,329
or the scrutineers
that that democracy

95
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,099
would usually put
in a polling place

96
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,495
or an accounting center

97
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:20,759
to watch the conduct
of the election.

98
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,297
Alex pointed out
our work showing

99
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:28,858
that the New South Wales iVote
system was not secure.

100
00:04:28,858 --> 00:04:30,561
But I've thought about it a lot.

101
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,758
And it's nearly a year
since the election now.

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,594
And what really strikes me
as the most important thing

103
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,363
is not just
that it wasn't secure,

104
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:39,561
but that it's nearly a year
since the election,

105
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,066
and we really don't have
any good evidence

106
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:45,726
about whether that vulnerability
was exploited or not.

107
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:48,264
So it's not just
that it was insecure.

108
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:50,363
It's also
that it wasn't verifiable.

109
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:53,627
So we can't even quantify
the extent of a problem,

110
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,891
even though we knew

111
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:57,825
that the vulnerability
to manipulation was there.

112
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:03,099
The officials who ran the system

113
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:05,957
have said publicly that
about 4,000 people verified.

114
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:09,561
That's a little under 2%
of the total number of votes

115
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:12,758
that came in off the system.

116
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,462
But the verification mechanism,
even if it was complete,

117
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:18,957
which I think Alex
has argued very well

118
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:21,231
it really wasn't,
even if it was complete,

119
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:24,363
its value is as an auditing kind
of mechanism.

120
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:25,891
So the total number of successes

121
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,264
isn't really
the relevant statistic.

122
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:30,825
The relevant statistic
is the rate of failure.

123
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:33,363
In other words,
what fraction of the people

124
00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:37,231
who tried to verify
failed for some reason.

125
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,594
And that statistic just hasn't
been made publicly available.

126
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:41,099
I've asked a couple of times

127
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,296
and got
kind of ambiguous answers.

128
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:45,000
So when the electoral
authorities

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,858
themselves don't really
seem to understand

130
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:51,396
what the right statistic
to report actually is,

131
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:55,099
I think that's a good indication
that all of that evidence

132
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:58,164
should be designed
into the system in a way

133
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:01,066
that it just automatically
gets sent out to the public.

134
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,066
And that's what I've described
as a crucial property

135
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:07,626
of real verifiability
in an election context.

136
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:10,198
Okay, that is the last thing
I'm going to say about iVote.

137
00:06:10,198 --> 00:06:14,792
The rest of my talk
is about iProject

138
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,032
in my home state of Victoria.

139
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,693
So let's talk about
what we'd like to try

140
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,231
and achieve out
of an electoral system.

141
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:24,396
It's important to realize
that this idea

142
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:27,462
of getting public evidence
out of secret votes

143
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:29,396
is as old as democracy.

144
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:32,363
There's really nothing
special about computers here.

145
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,462
In fact, the Australian ballot,

146
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:37,890
called a ballot
in Australia, is --

147
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:41,792
was specifically designed
and carefully engineered

148
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,330
in response
to a serious security problem.

149
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,198
There used to be
rampant voter coercion back

150
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,726
in the day
when voters had to bring

151
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:50,924
their own piece of paper
into the polling place.

152
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:53,626
And when they'd get it
from a party or a candidate

153
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:56,891
who would give them a fairly
identifiable looking one,

154
00:06:56,891 --> 00:07:00,858
people would be beaten up
on the way to the polls.

155
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:03,165
So some bright spark
in the 19th century

156
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:06,099
had the idea of engineering
a system in which the government

157
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,957
gave everybody
the same looking ballot

158
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:12,561
and they marked marks
on the same piece of paper

159
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,231
giving us both vote privacy

160
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:17,825
and the opportunity
to watch the box

161
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:20,033
into which all of the votes
were being placed,

162
00:07:20,033 --> 00:07:22,858
so that we could have a public
counting process afterwards.

163
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:25,264
Not everybody uses the
Australian ballot, the French

164
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,000
have a different system
with a glass urn

165
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,330
and little envelopes.

166
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,198
The ancient Athenians
used little bronze disks,

167
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:35,263
which they carefully dropped one
at a time into a big voting urn.

168
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,165
The bronze disks
are very subtly different,

169
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,693
but you can't tell
from a distance.

170
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,296
And of course,
here in California,

171
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:42,594
Philip Stark and Ron Rivest,
pictured here,

172
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:45,231
have pioneered the idea
of statistical audits

173
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,792
on a fraction
of the paper evidence

174
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,693
that give you some good
statistical confidence

175
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,693
without having to count
all the votes.

176
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,858
All of these systems
have the same theme

177
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:58,594
of giving a good,
public evidence trail

178
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:01,594
while keeping
individual votes private.

179
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:04,957
So how can we think about doing
that in an electronic context?

180
00:08:04,957 --> 00:08:07,792
There's actually
a great research literature

181
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:10,066
about end-to-end verifiability.

182
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:14,000
The Scantegrity system was used
in local elections in Maryland.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,561
The Helios system
is used over the Internet

184
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:18,957
for elections

185
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,330
for the International
Association

186
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,231
of Cryptologic Researchers.

187
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:25,825
And there are numerous
other systems

188
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,231
that have been designed

189
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:29,594
or deployed
in non-government elections,

190
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:32,726
some over the Internet,
and some in polling places.

191
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:37,395
Did anybody use --
Any IACR members use Helios?

192
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,626
Anybody vote in that election?

193
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:41,626
One.

194
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:43,495
Oh, no, there's a few people.
Okay, keep your hand up

195
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:45,825
if you challenged
at least one ciphertext

196
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:49,891
that you built.

197
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:51,891
One in the back. Keep your
hand up if you challenged

198
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:55,132
two or more ciphertexts
that you built.

199
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:57,726
Nobody, okay.
So we've discovered

200
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,891
that we can trust the IACR

201
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:04,791
to throw one coin
but not two per voter.

202
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:07,099
And this theme
will continue through the talk.

203
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:08,957
So Helios
is an excellent system,

204
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:11,693
but there are good reasons
that we couldn't use it

205
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:14,759
in a real government election.

206
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,165
I should also say
there's a considerable industry

207
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:20,198
of people who can print up
a pretty marketing pamphlet

208
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:22,066
claiming
that their propriety system

209
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,594
is end-to-end verifiable

210
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:26,363
but not encouraging
you or, indeed,

211
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:28,858
not allowing you to inspect
their source code,

212
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:31,396
their protocol,
or anything else

213
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:32,858
that might give you any ability

214
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,824
to assess whether or not
their claims are true.

215
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,561
I've looked at a few of them
from a distance

216
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:37,924
to the extent that I can.

217
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:39,924
And I've never seen anything
that provides anything

218
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:41,528
like the level of evidence

219
00:09:41,528 --> 00:09:43,495
that either the academic
systems provide

220
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:47,726
or that we really need
for election integrity.

221
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:52,429
So now I'm going
on to the main topic of my talk,

222
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:57,329
which is a project that we ran
in my home state of Victoria.

223
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,033
To run an end-to-end
verifiable system

224
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:07,198
in a polling place
that allowed people to vote

225
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:10,231
at a location either outside
of the state

226
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:12,264
or outside
of their normal precinct.

227
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:16,462
And in particular, the system
took nearly 1,000 votes

228
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,726
from the Australian embassy
in London.

229
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:21,297
So there's lot of ex-pat
Australians who live in London.

230
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:23,891
And they wanted to vote
in the Victorian state election.

231
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,231
And the state election
commission

232
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:27,264
didn't want to haul
a big bag of paper ballots

233
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,000
back on an airplane.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,462
So this system was designed

235
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,462
to give those voters
some evidence

236
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,593
that their votes
had been properly returned

237
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:36,957
and accurately included
in the tally,

238
00:10:36,957 --> 00:10:40,066
and also some other pre-poll
voting within the state.

239
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,858
It was organized by Craig Burton

240
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,560
at the Victorian
Electoral Commission.

241
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,561
And led out of
the University of Surrey.

242
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,099
And just to give
the physical context here,

243
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,066
here's New South Wales,

244
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:54,825
about which
Alex and I did some work

245
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:57,066
on their giant
Internet voting system.

246
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:59,066
Sydney's about here.

247
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:01,198
The project
I'm about to talk about

248
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:05,396
is here in this little
blue triangle called Victoria.

249
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:08,296
And the university of Melbourne
is right here in the center.

250
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:15,824
So just to give a bit
of cultural context, too,

251
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:17,627
I promised
that I wouldn't tell Americans

252
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,858
how to run their democracy,

253
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:24,593
but even in sensible countries

254
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:26,462
that run their elections
on the weekend,

255
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:28,429
we still have a bit
of an issue

256
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,462
about the increasing difficulty

257
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:33,231
for people to get
into a particular polling place

258
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:34,825
on polling day.

259
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:36,957
So there's a fair bit
of pressure

260
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,363
for a great deal
more flexibility

261
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:43,660
about how people access
either the polling place

262
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,957
or the process of voting.

263
00:11:45,957 --> 00:11:49,000
And about a third
of Victorians vote

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,627
before election day
one way or another.

265
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:55,065
Okay, so here's
how the system works.

266
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:58,363
It took 1,121 votes
in the state election

267
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:01,396
and, again,
in supervised polling places.

268
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:03,231
It's based on the Prêt à Voter

269
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:07,132
end-to-end-verifiable
cryptographic voting system.

270
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:09,891
And the voter comes
into the polling place,

271
00:12:09,891 --> 00:12:13,759
interacts with a computer
and takes home with them

272
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,297
an encrypted version
of their vote

273
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:17,957
that looks a bit like this.

274
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:20,759
The idea is that while they're
there in the polling place,

275
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,132
they're interacting
with the system

276
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:24,527
in a way that gives them
some good evidence

277
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:26,660
that this complicated
looking thing

278
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,495
accurately reflects the vote
they intended to cast.

279
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:32,792
Then, the encrypted votes

280
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:35,363
are posted on
the web bulletin board.

281
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:40,363
And there's some fancy crypto
involved in a clever proof

282
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:44,693
that they're accurately shuffled
and properly decrypted.

283
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:46,198
Then finally, the scrutineers

284
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,165
who are watching
the paper count,

285
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,858
and remember,
this is only a tiny fraction

286
00:12:49,858 --> 00:12:51,263
of the total votes
in the election.

287
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:53,627
The scrutineers
who are watching the paper count

288
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:56,462
can check the output
of this system and check

289
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:59,627
that that output correctly
goes into the paper count

290
00:12:59,627 --> 00:13:01,495
that they're carefully
observing.

291
00:13:01,495 --> 00:13:02,792
It's an open-source system.

292
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:04,693
GPL code is out on Bitbucket.

293
00:13:04,693 --> 00:13:06,329
And there are quite a few
academic papers

294
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,627
that describe what the protocol
is and why we think

295
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:10,891
it has the security properties
that it does.

296
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,132
I should say, by the way,

297
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:13,693
that I came to this
from a crypto background.

298
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,000
And I used to think
that this little bullet

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,462
was the most interesting part
of the whole system,

300
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:22,000
all this nifty, fancy mix nets

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,462
and zero-knowledge proofs
of decryption and so on.

302
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:26,098
And it's worth
saying 10 years later

303
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:29,264
that this part is basically
a solved problem.

304
00:13:29,264 --> 00:13:31,033
But we've subsequently realized

305
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:34,099
that all of the other bits
are really hard.

306
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:36,099
All right.

307
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:38,231
So here's a schematic diagram
of how it all works.

308
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,825
Here's Steve casting his vote.

309
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:44,330
His vote gets uploaded to
the Electoral Commission server

310
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,231
and also printed out
for him to take home.

311
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:48,825
It's the same information.

312
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:51,792
It's posted. The election
outcome is announced.

313
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,462
And then, all of these proofs

314
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:58,264
about why the election outcome
is right are posted on the web.

315
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,330
So the obvious questions
are, how do you know

316
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,528
that your vote is cast
as you intended?

317
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,495
How do you know
that your vote is properly

318
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,528
included into the tally
in the way that you cast it?

319
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:08,627
And how do you know that all
the votes are properly decrypted

320
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,132
and tallied?

321
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:13,329
Well, I'm not really going to
explain the third bullet point,

322
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,891
even though it's really cool.

323
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:18,000
But I'm going to show you,
roughly, how you check

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,726
that that encrypted,
unreadable printout

325
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:26,297
really does match the way
that you intended to vote.

326
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,495
And that's particularly tricky

327
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:29,726
since it's can't say
how you voted.

328
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:31,165
'Cause if it revealed
how you voted,

329
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:33,198
you could use it
to sell your vote.

330
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:35,495
So Prêt à Voter
uses pre-prepared,

331
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,099
paper ballot forms.

332
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,825
The crucial idea is that you get
your list of candidates,

333
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,660
but they're in a random order.

334
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,132
And everybody gets a fresh
and different random order.

335
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:48,000
Nobody else is supposed to know
what your random order is.

336
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,627
The information that defines
the order of the candidates

337
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:52,527
is also printed
on the ballot form

338
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:57,066
as ciphertext at the bottom.

339
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,099
So you vote by filling

340
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,330
in a separate piece of paper
with the numbers that match.

341
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,957
So for example, if you wanted
to vote one for green,

342
00:15:03,957 --> 00:15:05,693
you'd put a one
in the second box.

343
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,759
In most of the United States,
you're now done.

344
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,858
If you're in San Francisco --

345
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:11,627
if you're in San Francisco
or Alameda

346
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:14,462
you've got a couple
more preferences to express.

347
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:15,924
And that works fine.

348
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:18,560
If you're in Australia, you have
to fill in the whole list.

349
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:23,495
And there can be anywhere from
2 or 3 to 20 or 30 candidates

350
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:27,033
on a Victoria ballot.

351
00:15:27,033 --> 00:15:28,891
So if you're a bit paranoid,

352
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:30,726
and all of my friends
are a bit paranoid,

353
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:33,000
the first question
you would ask is,

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,396
hang on a minute,
how can I make sure

355
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:40,924
that this encrypted value
over here

356
00:15:40,924 --> 00:15:43,297
really does accurately match

357
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:47,297
this list of candidate names
that I've been told?

358
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:49,297
And the answer
is that you can audit.

359
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:52,924
So I skipped that slide,
but we can check back here.

360
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:54,231
You can, at any point,

361
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,198
challenge as many ballots
as you like.

362
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:58,363
So you can ask as soon
as you get the ballot

363
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:00,891
for this ciphertext
at the bottom

364
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,693
to be decrypted,

365
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:04,495
so that you can walk home
with some proof

366
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:08,396
that that ciphertext
matches that list of candidates.

367
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:10,660
Then, you get another ballot
and vote on that ballot

368
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,296
instead because you can't vote
on something that --

369
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,198
you cannot vote on something
that you've challenged.

370
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,924
Because if you could,
you could prove how you voted.

371
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,858
Righty oh.

372
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,627
Pardon?
Okay.

373
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:28,065
So he we go.
We're voting again.

374
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,561
Once you've filled in --

375
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,462
Once you've challenged
some ballots,

376
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:34,165
taken one that you're
happy enough to vote on,

377
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:35,924
filled in some preferences

378
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:37,726
and carefully checked
that the numbers

379
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:41,066
you wanted to cast line up
with the candidates

380
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,066
you wanted to vote for,

381
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,396
you shred the list
of candidate names

382
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:48,462
in the polling place
before you walk out.

383
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:52,561
And you take home this printout,
which is meant to be a schematic

384
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:55,297
of that complicated
looking photograph

385
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:57,066
that I showed you before.

386
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,429
And the crucial thing about this
is it doesn't reveal

387
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:01,098
how you voted

388
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:05,198
because you can't recover
the order of the candidates

389
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,924
from this thing.

390
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:11,956
Then, you go home
and check the giant list

391
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:14,528
of included votes
to look for your own.

392
00:17:14,528 --> 00:17:16,858
And if you're a real geek,
you write your own verifier

393
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:20,428
for the fancy, crypto mixing
and shuffling proofs.

394
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:26,594
So this system really
belongs in the collection

395
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,462
of carefully engineered ways

396
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,660
of generating
a genuine evidence trail

397
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,363
out of secret votes.

398
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:36,726
But there are
some important practicalities,

399
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:38,330
both for better and for worse.

400
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,462
So for better, we get evidence

401
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:46,759
of the proper transfer
of accurately recorded votes

402
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,396
as the voters intended

403
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:51,890
across the kinds of distances
or time intervals

404
00:17:51,891 --> 00:17:55,594
in which a paper evidence trail
might be really hard to justify,

405
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:57,759
or really hard to secure.

406
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,132
Many of the best systems combine
a paper evidence trail

407
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:06,396
with end-to-end
verifiable system.

408
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:08,495
But in this case,
the Electoral Commission really,

409
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,131
really didn't want
to be hauling pieces

410
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:13,000
of paper back from London.

411
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,330
So that's the positive
practical outcome.

412
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,890
The practical challenge,

413
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,330
and the reason
I've put this photo

414
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,726
of this ancient, clunky computer
from the 1960s on my slide,

415
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:30,396
is that it's still really
very clunky and hard to use.

416
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,231
And getting people
to actually do

417
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:34,429
that verification steps
is really hard.

418
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:37,759
So in particular,
I said this step

419
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,660
in which you try to verify
that the candidate list

420
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,495
you've been given really
matches your encrypted --

421
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:46,495
the encrypted description
of the same thing,

422
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,659
that's a really crucial step
in verification.

423
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,594
It turned out
that the electoral authorities

424
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:55,759
in Victoria really
didn't get that.

425
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,495
It was not intuitive
to them at all.

426
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:59,396
They implemented it.

427
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:02,594
They trained their poll workers
to respond to it.

428
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:05,132
But they didn't tell the voters
they were supposed to do it.

429
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,297
They did tell the voters

430
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:10,924
they were supposed
to check on the web

431
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:14,264
that their receipt
had been properly included.

432
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,924
And about 13% of voters
did that step.

433
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:20,561
But they didn't do
the ballot auditing step.

434
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,000
So I don't really know why.

435
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,594
I'm not really sure
why one kind of verification

436
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:27,165
seemed really natural
and intuitive

437
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,264
and the other kind
of verification didn't.

438
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:32,264
I do know that we have
to fix that bit.

439
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:34,065
We have to make sure
that every step

440
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:37,264
in the verification process
is not just the thing

441
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:38,726
they have to do
in case the crazy woman

442
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:41,231
from the university comes
and hassles them.

443
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:43,726
It has to be
a natural thing that they do

444
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:45,660
because they understand
it's a crucial part

445
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,231
of building the evidence trail.

446
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:49,924
So we haven't got that bit
quite right yet.

447
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:54,495
It's both a design problem
and an education problem.

448
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,758
So here's the big question,

449
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,528
could we do this kind
of thing securely

450
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:58,891
from home via the Internet?

451
00:19:58,891 --> 00:20:02,627
The IACR does it,
why can't everybody?

452
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:05,363
And the answer is no.

453
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:06,858
Dan said
I should just stop here.

454
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:11,528
But I feel sort of obliged to
say why, in my last 2 seconds.

455
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:13,264
I would say
that end-to-end verifiability

456
00:20:13,264 --> 00:20:15,197
is a necessary condition

457
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:18,495
for those who absolutely insist
on voting on the Internet,

458
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:21,165
but I completely agree
with both of the prior speakers

459
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:23,396
that voting over the Internet
is a really bad idea.

460
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,462
I think this project has a lot
to say

461
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:32,462
about why that is still
a long way off.

462
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:34,330
And in particular,
in addition to all

463
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,396
of the other security risks
that Alex identified,

464
00:20:37,396 --> 00:20:40,330
the difficulty of actually
getting people to verify

465
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,693
is the main practical problem

466
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:43,165
that we experienced
in that project.

467
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,924
Well, it's only going
to be worse over the Internet.

468
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:46,363
Where are people going to

469
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:48,396
get their verification
instructions from?

470
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:51,363
How are we gonna quantify
how many people actually did it?

471
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:53,957
Every thing that could go wrong
in this kind of a project

472
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:57,066
is so much harder
in a remote setting

473
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:58,924
than in a supervised setting.

474
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,792
The privacy and coercion issues,

475
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,858
the voter authentication issues

476
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:04,231
that we didn't even
have to deal with

477
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,825
because we were working
in a supervised polling place,

478
00:21:06,825 --> 00:21:10,660
remain completely unsolved
for voting over the Internet.

479
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
So this is my last slide.

480
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,825
In summary, the really important
thing about election outcomes

481
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:18,627
is public evidence
that they're correct,

482
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:21,297
and that's really hard
in the context of private votes.

483
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:24,165
Secure Internet voting
is unsolved.

484
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:27,264
And I think that instead
of saying, "We have a problem,

485
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:29,165
therefore we have to do
Internet voting."

486
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:32,132
We should be examining
the problem that we have

487
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:35,924
and thinking about how
we could make secure voting

488
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:38,429
in a polling place more flexible

489
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:42,858
without throwing out integrity
for the sake of convenience.

490
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:46,297
-All right.
Thank you very much.

491
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:45,297
