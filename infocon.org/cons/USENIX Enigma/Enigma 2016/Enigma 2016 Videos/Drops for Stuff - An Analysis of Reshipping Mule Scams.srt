1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:05,132


2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:07,923
-Thank you for the introduction.

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:12,198
I'm here to talk about reshipping mule scam.

4
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:17,198
And this is somewhat related to what you have just listened to.

5
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:21,396
And funny enough, Brian Krebs is one of the authors

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,099
of this work with me and other people.

7
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:28,693
So, I want to talk a little bit about financial data.

8
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:31,693
Cybercriminals are out to get us,

9
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:34,924
and one thing that they're really fond of

10
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:37,099
is our financial information,

11
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:40,956
usually debit-card information, credit-card information,

12
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,231
anything that can be turned into a purchase.

13
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:45,660
And they do this by,

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,660
for example, performing large-scale breaches,

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,197
those that go in the front pages of The New York Times,

16
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:54,462
like Home Depot and Target.

17
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:57,363
But there are also many, many small breaches

18
00:00:57,363 --> 00:00:58,561
that are never disclosed,

19
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:01,099
sometimes because they're not disclosed,

20
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:03,263
sometimes because they're not even detected.

21
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,891
In addition to that, there is also

22
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:09,792
a very active community of fishers

23
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:11,264
that are out on the Internet,

24
00:01:11,264 --> 00:01:14,231
try to trick users

25
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,824
into volunteering their own information,

26
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:19,891
and this is another source of this financial information.

27
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:21,594
Finally, we have malware.

28
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:25,957
There are specific families of malware whose only goal

29
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:27,857
is to sit on your computer,

30
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:31,957
wait until you go to an e-commerce site or to a bank,

31
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:34,428
and collect your personal information

32
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:35,957
and send it somewhere,

33
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:39,957
wherever the bot herder is located.

34
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:42,494
And actually, a few years ago,

35
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:46,429
me and my team captured one of these botnets.

36
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:49,297
We were able to sort of leverage a little mistake

37
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:52,527
that one of these cybercriminals made,

38
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:54,693
and we were able to control this botnet

39
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:56,594
and collect information

40
00:01:56,594 --> 00:02:00,428
that normally would be sent to the cybercriminal.

41
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:02,132
We collected more than 60 gigabyte

42
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,495
of personal information,

43
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:06,198
log-in to website, credit-card information,

44
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:07,660
banking information.

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,429
And we published a study

46
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,528
on how much could be made with all this data.

47
00:02:14,528 --> 00:02:16,462
And we found out that it was quite a bit.

48
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,363
But then, we went on and said,

49
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:21,528
"Okay, now you have this financial data in your hand.

50
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:23,033
You're a cybercriminal.

51
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:26,231
How do you turn this into real money

52
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,263
or into real goods?"

53
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,528
You need to have that,

54
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:32,297
because, otherwise, information is just information.

55
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:35,198
So, how to monetize this?

56
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:37,891
How to monetize credit-card information?

57
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,263
That's not so easy.

58
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:42,132
Once upon a time, it was easy.

59
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:45,396
You can just take the financial data, find a way

60
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:47,857
to transfer some money into a bank account,

61
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:51,396
or, for example, clone a debit card

62
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:53,857
and physically go to the ATM machine

63
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,924
and start getting cash out.

64
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:57,165
That's awesome.

65
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,231
This guy seems to be very happy.

66
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:01,066
Of course, this doesn't work for a number of reasons,

67
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:04,495
mostly because you have to be present in front of an ATM.

68
00:03:04,495 --> 00:03:08,297
And, in fact, what you see here is Albert Gonzalez,

69
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:12,231
one of the most notorious cybercriminals of this kind.

70
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:15,363
And, interestingly enough, he was responsible

71
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,891
for some of the largest financial breaches

72
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,660
in the history of the Internet,

73
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,660
but he was caught, because, around midnight,

74
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,429
he was in front of an ATM, putting one card,

75
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:31,891
another card, another card, another card, another card.

76
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:34,923
Around midnight, because at midnight,

77
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,858
they will cycle the limit for a certain card.

78
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:41,066
So he could extract twice as much the money.

79
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:44,198
It didn't help that he was wearing a female wig at the time

80
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:47,330
to avoid being recognized by the cameras.

81
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,693
And a cop noticed the suspicious guy

82
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:55,231
and apprehended him.

83
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:58,231
Another way to monetize, then, is to use money mules.

84
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:00,231
So, their way to recruit people --

85
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:03,033
So, they will go on your behalf at the ATM,

86
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:06,231
extract the money, the physical money,

87
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:08,099
and go to Western Union, for example,

88
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,297
and ship the money to the Ukraine.

89
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,825
Of course, the bank soon got into this

90
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:15,528
and are very good at identifying these type of accounts,

91
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:19,197
and they shut them down very, very fast.

92
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:22,330
Then they decided, "Okay, we cannot make cash.

93
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,858
Let's buy goods."

94
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:27,627
So the next step was, "Let's buy very expensive objects

95
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:29,495
that I can buy on Amazon,

96
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:33,759
and let's ship them," for example, "to Ukraine."

97
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,825
There is a war there. You cannot really ship weapons.

98
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:42,231
But, you know, this is a rifle infrared scope.

99
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,363
This costs around, you know,

100
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:47,792
five times more than the rifle itself.

101
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:52,857
So, it's very useful to be able to buy these goods

102
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,693
and then buy a cheap rifle somewhere else.

103
00:04:55,693 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course, merchants realized that this was

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,627
the source of a lot of fraud,

105
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,528
and decided to stop the purchase --

106
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:04,462
or the shipping, to be more precise --

107
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:06,957
of these kind of goods to the outside world.

108
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:09,033
Oops.

109
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,759
Okay.

110
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,660
Sorry, this is the wonderful Hyatt network.

111
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,561
So, of course, the idea is now, "Let's do a reshipping scam.

112
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:22,693
Let's use the same model that we used for financial data.

113
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:24,594
So, let's recruit people

114
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:27,759
and have them ship these goods for us."

115
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,792
And this is something that has been going for a while,

116
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:33,066
and, in fact, there are several documentations,

117
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,857
several warnings from the government saying,

118
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:38,396
"Please do not fall for this scam."

119
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:41,231
So, it's a known scam. So, what is our work?

120
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,792
Our work was focused

121
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:49,032
on analyzing the largest amount of real hard data

122
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:51,924
that was ever collected on this type of operation.

123
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:55,659
We stumbled upon a huge amount of information

124
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,726
that described the internals

125
00:05:57,726 --> 00:06:01,891
of how reshipping scams are carried out.

126
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:05,132
And we decided, as scientists, "Hey, let's understand this.

127
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,528
Let's measure it.

128
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:09,924
Let's see how the different actors interact with each other.

129
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:12,032
And maybe we can find a way

130
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:15,429
to actually intervene in these operations

131
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:17,726
in a way that is effective" -- sort of similar

132
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:21,858
to what Damon did with credit-card processors.

133
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:24,099
And so, what are the actors?

134
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:28,264
The actors here are, of course, the drop --

135
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:30,132
we'll see, is the person

136
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,429
that is actually asked to reship the goods --

137
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:37,164
the cardholder, a reshipping scam site,

138
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:39,363
somebody that we call the stuffer,

139
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:43,198
which is the guy who actually have to move these goods,

140
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:47,626
and the merchant that is the target of the fraud.

141
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,330
So, the first thing that happens

142
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,395
is the reshipping scam site --

143
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:54,528
the site's to publish a job ad.

144
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,033
And you have seen these ads.

145
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:59,330
It's like, "Work from home. Make a ton of money.

146
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,099
You don't have to do pretty much anything.

147
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,627
You will be one of our fantastic employees

148
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:08,693
that are able to do $4,000 working one hour a day."

149
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:11,132
And my wife, for example,

150
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:14,561
used to work at a city college, in the career center,

151
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:17,296
and she was responsible for the job ads.

152
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:22,363
She would see variations of these scams daily.

153
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:23,858
And, of course, since she's my wife,

154
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:26,000
she was able to filter them correctly,

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,462
but that's not always the case.

156
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:31,066
So, you can go on Craigslist, but also on university website

157
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:32,924
and find these type of ads.

158
00:07:32,924 --> 00:07:37,032
So, the next step is, one of the drop --

159
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:39,726
so, a person applies for the job,

160
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,957
and, you know, trying to make an extra buck.

161
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:45,033
Maybe he's a working --

162
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,528
it's somebody working multiple jobs.

163
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:52,231
And at this point, the stuffer then has stolen

164
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:54,759
the cardholder information by phishing,

165
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:58,000
by using breached data, and so forth --

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,462
contact the scam site and say,

167
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:03,627
"Hey, I need to ship some goods."

168
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,198
And say, "No problem."

169
00:08:05,198 --> 00:08:08,957
The stuffer -- so, the guy who stole the credit card --

170
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:12,231
buys something at the merchant

171
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:16,033
and, as the recipient of the shipping good,

172
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:18,198
specify the drop.

173
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,495
So, the transaction happens.

174
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:23,528
The goods are sent to the drop.

175
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:26,462
The drop actually open the box and takes pictures.

176
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,957
And these are real pictures from the data

177
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,594
that we collected on these scams.

178
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,957
These are pictures that the drop sends

179
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:35,330
to the reshipping scam site, say, "Look,

180
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,495
I really received your PlayStation --"

181
00:08:38,495 --> 00:08:40,561
I hope it's a PlayStation -- I cannot really tell --

182
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:44,363
Or "some very luxury good that I will have to reship."

183
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,594
They take the box away --

184
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:49,363
I mean, they take the good and put it in another box.

185
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:53,726
They obtain a new shipping label from the scammer site.

186
00:08:53,726 --> 00:08:57,396
Say, "Oh, please send it to somewhere in Moscow."

187
00:08:57,396 --> 00:09:00,824
They go to the USPS, and they ship the good.

188
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,660
The stuffer receives the good,

189
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,593
and then they resell the good on the black market

190
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:10,858
or even not-so-black market, as we have discovered,

191
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,263
making a profit, because, of course,

192
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:14,759
they bought the good with stolen credit cards.

193
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:19,528
So, it's very, very...

194
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,165
They can make a lot of money out of it.

195
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:26,462
So, we collected all this data through a series of sources.

196
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:30,363
Brian Krebs has some data. The FBI had some data.

197
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,132
An anonymous concerned citizen

198
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,660
dumped on us a lot of this data.

199
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,824
And of course, you know, being in academic research,

200
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:42,099
we had to do a lot of checks and balances.

201
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:43,429
I can detail that later.

202
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,627
But fundamentally, we got months and months

203
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,560
of real-world data, complete dumps of the databases

204
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:53,000
of the shipping-scam operation.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,033
We had even their message logs, their bulletin-board system,

206
00:09:58,033 --> 00:10:01,198
the discussion about setting up contracts

207
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:04,660
between stuffer and scam site.

208
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,462
And we saw a lot of logs,

209
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:09,231
a lot of actual transfer, with labels,

210
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:12,330
with full information about who was involved,

211
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,165
including their passports, Social Security numbers,

212
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:16,462
everything.

213
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:19,098
And so, we started looking at it and say, "Okay,

214
00:10:19,099 --> 00:10:21,429
the question's like, 'How do they make this work?

215
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,560
How do they split the profit?

216
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:26,132
What do they really send out?

217
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:27,396
What are the type of products?

218
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:30,329
And how do they actually ship the stuff?'"

219
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,264
Because eventually it's the U.S. Postal Service

220
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:38,297
that moves the parcels -- and --

221
00:10:38,297 --> 00:10:40,363
move the parcels from one place to another.

222
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:42,066
Sorry about that.

223
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:44,330
So, the first thing, it was pretty simple.

224
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,165
We found out there are two main models

225
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,495
of sharing profit.

226
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:49,363
If it's something really expensive,

227
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:53,165
the scam site wants a cut of it -- 50%.

228
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:55,198
If it's something not very expensive --

229
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:57,693
could be fashion or things like that --

230
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:59,132
then usually there is, you know,

231
00:10:59,132 --> 00:11:02,165
sort of a fixed fee per package.

232
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:05,429
And they just set it. It's just a normal reaction.

233
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:07,363
They know that they're doing something illegal,

234
00:11:07,363 --> 00:11:10,759
but, of course, this is not a blocker.

235
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:13,495
And these contracts have concepts

236
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:18,396
like customer-service level, customer satisfaction.

237
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,660
They promise they will monitor the performance

238
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,065
of their drops, the mule,

239
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:26,594
and make sure that they will pay back

240
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:28,363
in case somebody's misbehaving.

241
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:30,429
It's pretty sophisticated.

242
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:36,098
And what is actually exchanged in these type of scams?

243
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:38,792
Well, mostly, I would say tech.

244
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:43,594
And with technology, Apple products are very popular.

245
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:46,561
Video games, consoles, camera.

246
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:49,330
Like, lenses are very expensive,

247
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,891
and they're very small, so they're a good candidate

248
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:54,924
for this type of activity.

249
00:11:54,924 --> 00:12:00,066
Also, fashion is very important, apparently especially in Russia.

250
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:04,495
We think that in part is because of the various sanctions

251
00:12:04,495 --> 00:12:07,627
that created some kind of attrition for certain goods

252
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:11,198
and make them very appealing for these type of scams.

253
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,264
So, for example, there was a site

254
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:17,231
that was almost exclusively dedicated to Apple products.

255
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:23,726
We found another site that was more focusing...on fashion.

256
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:27,363
And as somebody from Italy, I was very moved by that.

257
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:32,528
But, in general, about 70% of the goods

258
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:35,891
goes into these two main categories.

259
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,462
So, the other interesting thing is,

260
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:42,759
how do they actually send a package

261
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,099
from one place to another?

262
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:46,693
Because there is -- the mule, the drop,

263
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:48,363
is in someplace in the United States,

264
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:49,693
receives the goods,

265
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:53,363
has to get this label to ship this thing to Russia.

266
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:55,957
And so, what they do --

267
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:59,264
Initially, they decided, "Hey, we have stolen credit cards.

268
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:02,099
Why don't we use the stolen credit cards

269
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:05,957
to buy the labels to send out the goods

270
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:08,264
that were bought with the stolen credit cards?"

271
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:09,396
Fits perfectly.

272
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:12,924
Here, these were called black labels.

273
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:15,165
They did a little bit of black-labeling,

274
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:18,495
and soon you had the post office say, "Mnh, no.

275
00:13:18,495 --> 00:13:20,033
We have to check this a little more."

276
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,198
And so these became unavailable.

277
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:25,297
Introduce white labels.

278
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:29,429
So, immediately, this crash in the black label

279
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,726
created an opportunity for the cybercriminals,

280
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:35,693
who said, "Oh, there is a new service.

281
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:36,891
We can create something

282
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:40,924
that looks like we are actually a company

283
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:46,098
that buys a lot of USPS labels and then resells them.

284
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,528
But we're gonna buy all these labels

285
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:53,132
using legitimate money -- or legitimate-looking money --

286
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,032
so it looks like we are just intermediaries

287
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,858
and we're selling labels

288
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:02,032
to people that need them at a lower price."

289
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:04,429
And the difference is that, actually, while black labels

290
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:08,198
were outrageously less expensive than USPS,

291
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,824
white labels are just a little bit less expensive

292
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:14,429
than actual USPS labels.

293
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:17,858
Another thing that is important is that a lot of the labeling

294
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,363
can depend on the type of goods that you are declaring.

295
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:22,957
And as part of the scam,

296
00:14:22,957 --> 00:14:27,726
the cybercriminal declares something slightly different

297
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:30,000
for the package than what's really inside.

298
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,198
For example, they might say that it's a used camera,

299
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,528
while instead it's a perfectly brand-new camera.

300
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,066
And so we did, actually,

301
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:42,957
an analysis on the distribution and cost of the labels.

302
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:47,627
And for sites that had high-value goods,

303
00:14:47,627 --> 00:14:51,263
where the cut was sort of like somewhat proportional,

304
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:52,957
we can see that the distribution of the label

305
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,792
tends to be more linear,

306
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:58,759
while, for others -- we'll see for the blue and black here --

307
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,462
it's more around -- you know,

308
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:03,528
it's more sort of an almost fixed price.

309
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,528
And we find out that the white labels

310
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:08,792
were around $100 per package.

311
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:12,330
So, they have a good thing going on.

312
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,033
So, we started looking at,

313
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:18,660
who is sort of like the victim in this scam?

314
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,098
Who's losing money?

315
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:24,594
And how much money is actually in this type of scam?

316
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:27,231
In terms of the victims, we look at the main victim.

317
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,198
I would say the main victim is the merchant

318
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:31,561
because, of course, they lose the goods.

319
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,858
It's very difficult to return the goods to the merchant.

320
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:37,726
And also the drop that, as we will see,

321
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:39,462
is left with no payment

322
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:43,462
and sometimes is even the victim of identity fraud.

323
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:44,891
And this is really terrible.

324
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:48,462
These people are oftentimes people in need of extra money.

325
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:53,231
They apply for this job somewhat in a state of desperation.

326
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:54,594
They never get paid,

327
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:57,594
and eventually they use the information they collected

328
00:15:57,594 --> 00:16:00,594
when they set up their job, their account,

329
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:05,363
to actually steal their information, their identity.

330
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:07,264
Sorry.

331
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:12,000
Other victims, however, are not to be left out.

332
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,957
The cardholder has to go through the hassle

333
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,429
of reverting charges and things like that.

334
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:19,329
The card issuer, of course, also is affected,

335
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,396
and the destination country of the goods,

336
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,495
because, oftentimes, certain taxes

337
00:16:23,495 --> 00:16:26,858
cannot be applied exactly because of this.

338
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:30,560
So, how big is the market?

339
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:32,462
We had so much data,

340
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:35,098
they could actually plot and interpolate

341
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:37,099
how many packages were sent.

342
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,627
And we could determine

343
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:42,891
sort of like the trend of these different websites.

344
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:46,462
And we did an analysis of how many packages

345
00:16:46,462 --> 00:16:50,231
were sent each year by interpolating the data.

346
00:16:50,231 --> 00:16:52,165
We looked at the cost of the median packages,

347
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:54,198
and we identified that each of these sites

348
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,561
was doing, more or less, $7 million of revenue per year.

349
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,759
But how big is the market?

350
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:02,264
Well, in order to understand that,

351
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:04,429
we had to understand how many cardholders

352
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:05,759
are out there.

353
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:09,594
And we did this using a capture/recapture mechanism.

354
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,099
This is something that biologists do

355
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,066
to determine a population.

356
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,231
They got a group of people. They tag -- a group of animals.

357
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:18,363
They tag them. They send them in the wild.

358
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:19,627
They get another group of animals,

359
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:22,659
and they see how much intersection

360
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,561
between these two sets there was.

361
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,428
So, we use as this two of the members of the two sites

362
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:31,627
that -- two of the sites that we had,

363
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,132
and we estimated in a conservative way

364
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:37,396
that we had 1.6 million victims,

365
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:40,462
for a total of $1.8 billion per year

366
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:44,264
for this type of scam alone.

367
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,462
We also look at how drops were recruited.

368
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,825
We found out, very interestingly --

369
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,792
and somewhat unsurprisingly,

370
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:54,561
since we had already anecdotal evidence --

371
00:17:54,561 --> 00:18:00,264
that people are hired, used, and then thrown away

372
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:03,858
exactly when they are supposed to be paid.

373
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:06,924
And we had even the messages from the forums

374
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:08,759
that say, "Hey, where's my check?"

375
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,660
And that was the last time

376
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,363
that that particular person, the particular mule,

377
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:14,924
was actually contacted.

378
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:18,165
So, people think that these scams work.

379
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:19,693
Well, they work for the cybercriminal,

380
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:21,726
but they don't work for the mules,

381
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,858
that are left without any pay.

382
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:27,956
In terms of where are the mules, well, we did an analysis.

383
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,066
We found some kind of correlation

384
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:35,429
with higher-than-normal unemployment.

385
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,759
And this is normal and expected,

386
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,825
as this type of scam actually obviously tried

387
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:43,594
to target people in need,

388
00:18:43,594 --> 00:18:47,033
people that are looking for an extra buck

389
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:50,264
because maybe our, you know, depressed economy.

390
00:18:50,264 --> 00:18:52,858
So, what are we gonna do about this?

391
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:55,197
There are several intervention approaches.

392
00:18:55,198 --> 00:18:58,957
One first round, interestingly enough,

393
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:02,231
is tracking who is tracking,

394
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:05,660
meaning that, why somebody from Russia

395
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,297
is going to the USPS tracking website,

396
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:10,660
do reload, reload, reload, reload

397
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
to find out where the package has been moved

398
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,693
at this point in time.

399
00:19:14,693 --> 00:19:17,858
And if we can identify, use patterns

400
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,956
of who's accessing this information,

401
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:22,330
in order to identify an anomalous situation,

402
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,099
we can at least track the package

403
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:28,033
even before it is reshipped.

404
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,428
Another thing that we can do

405
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,594
is to do analysis of the shipping labels --

406
00:19:32,594 --> 00:19:35,561
why a certain account from one guy

407
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:39,330
is used to pay for shipping

408
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,924
that goes from many different guys

409
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,759
to the same guy in Russia?

410
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,363
There are many patterns

411
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:49,495
that can show that this is actually fraudulent.

412
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:51,824
And, finally, we can use destination

413
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,462
as a target for this.

414
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:54,858
And our analysis show that

415
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:59,726
the vast majority of the packages go to Moscow.

416
00:19:59,726 --> 00:20:03,099
Of course, this is not a single signal that can be used,

417
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:08,495
but it's obvious that, you know, 85% of the goods

418
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:11,362
that are shipped with this scam are out there.

419
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:15,297
So, what are our conclusions?

420
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,858
This is a big scam,

421
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:20,131
and that's why, for example, the FBI was interested

422
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,561
in collaborating with us

423
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:26,066
in trying to map and understand how this was carried out.

424
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,792
But we need something new.

425
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,561
We need a new way

426
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,792
to use network information and graphs

427
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:37,726
that represent how the different actors

428
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:40,726
and objects being shipped interact with each other

429
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:44,165
in order to be able to do an effective job

430
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:45,956
at stopping this type of scam.

431
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:49,462
Unfortunately, this information is spread

432
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:51,396
is so many different places.

433
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:54,165
There is the United States Postal Service.

434
00:20:54,165 --> 00:20:55,693
There is the FBI.

435
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:57,594
There are, you know, the IRS.

436
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:59,759
There are the credit-card processors.

437
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,198
There's the prepaid-card processors.

438
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:03,165
There are the merchants.

439
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:05,428
And it is very difficult

440
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,726
to have all these people work together

441
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,693
in order to identify, in a clear way,

442
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:13,462
who are the cybercriminals in action.

443
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:14,726
This is not just my work.

444
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:16,594
It's work with many people,

445
00:21:16,594 --> 00:21:20,462
including Mike Eubanks from the FBI

446
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:24,165
and Brian Krebs, who provided us with some of the data.

447
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:27,495
And with this, I'm ready for some questions.

448
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,462
[ Applause ]

449
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:28,462
