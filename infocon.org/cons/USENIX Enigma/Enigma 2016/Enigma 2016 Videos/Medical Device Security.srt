1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:06,891


2
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:08,066
-All right, good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,099
Great to be here.

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,363
So, we'll get right into it.

5
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:13,495
I can see questions are brewing.

6
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:15,329
So, I'm gonna try to introduce to you

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,363
some of the interesting security challenges in the medical space,

8
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:22,528
but particularly to medical devices.

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,759
These are devices that treat patients, diagnose patients.

10
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:30,066
They are some of the most extreme devices I've seen.

11
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,066
And I'd like to draw a little parallel --

12
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:35,165
I'm a history buff and a classicist at heart.

13
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:36,924
I'm not gonna go back to B.C.,

14
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:40,561
but I'd like to draw some parallels to the 1800s.

15
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:44,231
There's a very interesting piece of medical research

16
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,660
that happened in the 1840s by a number of physicians,

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,791
including one Ignaz Semmelweis.

18
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,066
He discovered that his students

19
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,000
who were working in the morgue in the morning

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,132
and then later went to go work with patients --

21
00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:59,693
well, those patients tended to have a higher morality rate

22
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:00,957
for some reason.

23
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:03,033
And so he did a control study,

24
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,263
and he discovered, "You know what?

25
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,527
If you wash your hands after doing that,

26
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:09,033
your patients tended to live."

27
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:11,396
So, the reaction from the physician community was,

28
00:01:11,396 --> 00:01:12,594
"Well, doctors are gentlemen,

29
00:01:12,594 --> 00:01:14,890
and therefore their hands are always clean" --

30
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,594
sort of complete denial

31
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:19,627
even in the face of the statistics.

32
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:23,033
And so, there were actually some real reasons for that denial.

33
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:25,132
And even today we have trouble with handwashing

34
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:26,363
and sterile technique.

35
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:29,693
Infection is still a leading hazard

36
00:01:29,693 --> 00:01:31,231
in our clinical facilities,

37
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:34,033
and I'll try to explain why using this example.

38
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:37,000
I usually pass around one of my defibrillators

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,594
from my defibrillator collection.

40
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:40,494
This is a defibrillator -- I'm not gonna do that today,

41
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:42,165
just 'cause there's too many people.

42
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,660
Up here, I have a picture of a pacemaker,

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,693
which is very similar to a defibrillator.

44
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,462
It allows you to have a faster heart rate.

45
00:01:50,462 --> 00:01:52,231
This is an electrode that is woven

46
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,000
through a sacrificed blood vessel.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,693
This one hasn't yet been used.

48
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:59,792
And it is used for both sensing cardiac arrhythmia,

49
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:02,429
as well as delivering lifesaving shocks.

50
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:05,330
So, this is a picture from my colleagues at Medtronic

51
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,066
of one of their early devices,

52
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:10,429
before they had wireless control of the implant.

53
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,000
And there was actually a very good reason

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,330
to have wireless control.

55
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,165
But this was one without wireless.

56
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:18,528
So, if you take a look at that little metal wire

57
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:21,560
coming out the right-hand side, you might wonder what that is.

58
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,759
That's technically

59
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,594
what you would use to program the device.

60
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:28,033
So, in the days before wireless control,

61
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,396
the physician would ask the patient,

62
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:30,462
"Please lift up your arm,"

63
00:02:30,462 --> 00:02:31,825
plunge a needle through the armpit,

64
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:34,792
twist a dial to change your heart rate.

65
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:37,066
So, as you can imagine, this had the "ick" factor,

66
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:40,264
but it also had the problem of infection control.

67
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:41,561
Infection was a real risk.

68
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,924
It's not something you think about

69
00:02:42,924 --> 00:02:44,825
unless you're in one of those university laboratories

70
00:02:44,825 --> 00:02:46,759
typing on keyboards.

71
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,759
But infection is a real issue.

72
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,099
And so that is why you see

73
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:53,329
wireless communication entering medical devices.

74
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,330
It's there for a real good reason --

75
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,231
to reduce the risk of infection.

76
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,165
The story you won't hear too much,

77
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:01,528
but if you talk with some of the engineers

78
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:03,462
who worked on these devices, some of the things

79
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:04,429
that used to happen

80
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:07,033
back in the days of the old dial --

81
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:09,560
well, you might have an elderly couple

82
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:11,693
with some late-night activities,

83
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:13,528
and they need to elevate their heart rate for something,

84
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:14,957
so they'd just find any object they could

85
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:17,692
and try to get their heart rate up.

86
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:19,231
And so, for these kinds of reasons,

87
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,363
you would get infections.

88
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:24,627
So, today these implants are largely wirelessly controlled,

89
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:27,726
not in the sense of your consumer 802.11 wireless,

90
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:30,957
but typically some kind of proprietary wireless system.

91
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:33,329
And I'll just give you an example.

92
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,792
I'm not gonna talk too much about research,

93
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,528
but here's some research I participated in

94
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:38,197
about eight years ago,

95
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,231
where we were able to induce ventricular fibrillation

96
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:45,957
wirelessly into -- using a defibrillator.

97
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,231
So, there's this little wand

98
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,263
that's used to program the device,

99
00:03:49,264 --> 00:03:50,792
and the device is implanted.

100
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:52,198
It only takes about 90 minutes.

101
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,231
It's a relatively routine procedure.

102
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:55,561
The patient is awake,

103
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:58,561
slightly sedated with a local anesthetic.

104
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:01,825
After the device is implanted, it's sewn up, it's tested.

105
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,099
The patient goes home,

106
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,792
and typically they have some kind of --

107
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:07,693
what looks like a base station sits at your bedside.

108
00:04:07,693 --> 00:04:09,726
It collects what's called your telemetry

109
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:12,825
from your implanted device, sends it up to the clinician

110
00:04:12,825 --> 00:04:15,923
so the clinicians can look over an HTTPS website --

111
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,165
"How are you doing?" --

112
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:18,660
in case you need to be brought in early,

113
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,759
in case something unexpected is going on.

114
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,726
These devices save lives. Don't get me wrong.

115
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:25,759
These devices are very important.

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,561
However -- and this was a device that's no longer manufactured.

117
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,858
But what we found -- A number of years ago,

118
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:35,231
I handed to a team of students and colleagues

119
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,099
a defibrillator and an oscilloscope.

120
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,726
And by eavesdropping on the radio communication

121
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,495
between an implant and a programmer,

122
00:04:41,495 --> 00:04:43,000
they were basically able to pull out

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,858
the entire electronic health record,

124
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:48,693
unable to find any kind of evidence of encryption going on.

125
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:52,164
They also did what was called a replay attack,

126
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:53,924
where they recorded certain commands

127
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:55,924
to disable all the wireless therapies.

128
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:59,659
And they also replayed a command to induce a fatal heart rhythm.

129
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,726
It turns out, built into many devices

130
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:04,924
is a debugging command -- for good reason --

131
00:05:04,924 --> 00:05:06,890
to induce a fatal heart rhythm.

132
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,561
And the reason for that is,

133
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,132
how do you test if a defibrillator's

134
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,660
working properly in a patient

135
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,429
if they have a normal heart rhythm?

136
00:05:13,429 --> 00:05:15,659
So, built into the device is a little command

137
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,561
to induce a fatal heart rhythm

138
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:19,890
such that you can see if the device recognizes it

139
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:21,726
and brings them back.

140
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:25,000
Luckily, these devices are no longer manufactured --

141
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,099
at least, the ones we looked at --

142
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,033
but there's still a long way to go.

143
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,660
I do want to emphasize, though,

144
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,198
that patients are just far better off

145
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,561
with these devices than without.

146
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,924
I'm not gonna everybody saying that the sky is falling

147
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:39,957
or that we should be running for the hills.

148
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,759
If I were prescribed one of these devices today,

149
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,396
I would take it in a heartbeat, literally.

150
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:47,693
And, you know, security, in my view, is still --

151
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,032
Even though I'm a security researcher,

152
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:52,924
I consider it sort of a secondary fact after safety.

153
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:56,000
So, where are we in terms of security in medical devices?

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,627
There's so many examples I could point to,

155
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:00,363
so I'll just point to one of the more recent ones.

156
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:04,429
Billy Rios is a very talented security researcher,

157
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:06,857
former Marine -- or technically, you're never a former Marine.

158
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,429
You're always a Marine.

159
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:11,561
And he took a look at one infusion pump,

160
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:12,890
and it took over a year

161
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,759
for the manufacturer to get back to him.

162
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,231
But he found some very interesting problems.

163
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,594
Is anyone in the audience sort of like a red-teamer

164
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,330
or does any kind of security investigation, forensics?

165
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,330
Okay.

166
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,264
So, I'd be curious to get your take.

167
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:27,924
So, there wasn't a recall, but --

168
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:32,032
And FDA very rarely issues a recall,

169
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,858
but they issued what's called a product advisory,

170
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:36,363
basically saying, "Stop buying these devices.

171
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,594
Try to find something else

172
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:40,891
to infuse drugs into your patients."

173
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:43,462
And the reason why is, Billy found that,

174
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:47,659
"Well, if you telnet to port 23, you get a root shell."

175
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,297
Okay, so, we don't know

176
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:53,165
if there's any technology sold on the market

177
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:54,528
that can solve this.

178
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,957
Oh, there are these hard-coded local accounts.

179
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,033
Oh, and by the way,

180
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,726
if you do use the wireless network,

181
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:02,858
the keys are stored unencrypted, accessible via Telnet and FTP."

182
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:05,957
By the way, those are the passwords, down at the right.

183
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:07,759
So, most of the time,

184
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,891
what we find in medical devices is not anything advanced.

185
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:13,165
It's more like breaking down an open door.

186
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,033
And some manufacturers

187
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,792
are better than others at responding.

188
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,099
And I'll tell you more about infusion pumps

189
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,000
a little later in the talk.

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,627
But most of it boils down to poor hygiene

191
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:27,297
or just not understanding some of the ramifications

192
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:31,792
of security choices made in early design.

193
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:33,659
If you want to find malware, go to a hospital.

194
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,132
It's a very unique environment.

195
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,297
A colleague of mine once gave me a picture

196
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:39,858
of his network architecture,

197
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:43,462
and the architecture's not too interesting and not too unique,

198
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:44,792
but what is interesting

199
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,924
is the breakdown of operating systems.

200
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,693
And so if you squint and look carefully,

201
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,561
you can see that they have 664

202
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:53,198
sort of traditional operating systems

203
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:54,495
on their medical devices.

204
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:59,858
These are things like MRIs, radiology machines,

205
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:02,033
all sorts of different kinds of devices,

206
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:03,429
typically with a monitor.

207
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,395
And you'll notice there's a little line there

208
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:08,891
of 600 Windows XP machines in this hospital.

209
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:10,165
And, by the way,

210
00:08:10,165 --> 00:08:13,891
that's 600 version Service Pack 0 XP machines --

211
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:17,858
not a patch ever, since the birth of Windows XP,

212
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:20,000
because they had difficulty getting patches

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,462
from the manufacturer.

214
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:23,000
So, what you'll find in hospitals

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,396
is a whole bunch of legacy equipment.

216
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:26,891
By the way, the Windows 95 is what they call the magnet.

217
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:28,231
That's the MRI.

218
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,759
If they want to upgrade to a newer operating system,

219
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,627
I'm told they have to buy a new magnet,

220
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,593
which costs several million dollars.

221
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,792
So, this is why you're gonna see a lot of old operating systems.

222
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,594
These capital costs

223
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:44,033
are very difficult to just suddenly throw away.

224
00:08:44,033 --> 00:08:45,891
By the way, it takes about 12 days to get infected

225
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:50,791
when they have no kind of mitigating controls in place,

226
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,033
although when they have some kind of mitigating control,

227
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,066
like antivirus or firewalls,

228
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,132
it tends to get them up to nearly a year

229
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:59,363
before the device gets infected.

230
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:03,561
So, what about on the manufacturing side?

231
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,462
There's some interesting stories

232
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,627
that I've begun to collect on security problems

233
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,231
at factory installation.

234
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:14,198
The picture up here is one of a ventilator for breathing.

235
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:16,165
It's a very common device in a facility.

236
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:18,296
If you need it, I highly recommend you use it.

237
00:09:18,297 --> 00:09:20,594
Don't deny it.

238
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:23,396
But I noticed that there was an FDA recall on this device.

239
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,957
And so, you know, like any good security researcher,

240
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:27,825
I just like to download executables on the Internet

241
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,462
and run them and see what happens.

242
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:31,627
So, I found their website.

243
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:32,824
I clicked on the little link that said,

244
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:35,132
"Download your ventilator firmware update."

245
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:36,957
I thought, "So cool."

246
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:38,264
I clicked on it,

247
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:40,231
and I think I know the guy in the room

248
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,363
who can answer what this is.

249
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:46,297
This little dialogue box popped up from Chrome.

250
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:49,561
It said, "Warning: Visiting this site may harm your computer.

251
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,759
This website you are visiting appears to contain malware."

252
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,264
Right? So, many of you know what this is.

253
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:58,792
Those of you who don't, go ask one of the people who do.

254
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:03,462
But, basically, this poor manufacturer got attacked,

255
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:05,858
and they were distributing a little malware bonus package

256
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:08,726
along with their medical-device firmware update.

257
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:12,462
So, good old Niels over at Google, of course,

258
00:10:12,462 --> 00:10:15,066
was very involved with the safe-web-browsing service.

259
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:18,099
And so you can go and investigate why Google thinks

260
00:10:18,099 --> 00:10:20,429
that this particular manufacturer

261
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:21,560
was distributing malware.

262
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:24,792
And according to Google, there were 19 pages

263
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,462
resulting in this malicious software,

264
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:30,462
with 38 Trojans and 3 scripting exploits --

265
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,858
a bonus package.

266
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:34,560
Now, what's interesting to me is that the type of person

267
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:36,462
who downloads this update is not me.

268
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:38,759
The type of person who downloads a ventilator firmware update

269
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,099
is a biomedical engineer or a clinical engineer.

270
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,429
These are not security experts, nor should they be.

271
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:46,593
And what I want to know is, do they click "continue,"

272
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:47,924
or ignore it, you know?

273
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:51,033
So, chances are, they needed to get their job done,

274
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,924
they needed to get that firmware out there,

275
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:57,033
and they probably have infected their local computer as result.

276
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,561
There are plenty of other ways that malware

277
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:02,396
gets into the supply chain of the healthcare industry.

278
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,527
An interesting one was at the V.A.,

279
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:05,825
where there was a contractor

280
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,066
who was doing software updates and software maintenance

281
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,429
and accidentally brought in malware with a USB stick

282
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:15,726
as the vendor himself was doing updates of the medical devices.

283
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:18,033
There was another case of a vendor

284
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,528
of what's called a compounder.

285
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,660
If you're from New England, you might have heard of

286
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,791
the meningitis outbreak

287
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,726
with the New England Compounding company.

288
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:27,132
But compounders make custom drugs for I.V. delivery.

289
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:30,132
And, well, one happens to run Windows XP,

290
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:33,396
and it got infected with a virus.

291
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:35,032
And the more interesting part,

292
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:36,330
at least according to an engineer

293
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,231
that used to work there, was -- He told me, "Well,

294
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,594
that was only half the story.

295
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,231
Yeah, the device got infected,

296
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:43,462
but then when the device was under repair,

297
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:45,330
it was accidentally spread

298
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,561
to the other compounders under repair."

299
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:48,957
So, it's sort of a Typhoid Mary

300
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,957
of the medical-device-security world.

301
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,891
So, just to give you an idea of just sort of --

302
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,264
This is low-hanging fruit.

303
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:01,429
This is not some sinister hacker necessarily.

304
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,033
But let me just give you a snapshot

305
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:06,429
of the last five days of medical-device security.

306
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:09,495
So, a week ago, FDA issued some new regulatory guidance

307
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,330
on what they expect for responsible disclosure --

308
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,000
coordinated disclosure, rather, for medical-device security

309
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,528
and looking for these problems.

310
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,759
But let me tell you what happened

311
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,495
within the four days after that.

312
00:12:21,495 --> 00:12:24,363
A hospital in Australia was attacked.

313
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:27,627
A virus got into their Windows XP computers

314
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,165
in their pathology department,

315
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,759
and now they are doing manual processing of specimens

316
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,726
of blood, tissue, and urine samples

317
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:35,759
because their computer systems are still down.

318
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,231
That was on Monday.

319
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,858
Tuesday, apparently nothing happened.

320
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,560
But on Wednesday -- oh, those happy days --

321
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,132
a hospital in Texas

322
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:48,000
experienced the wonderful CryptoLocker virus,

323
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,627
and they're now struggling

324
00:12:49,627 --> 00:12:51,329
with getting their systems back online.

325
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,759
That was on Wednesday.

326
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,627
On Thursday, the same manufacturer

327
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:57,627
of the pump I just showed you had a new product advisory.

328
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:59,791
The CERT ICS announced

329
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,033
that there is a buffer overflow vulnerability

330
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:05,858
that is remotely accessible by port 5000.

331
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:09,032
And they said the difficulty of this was low-skill --

332
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,627
in other words, breaking down an open door.

333
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:13,693
Oh, and then, don't forget Friday.

334
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,924
On Friday, in my home state of Michigan,

335
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:19,066
a hospital in Flint confirmed that there was a cyber attack

336
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,594
on their medical systems.

337
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:22,330
They haven't given much more details,

338
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,594
but there were hacktivists protesting

339
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:28,099
some of the lead-water problems we're having up in Flint.

340
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,231
So, there's one week

341
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,231
in the world of medical-device security.

342
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:38,957
Okay, so, if Ignaz Semmelweis were alive today and were,

343
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:41,792
instead of talking about the importance of handwashing,

344
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:45,231
if he were instead talking about medical devices and security,

345
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:47,330
he'd probably be saying something like,

346
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,891
"Medical devices should be secure,"

347
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:51,065
and "Doctors are gentlemen --" or gentlewomen --

348
00:13:51,066 --> 00:13:52,792
"and therefore their computers are always secure."

349
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,132
But they were very sexist.

350
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:58,098
The interesting part is,

351
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:02,429
the denial is very, very similar to the denial in the 1800s.

352
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:05,560
So, thank goodness we have plumbing, okay?

353
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,198
I'll tell you, the P-trap for the plumbing

354
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:08,824
was invented in the early 1840s.

355
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:11,495
Before that, we had sewer-gas problems all over the place.

356
00:14:11,495 --> 00:14:14,528
I mean, it's almost like living in San Francisco.

357
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:18,000
But -- Oh, sorry. Was that too close to home?

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,066
[ Chuckles ]

359
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,363
Well, it's the Super Bowl, right?

360
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:21,693
What kind of bowl?

361
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,957
So, the -- Anyhow, you can imagine asking a physician

362
00:14:25,957 --> 00:14:27,825
to wash their hands in the 1840s,

363
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,396
when not every hospital had running water.

364
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:32,132
It's very similar to today, when you ask someone,

365
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:33,132
"Just put security on it."

366
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:35,000
There is no silver bullet.

367
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,165
In fact, I would argue there's a lot more snake oil out there

368
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,627
than stuff that actually works.

369
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:41,263
"Just slap a firewall on there."

370
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:43,825
Yeah, that'll help reduce your risks,

371
00:14:43,825 --> 00:14:45,297
but it's no panacea.

372
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,660
The malware just gets in by USB drive

373
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,165
or social engineering over the telephone.

374
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:52,363
So, we're gonna have a long way to go.

375
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,528
It's taken over 160 years for handwashing.

376
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,825
I don't expect the medical-device-security problem

377
00:14:56,825 --> 00:14:58,957
to be solved in just 10 years.

378
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:00,264
But what we do know --

379
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:02,561
the tried-and-true method to get good security is

380
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:05,330
security needs to be designed in from the very beginning,

381
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,561
not bolted on.

382
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,462
And I'm comforted to know --

383
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:10,660
I work quite a bit with manufacturers now.

384
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,791
And I'm very comforted to know that they are actually

385
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:16,594
doing security engineering at the whiteboard stage

386
00:15:16,594 --> 00:15:17,891
before they've written a line of code,

387
00:15:17,891 --> 00:15:19,726
before they've written one requirement.

388
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:21,825
They're already thinking about security.

389
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:22,924
The problem, of course,

390
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:24,396
is you have these product life cycles,

391
00:15:24,396 --> 00:15:25,924
and it will be some number of years

392
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,759
before you start to see the outcomes

393
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,462
of this good security engineering.

394
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,330
But bolting it on after the fact

395
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,924
is not going to be a long-term solution.

396
00:15:33,924 --> 00:15:35,560
I will just show you one thing.

397
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,363
I am the Chief Scientist at Virta Laboratories,

398
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:39,627
a start-up company.

399
00:15:39,627 --> 00:15:41,693
But one of the interesting things we're doing --

400
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:42,824
We've noticed

401
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:47,792
just how difficult a time hospitals have had

402
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,231
putting security approaches onto their medical devices,

403
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,957
'cause these are very difficult devices to modify.

404
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:55,198
So, instead, we built a power outlet.

405
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:57,132
And what's interesting about this power outlet

406
00:15:57,132 --> 00:15:59,495
is it analyzes your power-consumption patterns

407
00:15:59,495 --> 00:16:02,396
to determine whether or not you're infected with malware

408
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,791
or other types of anomalies.

409
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,495
So, it's sort of like a thermometer

410
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:11,561
for weird things that go on on embedded computer systems,

411
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,132
to help you detect problems before you spread them.

412
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:15,858
Apparently, like, the average time

413
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,957
to detecting an infection is something like 209 days.

414
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:21,627
I think it's got down to 209 days on median.

415
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:23,065
We'd like to see that a little bit lower,

416
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,759
maybe at least 200.

417
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,099
But it's interesting to be able to catch some kinds of malware

418
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:32,891
just through the power outlet in just a few seconds.

419
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,462
So, toward the future, you're gonna hear in the media,

420
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:38,066
you know, it's --

421
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,297
You know, the most interesting thing

422
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,759
is always the hackers' side.

423
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,198
So you're gonna see a lot of media

424
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:44,561
focusing on hackers breaking into medical devices.

425
00:16:44,561 --> 00:16:47,825
I'm not saying that's untrue. It is true that hackers do that.

426
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:50,264
But if you were to ask me the question,

427
00:16:50,264 --> 00:16:52,396
like, "What's the biggest risk?"

428
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:54,462
I'm actually more concerned with more basic stuff,

429
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,066
akin to handwashing.

430
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:58,198
These are not things with malicious intent

431
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,693
against medical devices,

432
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:01,726
but it's about wide-scale unavailability

433
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:03,264
to deliver patient care.

434
00:17:03,264 --> 00:17:07,297
If your cath lab gets infected by a common, just garden-variety

435
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,297
piece of malware, you can't deliver care.

436
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:11,198
You can't give that angioplasty.

437
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:13,660
You tell your patients to be transported to another hospital

438
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,495
for their critical cardiac conditions.

439
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,758
When your medical devices

440
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,726
that are doing diagnostics get infected by malware,

441
00:17:20,726 --> 00:17:23,627
they start changing subtle things, like interrupt patterns.

442
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:25,098
You start to miss interrupts.

443
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:28,197
The software is not designed to behave

444
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:30,231
when malware is running on the computer.

445
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:31,231
And so the integrity

446
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:32,924
of those medical sensors are compromised,

447
00:17:32,924 --> 00:17:35,429
and you no longer can have a good confidence

448
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,726
in the diagnostics coming from those devices.

449
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:41,066
I encourage people, both professionals in the industry

450
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,396
as well as students,

451
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,594
to look at medical-device security as an area for work.

452
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:46,528
It needs your help.

453
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:48,066
But the important thing is,

454
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:51,693
do not interrupt clinical work flow.

455
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,132
I have seen so many armchair solutions --

456
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:55,924
you know, "just slap a password on it,"

457
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:58,561
"just do this," "just do this thing we use in I.T."

458
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,428
You know, the last thing you want is a pacemaker

459
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,594
that locks you out after three attempts of a password,

460
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:04,957
I'll tell you, okay?

461
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:07,132
So, don't interrupt clinical work flow.

462
00:18:07,132 --> 00:18:10,924
Don't expect the clinician community to change for you.

463
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,363
Whatever you do, it needs to be seamless.

464
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:14,825
It needs to just fit in

465
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:18,198
so they don't need to change the way they work with patients.

466
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,000
And the problem is, many of the best security specialists

467
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,528
out there are more focused

468
00:18:22,528 --> 00:18:24,132
on what I could call technical controls --

469
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:27,429
deploy this technology, install this, configure that,

470
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:30,528
disable this, don't allow that kind of behavior --

471
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:31,825
whereas what you'll find in hospitals

472
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,132
are safety specialists,

473
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:35,165
who focus on what's called risk management.

474
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,561
They accept risk

475
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:39,924
because patients are already predisposed to risk.

476
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:42,363
Therefore, they may actually choose

477
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:44,330
not to implement a security solution

478
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,792
because it might mean they can keep the patient safer

479
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,528
or the work flow will be preserved.

480
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:51,000
So, it's not always the case that you'll deploy security.

481
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Sometimes you actually accept the risk.

482
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,957
But trustworthy medical-device software

483
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:59,033
requires both of these -- safety and security.

484
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,824
And I think you'll find that there are technologies

485
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:01,858
that give you both.

486
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:03,627
Classic stuff like static analysis

487
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:04,726
will help you with both.

488
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,792
There are plenty of other examples.

489
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,759
But I think I'll just end with --

490
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,528
medical-device security is in its very early stages.

491
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,429
I've been working in it for about 10 years now.

492
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:18,891
But I think you'll be seeing -- We're currently in a phase

493
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,000
of sort of the breaking down open doors,

494
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,792
but I'm actually optimistic

495
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:25,528
because what I'm seeing at some of the better manufacturers

496
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:29,000
are serious, honest attempts

497
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,726
at bringing better security engineering into these products.

498
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:34,000
If you'd like to learn more, I've got a website up there

499
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,792
with sort of a blog of all sorts of other interesting examples.

500
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,792
But I think I'll end there to take any questions,

501
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:43,131
and I hope you appreciate some of the complexities now

502
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:44,495
of medical-device security

503
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:47,693
and why it's not as simple as just doing a software update.

504
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:48,792
Thank you.

505
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:47,792
