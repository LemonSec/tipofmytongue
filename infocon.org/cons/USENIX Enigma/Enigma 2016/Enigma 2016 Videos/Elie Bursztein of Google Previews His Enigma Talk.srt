This year at Enigma, we plan to do a talk

6
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:17,264
on the lessons we learned while protecting Gmail

7
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:19,462
and try to give to the audience a glimpse

8
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:21,891
of what works and what doesn't work.

We've been known to protect very efficiently the user

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,198
against spam, phishing, and malware.

11
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:30,231
We try to explain really, in a crisp manner,

12
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:33,066
what all the things we do for each of those type of attacks

13
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,132
and how we combine things

14
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:38,561
from machinering to dynamic execution

15
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:39,924
to all of those techniques

16
00:00:39,924 --> 00:00:44,198
to really make Gmail the safest place we can.
