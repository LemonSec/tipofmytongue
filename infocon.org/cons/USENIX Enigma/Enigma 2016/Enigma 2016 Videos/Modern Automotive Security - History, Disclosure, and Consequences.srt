1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:00,495


2
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:03,495
♪♪

3
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,132
-Thank you very much.

4
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:14,132
So, I'm gonna talk mainly about cars today.

5
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:16,924
And just to recap, for the few of you

6
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:19,165
who weren't in Yoshi's talk,

7
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:22,494
here's the context.

8
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:25,462
A modern, unmodified vehicle --

9
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:28,792
Oh, we're not getting sound.

10
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:30,561
Why are we not getting sound?

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,197
All right.

12
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:39,429
Let me do this one more time... with sound.

13
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:41,099
All right. You're not gonna see sound.

14
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:42,461
So this is a demo

15
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:45,561
that we did for DARPA and "60 Minutes"

16
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:50,000
with Leslie Stahl where we remotely turned off her brakes

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,891
as she tried to drive this course.

18
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:56,759
And she is saying, "Ahh!"

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,198
or something akin to that.

20
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:00,528
"That's really scary."

21
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:04,891
And so this was an off-the-shelf, unmodified sedan,

22
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:08,693
and it is not unique to this car, all right?

23
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,363
And so I am not gonna tell you how to do that,

24
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:12,759
although I'm sure there are many of you

25
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,957
who would like to learn that, and that's why you came,

26
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:16,330
and unfortunately I'm here to disappoint you.

27
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,923
I'm gonna talk about why we can do that.

28
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:23,297
Why do these vulnerabilities exist in automobiles?

29
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:25,527
And what are the challenges in addressing them?

30
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:26,924
Why is this not as simple

31
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:29,198
as, "Hey, hire better people, automotive industry,

32
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:30,461
and then it'll all be better."

33
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:31,726
And then I'll talk a little bit

34
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:34,198
about what role does the research community play

35
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:35,890
and the different roles that it's played

36
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:37,231
in trying to deal with this problem

37
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,824
and some of the trade-offs in how it does this.

38
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:41,462
To get us all on the same page, though, I'm gonna talk

39
00:01:41,462 --> 00:01:44,264
a little bit about the technology

40
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:46,527
so that we'll understand as we get into some

41
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:48,330
of these points, the "why"s.

42
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,858
And so the first thing I want to disabuse you of

43
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:53,396
is that a car is a mechanical device.

44
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,396
All right?

45
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:56,033
A car is a big distributed system

46
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,297
that has wheels connected to it.

47
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:01,330
And that has been true for really about 15 years,

48
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,000
but today, it's super true.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,198
So it is probably the most complex distributed system

50
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:09,132
that you personally own.

51
00:02:09,132 --> 00:02:11,594
If you have bought a car in the last 5 or 10 years,

52
00:02:11,594 --> 00:02:13,759
there are gonna be 20 or 40 different computers.

53
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,528
The term of art is Electronic Control Unit or ECU.

54
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:19,759
They range tremendously in capability,

55
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,363
from 8051-style microcontrollers up to,

56
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:24,594
you know, multi-gigahertz power PCs

57
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:26,363
or other system-on-a-chip devices.

58
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:28,693
There are dozens of different operating systems

59
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:30,693
and runtimes working together.

60
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,033
The software parts,

61
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,825
those components that control those,

62
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:35,560
can change completely from year to year,

63
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,297
be supplied by a different vendor.

64
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,099
They are all internally connected.

65
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,923
Your car is a big ethernet.

66
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,231
That's the way to think about it.

67
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:44,198
And as time has gone on,

68
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,363
they are increasingly externally connected.

69
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:48,858
Sometimes through things that are very obvious,

70
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,792
like you have, you know,

71
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:52,132
OnStar or SYNC or something

72
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:54,066
that very clearly is a wireless connection.

73
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,264
Sometimes things that you would never even think of

74
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:59,066
as being a wireless connection, like that thing on your radio

75
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,297
that tells you the call sign

76
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:02,858
of the station you're listening to.

77
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:04,231
Well, how the hell does it do that?

78
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:05,726
It's 'cause there's a digital signal

79
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:08,330
that's modulated on the FM band that you thought was analog --

80
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,726
that is analog, but has some digital parts now, too,

81
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:12,594
that we decode in software.

82
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:14,561
All right. So let's take a look

83
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,726
at what a typical automobile looks like.

84
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:20,792
This is a high-level depiction

85
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:25,561
of a car that we looked at that had really two Buses.

86
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,330
You can think of these as two ethernets.

87
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,198
A high-speed Bus, where high-speed here

88
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:30,528
like a half megabit, all right?

89
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:33,495
So, you know, we're talking high-speed 1970s-era

90
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,396
that has all the drivetrain components.

91
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:37,000
A low-speed one --

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,495
ballpark 100 kilobits --

93
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:41,825
that's dealing with things like HVAC and airbag and so forth.

94
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:43,462
And they do need to talk to one another,

95
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:45,297
and one of the myths, I think,

96
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:46,891
is that you can separate these things.

97
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:48,329
And that happens, usually,

98
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,231
through a number of components that act as bridges and proxies.

99
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,957
In our case, there's the body controller,

100
00:03:52,957 --> 00:03:55,132
and then a couple units that I want to point out.

101
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:57,132
One is, in our car, there's this telematics unit,

102
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,132
which has become a pretty standard feature,

103
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:02,264
but was really pioneered successfully by GM

104
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:04,759
through its OnStar system, and that has to talk to everything.

105
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,726
So it can do remote diagnostics

106
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:08,132
and unlock your car

107
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:10,891
and recovery after theft and so forth.

108
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:12,165
And then there's this little thing

109
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:13,759
on the bottom that says OBD-II,

110
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,825
and that is a port

111
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:18,264
that is mandated in the United States by law

112
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:20,297
that connects to everything.

113
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:23,297
All right, that is the ethernet jack for your car.

114
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,462
And this, in turn, runs a slightly different

115
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:26,858
set of protocols than we're used to,

116
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,066
built around what is called the CAN Bus,

117
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,825
that has its own physical air,

118
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:32,198
and then a variety

119
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:36,693
of manufacturer-defined specializations.

120
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,000
All right.

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,726
So from this, I want to talk

122
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,924
about the first security problems that Yoshi highlighted,

123
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:46,825
and that is that the inside of your vehicle

124
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:48,363
is not hardened against attack.

125
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:50,627
That is, once you get inside this network,

126
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:52,165
all bets are off.

127
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:53,594
And so the OBD-II port,

128
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,330
which is that little, you know,

129
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,164
dongle over there on the right,

130
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:58,627
you will find in your vehicle.

131
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,297
If you look underneath the steering wheel

132
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:02,363
on the driver's-side dash, it will appear there.

133
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:04,099
And if you plug into that, all of a sudden,

134
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,495
you have access to everything.

135
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:08,594
And so back in 2010,

136
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:10,858
we showed, "Hey, if you plug in to the car

137
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:12,759
that we got," which now that WIRED

138
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,000
has outed all of this,

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,495
we will say is a 2009 Chevy Impala,

140
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:19,891
"that we could do anything."

141
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:22,627
All right, that from there, we could control the brakes,

142
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,099
we could control the lights,

143
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,561
we could control the engine,

144
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:26,890
and so forth.

145
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,726
And then a little bit later --

146
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:32,561
2014 -- Charlie and Chris

147
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,032
showed exactly the same thing

148
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,693
for a 2010 Toyota Prius and a Ford Escape,

149
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:39,659
and the reason that's important is that is shows it generalizes.

150
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,033
It's not that, like, the Impala is a piece of crap.

151
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,330
It's that, "Hey, the way that these cars are designed

152
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,825
architecturally is such that once you are on the inside,

153
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:51,693
that you can achieve fairly arbitrary results."

154
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:54,957
And the reason for that is multiplicitous.

155
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:57,264
So first, we have a totally open network.

156
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,561
The way that these components are built,

157
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:02,296
in part because they're built by a lot of vendors

158
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,957
and are designed to be loosely coupled,

159
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:06,858
is one of these traditional software Bus-style architectures

160
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:09,264
where everyone puts stuff out on the Bus

161
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:10,627
and then other people consume it.

162
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:12,825
And, in fact, built in to the CAN protocol

163
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:14,659
is this notion that you are basically

164
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,759
sending to an address

165
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,660
that does not necessarily

166
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,000
refer to a particular component, but you have no source address.

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,759
There are no source addresses in CAN.

168
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,396
You are just announcing stuff.

169
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:26,759
And so that's the way that this stuff is built,

170
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,924
and because it is a big, distributed system,

171
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:31,957
there is a huge amount of innate coupling between ECUs.

172
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:34,165
The notion that you could separate

173
00:06:34,165 --> 00:06:36,561
the mission-critical stuff from the non-mission-critical stuff

174
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:38,825
turns out, in practice, to be wrong.

175
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:40,659
Like, your keyless-entry system --

176
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,000
why does it need to control the engine?

177
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,891
Well, on the face of it, it seems like it doesn't,

178
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:46,528
but you need to be able to unlock the doors.

179
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:48,231
That's what keyless entry is for,

180
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:50,296
and it turns out that after you're in a crash,

181
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:52,429
the component that detects there's a crash

182
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,726
has to be able to turn off the engine

183
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,297
and then unlock the doors.

184
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:58,033
So it means that there must be a path

185
00:06:58,033 --> 00:06:59,858
through the system for that function

186
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,858
that gets all the way from the locks

187
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:03,561
and the keyless entry all the way to the engine.

188
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:05,758
And it's not that there's one or two weird one of those,

189
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,396
there are hundreds of those.

190
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:09,264
All right? So give up on the notion

191
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:12,660
that we're gonna separate these two things.

192
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,033
Anyway, a consequence is, quite a bit of the communication

193
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,429
that goes on are effectively RPCs

194
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,693
between these units where they say,

195
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:19,594
"Hey, a little switch went on.

196
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:21,066
You should turn the left blinker."

197
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,924
So you can just listen to that and record it,

198
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:24,330
and that's gonna work because that's built

199
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,758
into the architecture.

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,429
It also turns out we use exactly the same network

201
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:28,561
for maintenance.

202
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:29,693
So when you take your car into the shop,

203
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:31,099
the very first thing the mechanic does

204
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:32,594
is he plugs into that port

205
00:07:32,594 --> 00:07:35,000
and now can put the car in all kinds of unsafe states,

206
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,726
like bleed all of the brake pressure

207
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:39,462
so that I can get there inside the brake drum,

208
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:41,792
which otherwise I couldn't do because it's under pressure.

209
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,561
And same network,

210
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:46,198
so I just pretend I'm a mechanic and all of a sudden

211
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:47,792
I can put your car into unsafe states.

212
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,429
And then, finally, this is what we use for update.

213
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,726
Although the original purpose of the OBD-II was basically

214
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:56,561
to get NO3 measurements

215
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,957
for part of The Clean Air Act,

216
00:07:57,957 --> 00:07:59,231
it has now been multipurposed

217
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,264
into the way that you measure

218
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:04,099
and update every component in the car,

219
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:06,363
and that is how we do it,

220
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:08,759
and so, as a consequence, you can re-flash any of these units

221
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,363
once you have access to the network.

222
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:11,759
Now, there's an obvious criticism,

223
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,660
and boy did we get it in spades, which is, "So what?

224
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,891
You got inside the car, you plugged into the network,

225
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:18,231
and you can mess it up.

226
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,330
Big whoop," which I am paraphrasing

227
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,825
from many of the articles that were written at the time.

228
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:26,759
And that is a fair criticism. I got in the car.

229
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,759
I mean, I could quibble, but I don't have enough time.

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,429
But the challenge is that,

231
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,890
in fact, it's not just the insides --

232
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,264
that you can get to the inside from the outside

233
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:39,462
without ever having any physical access to the car.

234
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:41,726
So, in 2011,

235
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:43,395
we demonstrated remote takeover

236
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:46,132
without any physical access, at an arbitrary distance,

237
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:47,560
over multiple different channels.

238
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:52,495
Although, the most spectacular of which was via GM OnStar,

239
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:54,132
their Generation 8 version.

240
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:57,032
And again, a number of years later,

241
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:58,858
Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek

242
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:01,758
demonstrate the same thing in the Jeep Cherokee.

243
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,561
In this case, leveraging vulnerabilities

244
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,132
in the Fiat UConnect,

245
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:07,132
showing that this is a general issue

246
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:10,000
and not a specific issue to one manufacturer.

247
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,033
And there are a ton of remote compromise vectors,

248
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,297
and I will very briefly

249
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:17,033
highlight what some of these are.

250
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:19,231
There's one that we call the indirect physical channel.

251
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:21,099
These are things where someone does require

252
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:23,660
physical access to the vehicle, but not the adversary.

253
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,858
So, for example, we built an exploit

254
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,957
that worked by re-encoding songs

255
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,264
that would be put on a CD.

256
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:32,231
They will play fine on your laptop,

257
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:34,165
but if you put it in the car, it'll take over the car

258
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,858
due to a vulnerability in the CD player,

259
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:38,957
and from there it would spread over and take over the rest.

260
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:41,165
The mechanic's tools that people plug in --

261
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,957
we did work with after-market dongles

262
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,396
where we showed we could -- that were used

263
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:47,791
by a very popular insurance company

264
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:50,231
for pay-as-you-go insurance -- that we could take over there.

265
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:52,066
And then there were a bunch that we haven't explored,

266
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,528
but I guarantee you there are vulnerabilities.

267
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:55,429
Like charging stations for electric vehicles --

268
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,528
two-way digital communication.

269
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:00,231
And there's a ton of these kinds of things.

270
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:02,495
Then there's what we call short-range wireless,

271
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:03,528
and I think Yoshi mentioned

272
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:05,495
we found vulnerabilities in Bluetooth.

273
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:07,099
Many new cars come with Wi-Fi.

274
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:10,792
Keyless entry actually can be a fairly complicated protocol.

275
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:13,759
The Department of Transportation is very likely

276
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,165
to standardize a thing called DSRC,

277
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:19,660
which is a proximate communications network

278
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,858
for advanced collision avoidance so you can hear about the car

279
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,891
three cars ahead of you that's putting on its brakes.

280
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,527
There are a lot of these short-range digital channels.

281
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:30,429
And then there are the long-range digital channels,

282
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,033
of which the most interesting is cellular,

283
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,825
which are used for telematic services,

284
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:36,792
but there's also things like HD radio,

285
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,495
digital radio, satellite radio.

286
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,330
All of these are digital signals

287
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,561
that are being de-modulated in software in a device

288
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,264
that is directly connected to this network

289
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:46,165
that, as I said, is totally unprotected,

290
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:48,033
and once you're in, it's game over.

291
00:10:48,033 --> 00:10:49,231
All right, so I'm gonna talk really briefly

292
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,396
about the cellular one --

293
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:51,791
it was convenient that someone asked a question --

294
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,000
just to give you a flavor of this.

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,165
And so we were looking at the Generation 8 OnStar,

296
00:10:58,165 --> 00:11:00,858
and it was built around a 3G modem,

297
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:03,560
but access to the device is via voice --

298
00:11:03,561 --> 00:11:05,660
via the voice channel -- and the reason is

299
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,329
that the first feature

300
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,033
that everyone wants out of their telematics unit

301
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,891
is automated crash notification,

302
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:13,858
and voice still has better coverage than 3-D digital.

303
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:15,329
And what you really care about

304
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,594
when you crash is that you can tell someone that you crashed,

305
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,198
not that you have the best bandwidth

306
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:21,132
to tell them about that crash.

307
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:23,858
And so the consequence is that everyone

308
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,824
uses a software modem, which is ironic

309
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:28,297
because the cellular channel is, itself, digital,

310
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:30,363
and so we do two pairs

311
00:11:30,363 --> 00:11:31,825
of D-to-A conversions in doing this

312
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,924
and you only get, you know, 200 bits-per-second out of it.

313
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:38,593
It's a disaster, but this is what is done,

314
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:41,561
and it's real Captain Crunch side-channel stuff.

315
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:43,264
Like, there's a tone that you send down

316
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:46,594
this analog line, and then you switch it to digital mode.

317
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:48,000
But there are two issues. So it turns out

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,264
that the software modem, which is made

319
00:11:49,264 --> 00:11:51,066
by little named Airbiquity,

320
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,627
which we did not find any flaws in.

321
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:54,957
And the telematics code,

322
00:11:54,957 --> 00:11:58,099
which was written by LG, had different assumptions

323
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,660
about how long a packet could be

324
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,660
because Airbiquity's a general piece of software

325
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,429
that's supposed to be used by lots of different people,

326
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:04,824
and LG wrote a piece of software

327
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,132
for talking to the OnStar network

328
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:08,065
and why would anyone ever send a bigger packet

329
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:10,165
than the OnStar network would send?

330
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:13,165
And then there's a detailed error

331
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,891
in the authentication channels,

332
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:17,527
but the end result is that we could encode a song --

333
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,231
and this is another picture of Karl --

334
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:22,693
who just takes the song, calls the car's phone number,

335
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:24,363
and plays the song,

336
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:26,099
and then the car gets taken over.

337
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:28,099
All right? We called it the song of death.

338
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:32,033
And so this is another demonstration.

339
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,825
Again, for some reason, my audio --

340
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,297
I think it's my fault -- the audio isn't there.

341
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,066
But this is where we're gonna remotely

342
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,759
turn on Alexei's brakes,

343
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,000
and you can at least see him skid.

344
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,660
There's the big -- and he goes, "Whoa!"

345
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,791
or something like that.

346
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,858
My sound effects don't do this justice.

347
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,396
But it was bad. It was bad,

348
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:49,065
and, you know, even as, you know,

349
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,132
he knew exactly what was gonna happen and he reported,

350
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:52,924
"Yeah, it was a little scary."

351
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:55,528
So why is it so bad on the remote side?

352
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:58,033
And this is actually, I think, a fair amount more interesting.

353
00:12:58,033 --> 00:13:01,660
No adversaries, so, in fact,

354
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,098
from a Darwinian standpoint,

355
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,165
how do you justify the investment

356
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,693
for putting in security

357
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:08,726
when no one is actually doing anything?

358
00:13:08,726 --> 00:13:11,891
You have a huge amount of pressure on feature creation,

359
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,033
and one of the most important parts

360
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,198
is that the OEM is not the developer,

361
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:18,132
so Ford, GM, whatever --

362
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:19,396
they are not writing all this software.

363
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:20,791
They are the integrator.

364
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:23,495
And this brings us to the supply chain issues.

365
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,066
So the obvious part is, hey,

366
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:27,825
the cost structure here is incredibly --

367
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:30,660
I mean two pennies on a device will decide

368
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,098
who ends up being the supplier,

369
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:35,132
but it also means that because everyone wants to do re-use,

370
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:38,396
every one supplier's code is one piece of code

371
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:40,132
that they sell to everyone who has different needs.

372
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:42,858
And so, invariably, there's extra functionality

373
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,891
in everyone's device that the manufacturer

374
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,329
may or may not know about.

375
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,825
Heterogeneity. All right, here's the one

376
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:50,693
that I think is the most unintuitive.

377
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:53,660
So, if you walk into a car company and say,

378
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,231
"Have you looked at the source code for your vehicle?"

379
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:58,132
I will tell you right now, the answer is "no,"

380
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:00,198
because they do not own it.

381
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:01,759
All right? So all of these solutions

382
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,627
that involve code inspection

383
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:04,858
do not work

384
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:08,000
because there is no party in the world

385
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,594
that has all of the source code to a modern automobile.

386
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:12,495
It belongs to the independent vendors

387
00:14:12,495 --> 00:14:14,033
for whom they have actually

388
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,858
very tight intellectual property concerns

389
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,726
about what they're gonna share and for how much.

390
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,891
And then, finally, no one really has much experience

391
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:23,264
with product security.

392
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:25,132
Okay. And I can talk more about these

393
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,527
in the Q and A if people are interested.

394
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:28,792
So now we discover all this stuff

395
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,693
and the question is, "What do you do?"

396
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:32,824
What do you do? There's a big problem.

397
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,165
It affects, in our case,

398
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,660
about maybe 10 million vehicles,

399
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,726
and we would like to make the world a better place.

400
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,396
We don't wake up in the morning saying, "You know

401
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,132
what I really want to do is embarrass a bunch of people."

402
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,165
I would actually like to make the world better.

403
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:45,957
And so we can provide the information

404
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:47,660
and the knowledge that we have acquired,

405
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,065
and hopefully we can create some incentives

406
00:14:50,066 --> 00:14:52,132
to act on that knowledge -- that we're not just throwing a paper

407
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:54,165
over the fence that everyone ignores.

408
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:57,726
But we would like to do so in a way that minimizes harm,

409
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,495
and in our case, this was

410
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:03,858
harm of the variety where all of a sudden,

411
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:06,957
you know, people start crashing into things.

412
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:08,363
And this is a tricky balance,

413
00:15:08,363 --> 00:15:10,330
and so I'm gonna talk in particular about some

414
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,891
of our thought processes around disclosure in this domain

415
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:17,693
and some contrast with Chris and Charlie.

416
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:20,693
All right, so here's the story.

417
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:23,660
We had everything in early 2010, pretty much.

418
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,528
All right? We delayed publishing

419
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:26,825
the remote vulnerabilities in part

420
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,759
because we were not completely sure

421
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,198
about what to do about them.

422
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,066
And so we made a number

423
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:36,726
of active choices

424
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:39,264
in what we were going to do

425
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,924
and one of them was to work directly

426
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:44,593
with the OEM and the regulator up front --

427
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,792
that we were not going to do name-and-shame.

428
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,462
This is the first time, I think, in public

429
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:50,098
that we've talked about this, and this is only

430
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:54,264
because WIRED basically got them to admit it.

431
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:56,165
And we did not release any coder details.

432
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,296
You cannot read any of our papers and replicate our work,

433
00:15:58,297 --> 00:16:02,132
which is a very strange thing for scientists to admit,

434
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:03,396
and there were a number of reasons for it.

435
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,132
So number one -- our primary goal

436
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,132
was to have our work improve automotive security

437
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:11,891
and, hence, make people feel safer on the road.

438
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,527
We did not believe that there was anything unique

439
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:15,858
either to the make or model

440
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:18,231
or the OEM to the problems that we were finding.

441
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,429
We just could not afford to buy,

442
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:22,396
you know, eight different cars and hack them all.

443
00:16:22,396 --> 00:16:24,560
Though we did get one review that was like,

444
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:25,825
"Well, this would be more impressive

445
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:27,594
if you would have done it to three different cars."

446
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:30,594
[ Laughs ] Geez.

447
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:32,792
And the other part was that we realized,

448
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,363
at the time,

449
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:36,660
both at the federal level

450
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,593
and at the manufacturing level, there was very little capacity

451
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:41,000
to do anything about the problem at the time.

452
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,495
They were, I think, completely shocked

453
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:45,825
with what we showed up with.

454
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:49,594
And there was no incident response team.

455
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:53,594
There was no "here's how you fix 10 million cars".

456
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:56,165
The regulators had no idea what even to do.

457
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:57,693
They didn't have anyone who understood anything

458
00:16:57,693 --> 00:16:58,726
about cyber security.

459
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,099
I mean, it was really a disaster.

460
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:05,066
And so if we put all of that out there,

461
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,825
there were gonna be a whole bunch of people

462
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,165
who had the means to make, you know,

463
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:12,594
many millions of cars be able to crash on demand,

464
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:14,132
and it was not clear that they were gonna be able

465
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:15,462
to fix anything anytime soon,

466
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:17,693
which, you know, makes it hard to sleep at night.

467
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,263
So what happened?

468
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:21,890
I'll talk about the plus parts, first.

469
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:24,924
In the short term, we work pretty closely with GM

470
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:26,396
to fix all the things

471
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:28,924
we found in the next model year and in Generation 9 OnStar.

472
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,495
So the particular bugs we found -- got rid of.

473
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:33,726
And there were a bunch of mitigations that got rolled out

474
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:35,858
on the cell carrier that were not full-proof,

475
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:38,627
but made it harder to do some of the things we did.

476
00:17:38,627 --> 00:17:39,956
In the medium term,

477
00:17:39,957 --> 00:17:43,561
GM really got security religion in a big way.

478
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,165
They have a CSO just for product security,

479
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,726
so not the IT side of the shop, but like making cars secure.

480
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:50,792
They have 100 people. That's just their job --

481
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:54,297
to make sure that GM's cars have cybersecurity in them.

482
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:56,297
There are a whole bunch of changes

483
00:17:56,297 --> 00:18:00,363
to both development practice in what they do,

484
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,330
quite a few adopted from

485
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,197
other people's security design,

486
00:18:05,198 --> 00:18:06,858
lifecycle kinds of processes.

487
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:08,099
They got a bunch of training.

488
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,627
They changed their contracting practice

489
00:18:09,627 --> 00:18:12,363
in terms of what they have their suppliers do.

490
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,330
And the design input has gone

491
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,033
into the next generation of electrical design.

492
00:18:16,033 --> 00:18:17,693
So they -- I'm not gonna tell you

493
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:19,264
that there are not vulnerabilities

494
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,593
in GM's current cars, 'cause I don't know

495
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:23,330
that there are, but come on.

496
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,627
They're big and complicated.

497
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:27,363
But they're in a much better position

498
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:29,561
than they were when we started in 2010.

499
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:32,297
But that didn't do anything

500
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:34,924
for all the Generation 8 vehicles out there,

501
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:40,066
which, again, probably in the 10-million range.

502
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:42,033
This is a tricky decision, all right?

503
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:44,099
We could've made a big stink and forced a recall.

504
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:46,495
And you got to think about what's the cost benefit on that?

505
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,165
For multiple reasons -- one is, like, there's actual costs.

506
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:50,396
And, you know, ballpark,

507
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,693
$200 per vehicle recalled is cost to manufacturer.

508
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:58,132
But the other is that its very rare that you actually get

509
00:18:58,132 --> 00:19:02,099
even the majority of vehicles fixed in a recall.

510
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,528
People just don't bring them in.

511
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:04,792
And so you're gonna have a whole bunch

512
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:07,231
of things on there, on the road for a long time,

513
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,132
and so then you say, "What is the rediscovery risk

514
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:10,924
that someone else would've come up with this?"

515
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:14,462
And so we made a decision not to do anything.

516
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:15,726
Five years later,

517
00:19:15,726 --> 00:19:17,495
and this is a pretty interesting WIRED story,

518
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:21,428
it comes out that GM remotely fixed

519
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,231
all of Generation 8 OnStar units.

520
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,363
The reason this is interesting is Generation 8 OnStar

521
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:30,000
has no ability to do a remote update.

522
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,066
All right?

523
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:33,693
So I'm gonna let you use your mind

524
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,495
to figure out what must've happened.

525
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:40,527
I am not saying that GM hacked millions of its own cars...

526
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:43,132
but something happened.

527
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:45,594
And it's incredibly ballsy.

528
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:47,132
All right, so,

529
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:51,792
by contrast, Charlie and Chris did everything very public.

530
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,462
2013 -- their OBD-II stuff

531
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:55,627
they disclosed completely publicly.

532
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,659
These are architectural issues, so there's no fix.

533
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,528
I don't think this was a big deal one way or the other.

534
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:01,264
UConnect is much more interesting.

535
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,792
There, they did coordinate a disclosure.

536
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,561
So they talked to Fiat and NHTSA well in advance.

537
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:08,197
The patches were available before their public release

538
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:10,726
of details or code.

539
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,660
Fiat instituted a voluntary recall

540
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,594
under incredible pressure from NHTSA,

541
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:16,627
which is the National Highway

542
00:20:16,627 --> 00:20:18,033
and Traffic Safety Administration.

543
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,362
And, conveniently enough,

544
00:20:19,363 --> 00:20:23,033
there was a mitigation at the cell level

545
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:26,231
that pretty much blocked the pure cell-oriented compromise.

546
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:28,495
So there was a real protection at the network level.

547
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,462
Unprecedented impact on public perception,

548
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,165
because they were on "Good Morning America" and so forth.

549
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,726
All right, I'm gonna skip this part,

550
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:35,858
'cause I'm at the end --

551
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:37,561
some musing about which one of us was right,

552
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:39,131
and we can do that in Q and A.

553
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,891
There's some pretty interesting, I think, trade-offs there.

554
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:44,033
I will talk for 30 seconds

555
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,890
about indirect things that have happened.

556
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:48,165
One, every manufacturer on the planet

557
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,594
either has remote update and admits it

558
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:53,132
or doesn't admit it or is about to announce it.

559
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,297
Remote update is now a standard thing in cars.

560
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,561
So Windows Update in all your cars --

561
00:20:57,561 --> 00:20:58,890
that's the way it's gonna be.

562
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:02,429
It's because the cost of not having it is too great.

563
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,726
The Society of Automotive Engineers,

564
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:07,165
which is the standards body, now has cybersecurity standards

565
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,792
as a direct result of all the research

566
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,131
that's gone on here.

567
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:13,363
NHTSA, in fact, has now a cybersecurity testing lab.

568
00:21:13,363 --> 00:21:15,462
And, for better or worse,

569
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:18,462
there are two currently drafted bills,

570
00:21:18,462 --> 00:21:19,495
one in the House and one in the Senate,

571
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,000
and at least two more on the way,

572
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,792
focused on cybersecurity of vehicles.

573
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,396
And I'm happy to talk more about that in Q and A.

574
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,428
So, finally, to summarize,

575
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:28,825
two things I want you to remember.

576
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:31,165
Number one, automobiles --

577
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,594
computers with wheels. All right?

578
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:33,891
It's not the other way around.

579
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:37,231
That there are a lot of complicated issues

580
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:39,363
that make it challenging to fix these bugs.

581
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,165
It's not as easy as just saying "Hey,

582
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:45,033
you know, let's add some encryption to that."

583
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,495
But it is a place

584
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:48,065
where the security community, I think,

585
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:50,891
without any kind of ambiguity,

586
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:54,099
played the key role in pushing this stuff forward.

587
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:56,495
And then, finally, disclosure

588
00:21:56,495 --> 00:21:59,197
is a pretty tricky question

589
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:00,594
when you have real-life harms.

590
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:02,594
And there are different advantages

591
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:04,924
to doing it each way,

592
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,264
depending on what your goals are.

593
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:08,462
With that, I'll stop and take any questions.

594
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:07,462
