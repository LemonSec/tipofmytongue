1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:04,825


2
00:00:04,825 --> 00:00:06,594
PETERSON: Thank you
very much, David.

3
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:09,165
That was a very kind welcome.

4
00:00:09,165 --> 00:00:11,000
So, as David said,
I am Zachary Peterson.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,660
I teach computer science
and mostly computer security

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,396
at Cal Poly,
San Luis Obispo.

7
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:18,264
And for the last five years
or so, I've been using game

8
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:20,660
and play to teach
computer security concepts

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,033
to new and younger audiences

10
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:24,891
that wouldn't typically have
access to such content.

11
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,264
I'd like to share
some of my experiences

12
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:27,462
with you today.

13
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:29,627
So like many schools right now,

14
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:32,066
Cal Poly's now
on the cyber train.

15
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,957
And cynicism of that kind

16
00:00:33,957 --> 00:00:35,660
of mostly meaningless
prefix aside,

17
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,593
it's a genuine recognition
and response

18
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:39,000
to our nation's critical need

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,561
for qualified computer
security professionals.

20
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:43,198
Year after year, we see reports

21
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:44,858
not only on the current dearth,

22
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:47,000
both in the public and private
sector for these professionals,

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,759
but an ever increasing gap

24
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,297
between the number
of professionals

25
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:52,956
we need and the number
we expect to produce.

26
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:55,561
Burning Glass reports that
the cybersecurity job openings

27
00:00:55,561 --> 00:00:59,396
are growing three times faster
than typical IT jobs,

28
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:03,495
and this is in spite
of a salary premium of 9%

29
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:05,923
over those other IT jobs.

30
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:08,891
The 2014 Computer Research
Association Taulbee Survey,

31
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:11,198
which tracks
university degree productions

32
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:12,923
in computing backs this up.

33
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:16,462
So while overall CS degree
production is on the rise,

34
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:19,099
there's actually been a small
decline of the number of PhDs

35
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:21,429
in information security
from the previous year,

36
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:23,231
from 5% to 4%.

37
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,428
And what's more,
who we're producing

38
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,792
aren't very diverse,
with a vast majority

39
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:30,066
being White and Asian males.

40
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,660
The College Board annual report

41
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,792
on the computer science AP exam,
probably our best measure

42
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:36,495
of high school engagement
and availability

43
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:38,759
of computer science
track similarly,

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,165
both in terms of interest
and demographics.

45
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:44,033
Okay,
so we're not producing enough.

46
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:46,000
But does
security need diversity?

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,198
If we could produce more of
the same, is our problem solved?

48
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:50,660
And the answer's no.

49
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,198
I think there's
a real strong argument

50
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:54,627
for diversity as an issue
of equality and fairness,

51
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:56,396
and I think
this resonates with most.

52
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:59,363
But even if we were trying
to continue down the same path,

53
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:01,825
White males are becoming
a minority in this country,

54
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:05,462
and by not including women and
other represented minorities,

55
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:07,198
our problem's only
going to get worse.

56
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:09,363
And perhaps most importantly,
and as William Wulf stated --

57
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,627
he's a former president

58
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:12,330
of the National Academy
of Engineering --

59
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,759
that the quality of engineering
is affected by diversity.

60
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,692
So,
a diversity perspective

61
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:20,396
means making new connections,

62
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,065
seeing problems
in different ways,

63
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,000
removing
the perceptional blindness

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,264
that comes from monoculture.

65
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:30,066
So yes, diversity is important,
particularly in security.

66
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, so given all this,
why are our numbers so bad?

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,594
Well, for one, CS

68
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,528
is underrepresented
in the CS curricula

69
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:38,132
and curricular standards.

70
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:40,462
For example, the ACM Computer
Science Curricula

71
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:42,396
2013 guidelines
recommends a minimum

72
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,263
of 3 contact hours

73
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,330
of information assurance
and security

74
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,726
throughout an entire
CS undergraduate program.

75
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,495
Further, security
is often relegated

76
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:53,858
to a technical elective seen

77
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:56,957
only by a subset
of self-selected students

78
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:59,429
typically
in the computing majors,

79
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,198
and at the end
of a long prerequisite chain.

80
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,957
This is truly a disservice.

81
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:06,858
First, it unnecessarily
constrains the student body

82
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:09,099
to those of
already self-selected security

83
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,825
and have already suffered
the first year attrition

84
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,462
that's commonly seen
in CS programs.

85
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:17,726
Second,
upper division students

86
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:20,495
have already established habits,
and not just programming habits,

87
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,429
but the way
that they approach problems

88
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:23,924
and their computing behaviors.

89
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:27,429
And so even if they were to try
to change those behaviors,

90
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:30,726
they've now limited their runway
to practice these new behaviors

91
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:32,825
before they're delivered
to the workforce.

92
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:36,297
And then, third, and I think
this audience would agree,

93
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:38,329
security is no longer
a specialization.

94
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,396
It can't just be an elective.

95
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:41,857
It's a core competency

96
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,693
that every computing major
and probably

97
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:46,495
beyond, needs to see.

98
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:47,825
Okay.

99
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:49,197
So what's the problem?

100
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:51,693
Well, why security issues
permeate nearly all aspects

101
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:54,264
of our day-to-day lives,
the technical complexities

102
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:55,462
and mundane subtleties

103
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:57,197
do not immediately
lend themselves

104
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:58,726
to lower division curricula.

105
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:00,231
Exposing pre-college students

106
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:03,626
to these same ideas are
further problematized

107
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:05,495
by these same issues.

108
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,957
Okay, so more importantly,

109
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:09,792
security
can really problematize --

110
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,165
make worse --

111
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:13,692
some of the same qualities
we've seen in CS,

112
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:17,726
that it's viewed
as isolating and antisocial

113
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:20,099
or the domain
of asocial males,

114
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,858
that it lacks creativity,

115
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,891
that it lacks social impact,

116
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:27,231
or that it has any relevance
to the real world.

117
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:29,891
Okay, so I think
that there's a way

118
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,495
that we can change these things,

119
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:34,033
and that's with
cybersecurity games, okay.

120
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:35,462
So, there's been
a recent explosion

121
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:37,825
of both the number
and diversity of these games.

122
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:40,396
CTFTime, which is a website
that tracks these events,

123
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:44,858
claims an average of 56 events
per year since 2013.

124
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:46,825
That's over one a week.
Now, these events

125
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:49,594
range from one-off
asynchronous challenges

126
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:52,594
to those that focus
on particular skill sets

127
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:55,066
to those that are actually
designed to train

128
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:57,131
or even evaluate job candidates,

129
00:04:57,132 --> 00:05:00,231
to annual full simulation
cyber war games,

130
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:02,528
where the game mechanics,
the time scale,

131
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:03,924
and the technical skills

132
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:07,594
necessary to play on them
simulate the real world nearly

133
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:10,429
perfectly.

134
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:12,330
Okay, these games can be social,

135
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,164
at least as our community
defines social.

136
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:17,726
Games have a real element
of competition,

137
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:20,363
which is naturally appealing
to a community

138
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,363
that historically
values competition.

139
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,429
So, for example,
in bragging rights

140
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:27,462
and street cred, but are they
pedagogically meaningful?

141
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:30,296
Are they good tools for outreach
as some have claimed?

142
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:34,429
Or are they simply equivalent
to the upper division electives,

143
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:38,395
which are drawing these same
self-selected populations?

144
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:39,957
So, can these games be more?

145
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,659
Can they help fix what's wrong

146
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,693
with computer security
education?

147
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,726
Well, it's no surprise,
given that I'm up here,

148
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,132
is that I do believe games

149
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:51,264
can be a really amazing tool
for computer security education.

150
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:53,330
And it's because games
inspire players

151
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,099
to challenge the limits of play

152
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:58,527
by exploring with the meaning
and interpretation of rules.

153
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,264
Similarly,
red teaming, right,

154
00:06:00,264 --> 00:06:02,594
where rule testing,
rule interpretation,

155
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,924
rule breaking
are all prerequisite skills.

156
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:07,693
Strategic thinking, identifying
adversarial motivations,

157
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:09,099
moves, countermoves --

158
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,231
these are things that are
all foundational to both games

159
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,099
and security engineering.

160
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:15,594
So said another way,

161
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:19,296
many cybersecurity concepts
are game concepts.

162
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:23,627
So games are a natural vector
for teaching the subject matter.

163
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,198
So with this in mind,

164
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:27,758
and with support from
the National Science Foundation,

165
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,429
Google, and Intel,

166
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:32,758
I helped develop a new course
at Cal Poly called CPE123,

167
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,165
designed to engage first year
undergraduate students

168
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:37,462
in CS and computer
security principles

169
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:41,296
through a sets of thematically
connected game-like coursework.

170
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:42,891
The broad objective
of the course

171
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,264
was to attract undergraduates

172
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:47,297
with no prior experience
in computer science or security

173
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:48,759
using authentic problems

174
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,429
that demonstrated the relevance

175
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:52,263
of security
to the world around them,

176
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:54,825
to highlight the role of
computers in solving problems,

177
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,066
and to challenge students

178
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,726
to think adversarially
and counterfactually,

179
00:06:58,726 --> 00:07:02,660
all while making an engaging
an immersive experience.

180
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,264
So, the first program

181
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:06,396
many of the students
will ever write

182
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:07,759
is a password cracker,

183
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,297
designed to break
increasingly difficult levels

184
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,297
of an online password manager.

185
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:13,759
So, through this assignment,

186
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,429
first-year students now
address security concepts

187
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:19,131
head on -- authentication,
hardness amplification,

188
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:21,726
cryptography,
the limits of computing.

189
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:23,330
Also,
this program assignment

190
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,693
encodes many of the elements

191
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:26,264
that we strive to communicate

192
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:29,561
in a traditional introduction
to programming class.

193
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:33,263
Loops, conditionals,
methods, right?

194
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:35,396
It's all there.
But here,

195
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:38,792
the method
is approachable, okay,

196
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,726
it's contextual, it's engaging,

197
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,231
it's scaffolded, okay.

198
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:45,726
So, this allows the students
to engage in these ideas

199
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,759
at their pace.

200
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.
So in addition to the exposure

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,957
to core computer science ideas

202
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:54,396
and security concepts,
this approach

203
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:56,858
naturally embeds many
of the pedagogical methods

204
00:07:56,858 --> 00:08:00,462
identified as important to
and effective in stem learning.

205
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:02,363
So, these include
reflective journaling

206
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:04,363
as part of
a team's progress log,

207
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:06,033
near-peer instruction,

208
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,561
and process oriented
guided inquiry learning,

209
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,363
where the assumption of roles
and independent exploration

210
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:13,297
of a topic increase retention

211
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:15,594
and understanding
of the course content.

212
00:08:15,594 --> 00:08:18,099
So we've got kind
of all the right elements.

213
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:20,198
Are we actually making
any effect?

214
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:23,561
Are they learning anything?
So, we measured this.

215
00:08:23,561 --> 00:08:25,462
Now I can advance the slide.
Here we go.

216
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:27,957
So in our study,
we used the methodology

217
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:30,198
that consisted of
a mixed method approach.

218
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:32,495
We use pre-
and post-course surveys,

219
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:34,561
we analyzed
those reflective journals,

220
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,066
and we conducted student

221
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,627
interviews
at the end of the course.

222
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:40,296
We were interested in accessing
course gray metrics,

223
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,000
things like,
"was the course fun?"

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,363
But we also wanted to measure
students' attitudes

225
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:45,792
towards security.

226
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,231
Specifically, we wanted
to ascertain the beliefs

227
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:49,858
about their self-perceived
abilities

228
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,924
to be successful
in computer security,

229
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:54,066
and how they perceive
computer security

230
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,627
as a discipline broadly.

231
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:58,758
Overall, our results
were really, really positive.

232
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:01,726
So, students
describe the exercise as fun,

233
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:03,858
or wouldn't have been fun
if taught another way,

234
00:09:03,858 --> 00:09:05,429
that the cloak-and-dagger themes

235
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:07,363
really drew them
into the content

236
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:10,099
and helped them make connections
to the real world.

237
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:13,099
We measured both an increase
in a student engagement

238
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:14,396
in security as a discipline,

239
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:16,231
as well as their self-efficacy

240
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:18,957
in their perception
of success as a field.

241
00:09:18,957 --> 00:09:20,660
Okay, so at the end
of the course, we asked students

242
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,528
if their day-to-day security
behaviors had changed,

243
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:26,165
and many reported
that they improved things

244
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,165
like their physical security
on their devices.

245
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:31,824
They were more curious
and cautious when

246
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:33,726
visiting websites,
including one of my freshman

247
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,858
who discovered a cross-site
scripting vulnerability

248
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,627
in a local eatery's website.

249
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:40,231
They improved
their password habits.

250
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,363
Now interestingly,
we actually had a number

251
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:45,297
of students who said they
did not change their behaviors,

252
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:48,396
but their cognition
and reasoning behind that choice

253
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:51,660
demonstrated thoughtfulness,
analysis, and self-reflection.

254
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,329
So, for example,
one of our students

255
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,561
said that I'm not going
to change my relatively weak

256
00:09:56,561 --> 00:09:58,594
Netflix password --
sorry, Brian --

257
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,330
and this is because, like,

258
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,033
typing a better one
on my mobile device,

259
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,462
which is where I watch
all my Netflix, is too onerous.

260
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:08,660
Plus, that I think
the risk associated with,

261
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,000
or the harm associated
with a compromise of the account

262
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,792
is low, at least for him.

263
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,792
All right, this is great.
I mean, it's not ideal,

264
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,495
but it's a good start.

265
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:18,330
So, by using games
and play,

266
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,132
we've been able to make
some small progress

267
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:21,527
in computer security education,

268
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:23,264
at least at Cal Poly.

269
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:26,462
Now, of course, this is a course
for freshmen at Cal Poly

270
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:29,132
who have already chosen
to be computer science majors.

271
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:32,032
We need to reach students
at a much earlier age,

272
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,330
and games can help here, too.

273
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,264
So there's been some recent
work, including my own,

274
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:37,825
in the use of tabletop games,

275
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:39,330
board and card games

276
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,660
for both computer
science education,

277
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,264
and computer security outreach.

278
00:10:44,264 --> 00:10:47,429
These types of games
have some real unique advantages

279
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,264
over their digital counterparts.

280
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:50,528
So, for one,
these games

281
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:52,462
can be accessible
with the potential

282
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:55,363
to engage students
with low computer confidence

283
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,759
or low computer literacy.

284
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,528
They are extremely social.

285
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,495
Being faithful
to a player's expectation

286
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,495
for what a social interaction
looks like.

287
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,726
So dispelling perhaps
the perception of CS

288
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:07,429
as purely isolating.

289
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:08,693
They're unobtrusive.

290
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:11,264
They require
no technical support staff

291
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:13,165
or expensive equipment.

292
00:11:13,165 --> 00:11:15,627
They can be deployed
in a classroom or a club

293
00:11:15,627 --> 00:11:18,495
cheaply and easily.
And they're modest.

294
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,825
They make no pretense
of representing reality,

295
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:23,594
but at the same time,

296
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:28,429
allow us to engage in kind
of real security concepts

297
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,462
but in a much more
approachable way.

298
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:35,033
So, my first game, d0x3d!,
is a collaborative board game

299
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,891
in which players assume
the roles of white hat hackers

300
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:40,198
and collaboratively are tasked

301
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,329
to retrieve a set
of digital assets

302
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,363
that have been held
in an adversarial network.

303
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:46,693
Now, here,
the game mechanics

304
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,957
are strongly inspired

305
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,396
by Matt Leacock's
"Forbidden Island,"

306
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:51,098
if you've ever played that game.
It's a great game.

307
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:52,561
The intention
of d0x3d!

308
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:53,924
is to create
an artificial context

309
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:56,329
for discussing real ideas
and network security.

310
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,165
There's been
a real conscious effort here

311
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:01,726
to introduce
meaningful terminology

312
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:04,099
in simplified
but evocative mechanics

313
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,363
that are consistent
with real world interpretations.

314
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:07,594
So, in our game,
players

315
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,693
compromise
network infrastructure tiles,

316
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:11,561
they discover zero-day cards

317
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:14,264
and use them to keep
those notes compromised,

318
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:16,264
all in the face
of an adversarial network

319
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,396
administrator
that patches infrastructure

320
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,165
and removes
these compromised tiles

321
00:12:20,165 --> 00:12:22,891
for forensic investigation.

322
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:25,363
So, with support from
the National Science Foundation

323
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:26,759
to develop and evaluate d0x3d!,

324
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,396
I've been very fortunate
to play with hundreds

325
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:30,891
of students
both across secondary

326
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:32,759
and post-secondary education.

327
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,033
We found that d0x3d!

328
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,033
has a real potential
to start a dialog

329
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,330
with young audiences
about the value of data,

330
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,429
to demonstrate where the game
deviates from reality,

331
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,065
and to expose students
to opportunities

332
00:12:44,066 --> 00:12:45,858
as computer security
professionals,

333
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:48,560
but in a very relaxed
and playful setting.

334
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,429
So, beyond the instructor-led
activities, d0x3d!

335
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:54,065
provides some real opportunities
for informal learning, too.

336
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,957
Here, both these students
have claimed to have created

337
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:59,264
the toughest game
board possible, okay,

338
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:01,693
by placing all the digital
asset capture points

339
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,198
at the very edge
of the board

340
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:05,329
and behind nodes that are
more difficult to compromise,

341
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,165
thus making the assets
more difficult to acquire.

342
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:10,429
This is great.
This is a concrete example

343
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,000
of adversarial thinking,

344
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,594
and, you know, pretty much

345
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:15,660
exactly what a real network
security engineer

346
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,000
might do in the course
of designing a real topology.

347
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,759
Now, here,
students

348
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,726
have combined two sets
of the game to do

349
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:25,759
I'm not sure what, okay,
but they were pretty excited

350
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,198
to do it.

351
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:29,528
But what's great
here is that d0x3d!,

352
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,297
like many games,
allows the freedom

353
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:34,033
to be creative, to adapt,
and to modify the rules,

354
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:36,066
and to develop
new strategies, okay,

355
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,297
all in a playful social setting.

356
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:43,693
So the names of the assets
are very generically named.

357
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:46,726
Intellectual property,
authentication credentials, PII,

358
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:49,000
and financial data.
And this was intentional,

359
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,330
and we leverage it
as a teachable moment.

360
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,462
As part
of the core game,

361
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,891
we provide blank
digital asset mats,

362
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:57,296
so the players can customize
their digital assets

363
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:59,363
that they seek out in the game,
perhaps inspiring them

364
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:00,957
to consider the value

365
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:02,924
of their own real life
digital assets.

366
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:05,627
Our experiences here,
too, have been amazing.

367
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,165
One of my students
replaced intellectual property

368
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:10,791
with grandma's secret
fried chicken recipe,

369
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,099
which had recently
been transferred

370
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:13,726
to the family's
personal computer.

371
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:15,264
Like, this is awesome, right?

372
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:18,099
This is a contextual connection
that she made about something

373
00:14:18,099 --> 00:14:20,099
that was very valuable
to her and her family

374
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,627
that probably couldn't happen

375
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:27,329
in a less analog,
or a less social way.

376
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,924
So, d0x3d!
is free and open source.

377
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:33,165
Anyone can create
their own modifications,

378
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:36,429
their translations, and download
and print their own copies.

379
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:38,033
Here we see a guy
who downloaded it

380
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,924
and then tweeted about it.

381
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:42,098
Our retail version,

382
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:43,363
a retail-quality version
of the game

383
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,825
is available from
The Game Crafter,

384
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:47,165
which is a print-on-demand
game publisher,

385
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:49,924
where we sell the game
at its lowest allowable cost,

386
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:52,329
basically just whatever the cost
of the parts are.

387
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,330
Now I'm proud to say, to date,
we've actually sold

388
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,627
over 1,200 copies of the game

389
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:59,198
all across the globe.

390
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,759
In addition, on the project's
website, d0x3d.com,

391
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,660
we host a number of curriculum
modules that provide guidance

392
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,495
for teachers of all disciplines
and all student levels

393
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:09,726
to leave follow-on discussions
and activities

394
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,363
around cybersecurity topics.

395
00:15:11,363 --> 00:15:13,330
So using d0x3d!
as a catalyst.

396
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,693
And we also include
how these activities

397
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:17,627
map to common core standards.

398
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:21,627
So, using d0x3d! as a data point
here and extrapolating,

399
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:25,593
there's evidence
that there's a real opportunity

400
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:28,033
to use these games for outreach

401
00:15:28,033 --> 00:15:30,132
and start thinking
about security

402
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:34,329
at grades as low
as third and fourth grade.

403
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,693
The last project
I'd like to share

404
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:39,066
with you is a collection
of kinesthetic security games

405
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:41,792
that I'm starting to design
using the same sort

406
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:44,132
of informal approach
to security education.

407
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:45,693
We're currently
play testing these as part

408
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,891
of a week-long security themed
summer camp that's held --

409
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:51,858
called EPIC, that's
held annually at Cal Poly.

410
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:55,429
Here we see students attempting
to fool the gate guard

411
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,165
of an opposing team's castle

412
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,858
into letting them in by making
false claims about their origin,

413
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,924
their destination,
and what they're carrying.

414
00:16:02,924 --> 00:16:04,528
Sound familiar, right?

415
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,693
So while here we see a team
trying to invent

416
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:09,396
a gate access policy,

417
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,824
where it's required
to accept more visitors

418
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:14,396
than they have states
to describe that policy.

419
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:16,593
Now, with some recent funding
from the NSF,

420
00:16:16,594 --> 00:16:18,924
we're going to be able
to expand this curriculum

421
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:22,165
and offer need-based
scholarships to EPIC this year.

422
00:16:22,165 --> 00:16:25,363
Okay, so is our problem solved?
Not quite.

423
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:27,594
Okay, there's still
many challenges associated

424
00:16:27,594 --> 00:16:29,561
with the use of games
in security education.

425
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:32,198
So, for example, terminology.

426
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:33,792
Our community
really struggles

427
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,858
in presenting existing games
to established players,

428
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:38,824
designing new games
to reach new players,

429
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:40,264
and interfacing with educators

430
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,495
for the use of games
in clubs and classrooms.

431
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,495
It also further suggests
some missing research

432
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:47,462
on who players are and what
they need from this community.

433
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:50,033
And most significantly,
there's a real lack

434
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:53,066
of common assessments and tools
for measuring engagement.

435
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,561
Currently, we have no way
to comparatively measure

436
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:57,825
what student populations
are we reaching?

437
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,627
Is their perception
of security changing at all?

438
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,296
Are they even being entertained?

439
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:02,759
Are we doubling down on

440
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,098
the "you must be this tall
to ride" mentality

441
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:07,362
we've taken
with security electives?

442
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:10,264
So to this end,
I've co-founded a new workshop

443
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,560
with my colleague Mark Gondree,

444
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,066
to be collocated
with USENIX Security this year

445
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,560
called Advancements
in Security Education, or ASE.

446
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,759
Now, ASE is dedicated

447
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,791
to bringing together
security educators,

448
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,131
pedagogical researchers,

449
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:22,528
and practitioners,
particularly those

450
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,462
that use games for education

451
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,231
to address
some of these challenges

452
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:30,924
and to help make a science
from what is now an art.

453
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,297
But what can you do?
All right, start

454
00:17:33,297 --> 00:17:36,561
by promoting security education
in your community.

455
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:37,759
Bring a copy of d0x3d!

456
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,693
to your local
high school CS club,

457
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,198
or to a girl scout troop,

458
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:43,792
or to an after-school program.

459
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:47,231
And use it as an opportunity
to share your experiences

460
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:49,693
about computer security
and this discipline.

461
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,099
Don't have a club?
Help make one.

462
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:54,264
There's now
tremendous resources online

463
00:17:54,264 --> 00:17:58,693
for helping
seed age-appropriate activities

464
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:00,495
for those clubs.

465
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:03,099
Also, invent your own games
and share them with us.

466
00:18:03,099 --> 00:18:05,362
Our umbrella project,
Tabletop Security,

467
00:18:05,363 --> 00:18:07,891
now has a repository for them,

468
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,957
so in a community space
where you can share your games,

469
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,627
you can play them, discuss them,
and get them improved.

470
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:16,363
But most importantly,
show those around you

471
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,462
that computer security
can be fun,

472
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:21,000
it can be relevant,
and it can be inclusive.

473
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,264
So, can games fix

474
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:25,659
what's wrong with
computer security education?

475
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,594
I think so,
but let's find out.

476
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:30,198
It's our turn to play.
Thank you.

477
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:31,924
