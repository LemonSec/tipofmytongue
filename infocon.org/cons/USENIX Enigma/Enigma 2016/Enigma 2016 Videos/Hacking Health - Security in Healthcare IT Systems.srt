-There's a crisis in China,

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,627
and I'm not talking about the financial crisis.

6
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:17,660
That's not my area.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,429
I'm talking about the government training

8
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:25,165
and sponsoring over 30,000 hackers

9
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:27,791
to come after our systems.

10
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:33,462
And these poor hackers are being completely overwhelmed.

11
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:35,363
You can see in this article that describes

12
00:00:35,363 --> 00:00:37,495
that they're unable to keep up with us.

13
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,759
And so they're outsourcing some of this hacking to the Chinese.

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,726
It's described in this article.

15
00:00:46,594 --> 00:00:50,726
So, let me talk about my first security evaluation

16
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:52,660
that I was hired to do.

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,561
In 2003,

18
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,132
the Federal Trade Commission

19
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:59,660
was investigating one of the major rental-car companies

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,924
because of complaints they received about the way

21
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:03,693
that they handled personably

22
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:06,594
identifiable information of their customers.

23
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:09,164
I can't tell you exactly which car company it was,

24
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:10,858
but their logo is one of the ones

25
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,792
that I included here.

26
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:16,858
And they were doing things that were pretty bad,

27
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,561
like distributing the credit-card numbers

28
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:23,957
of their customers in the little ticket

29
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:26,363
that you would get when you rent a car.

30
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:29,924
They also made all kinds of mistakes

31
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,297
in how they configured their systems and their networks.

32
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:34,131
So, their computer-security practices

33
00:01:34,132 --> 00:01:35,627
were really, really bad.

34
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:37,660
And they had, in some cases,

35
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,264
no authentication whatsoever

36
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:41,066
if you wanted to log in and get

37
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,297
on their back-end system, where all their customer data was.

38
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:44,957
So, it was really, really bad.

39
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:47,923
And the FTC forced them to hire an independent,

40
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:49,528
outside security expert

41
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:51,957
to come up with a list of all the things

42
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:55,923
they were doing wrong and then supervise them fixing it.

43
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:58,198
This took place over the course of a year,

44
00:01:58,198 --> 00:02:01,693
where I would visit all the different facilities

45
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:04,264
that they had, talk to their I.T. people,

46
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:07,297
and then afterwards, when they tried to fix everything,

47
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:08,824
went back and did another round

48
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,363
and then wrote a report about it.

49
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,726
And so I learned a lot about what it was like to do

50
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:15,429
a security evaluation and just how bad

51
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:19,198
some actual production I.T. systems really are.

52
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:21,264
So, as a result of that experience,

53
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:23,429
I decided that that was fun,

54
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:27,726
and I founded a company to do security evaluations

55
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:30,000
and started hiring former students

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,825
from the lab and from Hopkins

57
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:33,231
and from other places.

58
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:35,528
And what we would do is we would go into companies,

59
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:37,626
and, just like what I did for that rental-car company,

60
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:40,660
we would look at their I.T., we would interview them,

61
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,528
and then we would make recommendations,

62
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:46,197
and sometimes we would even be hired to help them fix them.

63
00:02:46,198 --> 00:02:47,891
And we worked in different sectors,

64
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:50,626
and so we kind of got to know what these sectors were like.

65
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,000
In the financial sector,

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,693
we found that usually the companies were pretty good.

67
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,693
That's where the money was, and they put a lot of effort

68
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:58,231
into securing their systems.

69
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,561
And so when we came in

70
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:02,660
and we looked at their systems, we had some suggestions,

71
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,396
but it wasn't like we were starting from scratch.

72
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,957
In the retail sector, we had a few customers,

73
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:10,198
and we found that things actually

74
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:12,462
weren't so good usually.

75
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:14,692
In fact, one of our big customers

76
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,660
-- I won't tell you which -- ended up being one of the ones

77
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,231
that had a famous breach.

78
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,429
It wasn't our fault, I assure you.

79
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:24,660
And we worked also in the software-security industry.

80
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,099
A lot of our clients were companies

81
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:28,297
that you would see in the booths

82
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:29,825
at the RSA Conference,

83
00:03:29,825 --> 00:03:32,000
and we would basically go in

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,759
and try to find bugs in their system

85
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,065
and try to make recommendations

86
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,924
for them to improve their products.

87
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:40,561
And finally, we worked in the health-care sector.

88
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:42,891
And when we had jobs in the health-care sector,

89
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,692
we found that that was the absolute worst sector,

90
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,165
in terms of their security.

91
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:49,626
If you think about it, that's pretty bad

92
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:53,198
because we all interact with the health-care systems, right?

93
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:55,561
Sadly but true, we all have to go to the doctor.

94
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,099
We all sometimes go to the hospital.

95
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,263
People that are close to us go there.

96
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:02,198
And yet their data-security practices

97
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,528
were so far below every other industry

98
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,759
that we saw.

99
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,494
So, I decided a few years later,

100
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:10,099
in 2009,

101
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:12,165
when I'd been working on e-voting for a long time,

102
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:14,363
that I wanted to do research in this area.

103
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:15,693
There's a lot of low-hanging fruit,

104
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,000
but there was also some very,

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,957
very interesting research problems.

106
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:22,858
And to do that, I did what I was calling

107
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:25,033
the I.T. tour of the hospitals.

108
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:27,858
So, I had access to Johns Hopkins' departments,

109
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,330
but also I had some relationships

110
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,561
in Philadelphia -- The Children's Hospital.

111
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,924
And I went to six different hospitals

112
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:38,066
and got the I.T. tour, where I would go around

113
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:39,924
with either a system administrator --

114
00:04:39,924 --> 00:04:42,395
or, in one case, the chief information security officer

115
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,594
for the hospital --

116
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:45,957
and spent a day looking at all of their systems.

117
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:48,396
In one of the hospitals, I saw a robot

118
00:04:48,396 --> 00:04:50,528
that dispensed medications.

119
00:04:50,528 --> 00:04:53,165
It's a big room with lots of little shelves,

120
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:55,825
and each one has a different drug in it.

121
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:59,527
And the robot arm would reach out, pull it,

122
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:02,363
count out a dosage somehow, get it into a little device,

123
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:03,726
and it was like a big Rube Goldberg,

124
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:06,066
where things were sliding down into little bins.

125
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,296
And in the end, a nurse

126
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:09,957
would come and take a cart with all of these things

127
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:11,330
that had the names

128
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,594
and the room numbers of the patients

129
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:14,627
and all the medications that they needed.

130
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:16,462
And I was thinking, "Wow, you know,

131
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:18,726
that thing is controlled by software.

132
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:20,891
And what if something went wrong with that software?

133
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,330
What if there was an attack that changed what it was doing?"

134
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,890
Fortunately, they have protocols

135
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:29,231
where they manually check that the pills are correct.

136
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,792
But imagine what would happen

137
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:34,462
if somebody were

138
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:37,164
to attack the system

139
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:39,627
and cause all the drugs to be wrong.

140
00:05:39,627 --> 00:05:41,165
And that would potentially be noticed,

141
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:42,924
but people have to take the medications

142
00:05:42,924 --> 00:05:44,198
by a certain time.

143
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:47,594
And if suddenly you had 1,000 people,

144
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:49,264
you know, not getting their medication

145
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:51,759
because of this mix-up, that would be really bad.

146
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,693
So, a denial-of-service attack would be a problem.

147
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:59,627
I also found so many different things about security

148
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:02,396
that were being done wrong that I was completely shocked,

149
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,033
and I'll tell you a couple of them.

150
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:06,462
One is that in one of the hospitals,

151
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:09,726
there were 8,000 employees at every different level.

152
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,660
Every single one of those employees

153
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,033
had exactly the same access

154
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:15,891
to all of the medical records

155
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,396
in the system as every other employee.

156
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:19,957
So, there was a doctor

157
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:23,033
who did not go to that hospital for treatment,

158
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,165
even though it was the best hospital around,

159
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:27,297
because he didn't want his colleagues and his coworkers

160
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:29,858
to have access to his personal information

161
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:32,000
about his medical care.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,660
I also discovered that,

163
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,924
in the radiology department in one place, there was a nurse

164
00:06:37,924 --> 00:06:41,792
whose job it was to walk around to every work station

165
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,594
every 45 minutes

166
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:46,759
because there was a 50-minute time-out on the password

167
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,132
if a doctor typed a password into the system.

168
00:06:49,132 --> 00:06:51,891
And she was supposed to type in the password for that doctor.

169
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,858
That was one of her tasks.

170
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:56,033
And so in this big room full of terminals,

171
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,165
all of them had the doctors logged into them

172
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:00,660
because this nurse was going around logging them in.

173
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,891
So, they're bypassing the security.

174
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:05,033
I mean, it's completely ridiculous to do this,

175
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,759
and yet -- I'm not making this up --

176
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,528
that really happened.

177
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,924
Another thing that I discovered was

178
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:12,495
that there was a doctor

179
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,033
who said that he liked to work from home

180
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,066
when he had to do a lot of work with the medical records

181
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,561
and wasn't seeing patients.

182
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:20,363
And I said, "So, how do you get access to the system?"

183
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:22,231
He says, "Well, I have a VPN.

184
00:07:22,231 --> 00:07:23,627
I VPN into the hospital,

185
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:25,165
and I get access to the records."

186
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,165
And I said, "So, you have a dedicated computer

187
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,792
that you only use for that." He's like, "Well, yeah,

188
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,857
unless my kids are playing games on it."

189
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:33,066
So, their kids were using this to play

190
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:35,462
whatever games they were using, browse the web,

191
00:07:35,462 --> 00:07:37,858
and then he was getting on there and VPN'ing

192
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,660
in and getting access to all the medical records

193
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,000
in the hospital.

194
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,924
And it actually took me a while

195
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:45,330
to explain to him why this was a bad idea.

196
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,495
Totally didn't get it.

197
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:51,759
So, the most egregious thing I saw

198
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,231
and where I would see the most potential

199
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:56,264
if I was an attacker had to do with the X-ray room.

200
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,066
So, I go into this hospital

201
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,924
and there's this huge room and it's completely empty

202
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:03,792
except there's a big computer in the middle of it.

203
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,594
And there are all these empty shelves.

204
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:06,825
And I say, "What is this?"

205
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:08,132
He said, "Well, we used to keep all the films

206
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:09,891
from all the X-rays in this room,

207
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,495
but we don't use those anymore.

208
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:14,495
We don't have physical films. It's all done with software."

209
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:15,858
And you come in and you get an X-ray

210
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,792
and you walk out with a disk.

211
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:19,890
And since the format

212
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:21,528
that's used for X-rays

213
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:24,891
is only used in 80% of the hospitals,

214
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:27,825
you have to have some way for the other 20% of the places

215
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:31,198
you might go with this X-ray to view the X-ray.

216
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:32,857
And so the disk is loaded

217
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,065
with a viewer program that auto-runs

218
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:36,825
when you stick it into a computer

219
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:39,891
and then lets you look at the X-ray.

220
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,593
And so I thought, "Well, here's a problem, right?

221
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:45,693
This hospital is manufacturing all these disks

222
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:48,132
that are being taken to other medical institutions

223
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,560
and being stuck in doctors' Windows machines,

224
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:52,924
which are auto-running whatever software's on there,

225
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:54,264
completely trusting it,

226
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:56,561
and getting access to their internal network."

227
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:59,363
And I thought, you know, one place to attack

228
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:02,165
would be that machine that writes those disks.

229
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:03,759
You write some malware on there,

230
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,660
you can get a virus to get into all of these different systems.

231
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,660
And I also asked doctors

232
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,759
if they take disks from patients

233
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,330
and they put them in a special machine

234
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,957
that's isolated from the rest of their system.

235
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:16,858
And they said, "No, I put it into my desktop,

236
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:18,098
where I do all my work."

237
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,000
And so the hygiene

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,495
in these systems is absolutely horrible.

239
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,000
Another thing that I found out

240
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,429
is that one of the avenues

241
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:31,495
that attacks are occurring to medical systems

242
00:09:31,495 --> 00:09:33,594
is through medical devices

243
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:35,660
like a blood gas analyzer.

244
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,791
So, there was a story about -- what is a blood gas analyzer?

245
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,330
I have no idea.

246
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,627
But it's running Windows,

247
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:44,363
and all of the systems

248
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,495
that are scanning for malware,

249
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,825
for viruses

250
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:50,330
on this hospital's network

251
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,033
were not looking at the blood gas analyzer.

252
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,792
So, what would happen is, this device

253
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,891
would get infected with something,

254
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,329
infect the rest of the network,

255
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,924
then they would clean it up, and the next day,

256
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:01,858
everything would be infected, and they wouldn't know why.

257
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:04,296
And it's because they weren't scanning the medical devices.

258
00:10:04,297 --> 00:10:07,462
They were only scanning the desktops.

259
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:12,495
There are dire predictions about medical records in health care.

260
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,495
And one of the things

261
00:10:14,495 --> 00:10:17,033
that I was asked by some of my colleagues

262
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,528
when I announced that I was going to be studying security

263
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:21,297
and health care is, "Well,

264
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:22,858
how is that any different

265
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:25,693
from security in any other field, right?

266
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,462
I mean, you do security for voting.

267
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:29,132
You do security for banking.

268
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:30,891
Isn't it just the same problems

269
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,791
that you're doing in health care?"

270
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:35,396
And so I made a list of differences, things

271
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:36,791
that are unique to health care,

272
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:39,297
which I think is actually very, very different

273
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:42,297
from doing security work in other fields.

274
00:10:42,297 --> 00:10:44,561
First off, you start with the doctors.

275
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,594
I have some friends who are doctors.

276
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:48,825
And there's a certain --

277
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,297
I guess the word would be "arrogance"

278
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:52,132
that goes along with doctors.

279
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:54,363
And they don't like to be told how to do things,

280
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,297
and they don't like to be told, "You know,

281
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:57,792
this thing that you used to do that took

282
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,924
5 minutes is now gonna take 10 minutes."

283
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,297
In fact, I got into a bit of a discussion

284
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:04,825
with one of my personal friends who's a doctor.

285
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:06,891
And he raised his finger, and he says, "The day

286
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:09,759
that you security guys kill one of my patients is the day

287
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,066
we will be able to start ignoring you guys."

288
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,396
Okay?

289
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:15,065
So, it's not like they want us to help them, right?

290
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,627
They have a huge problem,

291
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:19,132
but as far as they're concerned, they haven't been attacked,

292
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:21,263
there's no big problem, and they're in charge.

293
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,165
That's tough to deal with. Then you've got patients.

294
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:26,858
Patients don't always follow directions.

295
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,891
We're all patients. We're probably the patients

296
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:30,429
that follow the directions,

297
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,264
and the other 99% of patients probably aren't as good,

298
00:11:33,264 --> 00:11:35,825
especially as things get much more sophisticated

299
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,528
with online patient portals

300
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:39,528
and smart pillboxes

301
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:41,561
and all these other kind of things.

302
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:43,000
You've got a whole bunch of staff.

303
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,594
You've got the nurses, the clinical staff,

304
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:47,363
and they're all trying to do their job

305
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:49,396
in the face of these doctors who are in charge

306
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:51,329
and these patients who don't listen.

307
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,759
And you've got then the regulators, okay?

308
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,924
Very few industries --

309
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,593
Maybe the financial is another one,

310
00:11:56,594 --> 00:12:00,330
but very few other industries are as regulated as health care.

311
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,231
And the regulators are well-meaning mostly,

312
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:05,000
but they don't often understand

313
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,957
the implications of the things that they do.

314
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:08,660
And you can look at the recent legislation

315
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,264
as an example of that.

316
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:14,561
The administration says, "Okay, we need to regulate security.

317
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:16,726
So, I know how we can fix all the security problems

318
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:18,363
in the world. We'll just have everybody

319
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,462
tell everybody else when they're hacked, okay?

320
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:22,066
That's basically what it amounts to.

321
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:23,858
We're gonna share information."

322
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:25,824
Then you've got insurance companies.

323
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:29,198
Their goal seems to be to spend as little money as possible.

324
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:30,462
And you've got

325
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:32,363
the medical-device manufacturers,

326
00:12:32,363 --> 00:12:33,660
who are entrepreneurs

327
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,693
and trying to build things and get them out there,

328
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:37,759
but they have to deal with the FDA.

329
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,363
And imagine you get a device,

330
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:41,924
and it goes for FDA approval.

331
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:44,627
It gets FDA approval after three months.

332
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:45,891
And then there's a major hack,

333
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,462
and there's a problem discovered.

334
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:49,495
And now are they able to fix it

335
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:51,957
and still be FDA-approved?

336
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:53,528
So, these are some of the kind of issues

337
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:56,495
that we have to deal with in health care.

338
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:58,132
health-care applications are getting more

339
00:12:58,132 --> 00:12:59,593
and more complex.

340
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:01,000
Think about this --

341
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,858
a medical database has to be available all the time

342
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:06,363
because now patients are getting access

343
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:08,462
to their database, to their data, right?

344
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:10,098
So, I'm a patient. I log in.

345
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,957
I want to see my medical records from my last doctor's visit.

346
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:16,627
The medical-record provider is being told,

347
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:18,726
"You have to encrypt all of your records."

348
00:13:18,726 --> 00:13:20,231
And then they're being told, "Not only

349
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:22,033
do you have to encrypt all of your records,

350
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:23,297
but the patients have to be able

351
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:25,231
to get to them anytime they want."

352
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:27,264
Okay, when the patient goes to get to the record,

353
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,726
that record has to be decrypted,

354
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,363
or the patient won't be able to read it,

355
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:32,825
which means you have to have the key sitting over there.

356
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:35,198
And you've got key-distribution problems.

357
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:38,561
And on top of that, people want to access

358
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,627
from every mobile device that they have.

359
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:42,858
And the data's being stored in the cloud,

360
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,494
which means that the owner of the data

361
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:47,363
is actually not managing the data themselves.

362
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:49,132
Cloud-service providers are subject

363
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:52,627
to side-channel attacks and other kind of issues.

364
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:54,132
And now that industry

365
00:13:54,132 --> 00:13:56,065
hasn't even been regulated very much.

366
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,561
They're dealing with HIPAA

367
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,858
and having to figure out, "Okay, well, on these servers,

368
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,165
I'm gonna be storing medical data.

369
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,891
Do I need separate protocols for that?"

370
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:05,296
And one of the key points

371
00:14:05,297 --> 00:14:08,891
is that all of this information, all this health information,

372
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,527
is being controlled by software.

373
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:13,594
What's being controlled by software?

374
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:14,957
Well, I made a short list

375
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:17,495
of things that are controlled by software.

376
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:19,924
Technical people know that software is buggy.

377
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,198
There's no way to avoid it.

378
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:23,363
We're never gonna have perfect software.

379
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,066
And software controls things like radiation dosage,

380
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,528
dosage of medication in an infusion pump.

381
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:30,825
In fact, infusion pumps

382
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:33,198
which are hooked up to people and administer medicines

383
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:34,891
are now being hooked up to the Internet

384
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:37,198
and have been for some time now.

385
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:38,759
The amount of supplies

386
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,891
that are stocked in the intensive-care unit.

387
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:43,791
I learned this in a neonatal unit at a hospital,

388
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:48,396
that the lives of babies are determined

389
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:51,891
and are dependent on them getting sponges, clamps,

390
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,891
all of these things at the right time.

391
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:57,198
That's all controlled by a distributed-computing system.

392
00:14:57,198 --> 00:14:59,000
And the doctor working there told me

393
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,165
that if that system goes down, babies will die.

394
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:06,198
And the reason is, they used to have a paper backup system.

395
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:07,660
The system worked well enough

396
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,396
that, slowly, they stopped using it,

397
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:10,957
and they no longer use it at all.

398
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:14,396
It's all automated, and it's a distributed system.

399
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,726
That's pretty scary.

400
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:17,429
Even the shifts of the doctors

401
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:19,033
and the nurses --

402
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:20,264
and you may not think of that

403
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:22,660
as being a life-threatening avenue of attack,

404
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,693
but if all the wrong doctors

405
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:26,098
or nurses come at the wrong time,

406
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:28,660
the hospital may not be staffed well enough.

407
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,198
Obviously, the electronic health records.

408
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:33,528
I mentioned this drug-dispensing robot.

409
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:35,099
It's controlled by software.

410
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:37,627
And all the devices are now communicating.

411
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:41,231
Each one of these things that is controlled by software

412
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,792
is an avenue of threat.

413
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:47,330
It's an area where an attacker could basically cause mayhem,

414
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,891
and anything controlled by software

415
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:51,033
is potentially exploitable.

416
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,594
Now, here's a very disturbing picture.

417
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:57,198
This is a person's wrist that got injured.

418
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:58,627
It got burned.

419
00:15:58,627 --> 00:16:00,263
And the way it happened was,

420
00:16:00,264 --> 00:16:02,198
this person was wearing a fitness tracker,

421
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:03,561
like a Fitbit.

422
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,891
And that device had a bug in the software

423
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,429
that caused the sensors to go a little haywire

424
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:12,528
and it was over-sampling and that caused this burn.

425
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:15,660
Now, imagine -- That's something that happened by accident.

426
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,726
What could you do intentionally?

427
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,066
And as I'm contemplating that,

428
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:20,825
I come up with this article that says,

429
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:23,429
"Hackers can wirelessly upload malware to a Fitbit

430
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,759
in 10 seconds."

431
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,726
So, this really could happen.

432
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:29,924
One other story is, I bought a blood-pressure

433
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,891
monitor to take my blood pressure at home.

434
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,329
It seemed whenever I go to the hospital

435
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,000
to have my blood pressure taken or the doctor's office,

436
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I have a disease called white coat syndrome,

437
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,693
and my blood pressure's off the charts.

438
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:42,033
And so they said, "Well, try taking it at home."

439
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,231
The device is hooked up to a phone,

440
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:46,429
and that's the interface for it.

441
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:48,759
And as it started to tighten on my arm,

442
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,033
I felt like my arm was gonna fall off.

443
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:53,099
And needless to say, by the time it was done,

444
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:56,330
the blood reading said I had two minutes to live.

445
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,033
But it turned out it was just me being scared of this.

446
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:01,066
But it's controlled by software on the phone.

447
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:02,660
If my iPhone gets hacked,

448
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,494
that could basically result in me losing an arm.

449
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:07,890
A lot of other devices

450
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,594
are being hooked into people,

451
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:12,198
and we're going to see more and more convergence

452
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,429
of things controlled by software being part of people

453
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:17,660
and affecting your daily health.

454
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,792
So, all I've done up till now is say bad things --

455
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,297
"Health care is really dangerous.

456
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,033
We're all in trouble" -- and I thought,

457
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:25,032
"I have to give some constructive advice,

458
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:26,858
like, 'What can we do to fix it?

459
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:30,099
'" And when I was a kid, I loved watching David Letterman.

460
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:33,033
And for those young people, that's like Stephen Colbert,

461
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:36,561
but not as witty and not as funny.

462
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:38,528
And I said, "What are the top 10 things

463
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,759
we can do to get the biggest bang for the buck?"

464
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,099
-- meaning the least amount

465
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,197
of effort to get the most benefit.

466
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:47,429
And these aren't in order. They're just the top 10.

467
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:50,891
And the first thing is, a medical device

468
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:53,561
should run the application that it was intended for, right?

469
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,330
A PACS radiology system

470
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,033
should run radiology software and nothing else.

471
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,561
So, let's white-list applications

472
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:03,462
and only run the things that should run on a device.

473
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:06,033
Number 2 -- let's do the things

474
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:08,561
we know how to do to protect the back-end systems, okay?

475
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:09,858
We know how to do virus scanning.

476
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:11,956
We know all kinds of hygiene,

477
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,693
but we're not doing it in the health-care systems.

478
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:17,627
Another thing is, if you get a query

479
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,000
on a medical database

480
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,858
for records number 5 through 20,000,

481
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:23,924
that's not a legitimate query.

482
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:26,726
We need to start profiling the queries

483
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,891
and say, "Let's not allow queries that are illegitimate.

484
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:33,726
Let's raise alarms, et cetera."

485
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:35,693
It's obvious to a lot of security people,

486
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,924
but multifactor authentication exists,

487
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:40,165
and in terms of bang for the buck, that's something

488
00:18:40,165 --> 00:18:43,956
we need to start doing in the health care I.T.

489
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,462
Remember I talked about the doctor

490
00:18:45,462 --> 00:18:47,132
who went home and used his computer

491
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:49,297
and then his kids were playing games on there?

492
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:54,198
What we really should do is say, "Why not have a virtual machine

493
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,693
install something like VMware on your home machine,

494
00:18:56,693 --> 00:19:00,528
open up a version of your system to access the records,

495
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:02,594
then pause that virtual machine.

496
00:19:02,594 --> 00:19:04,594
Your kids can open up another virtual machine."

497
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:06,627
If you don't have the money to buy two computers,

498
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:08,759
you should at least be able to isolate these things.

499
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,957
It's not perfect security,

500
00:19:09,957 --> 00:19:11,594
but in terms of bang for the buck,

501
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:14,561
I think it's huge.

502
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:19,231
Encrypted the data! Okay?

503
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:20,231
[ Laughter ]

504
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:22,264
[ Chuckles ]

505
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:25,593
In terms of the cloud providers, there are these things

506
00:19:25,594 --> 00:19:28,561
called health information exchanges, HIEs.

507
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:30,264
They allow you to go from one hospital

508
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:33,000
to another hospital because they're sharing all their data.

509
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,231
But one of the problems is they get bogged down

510
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:37,429
with lawyers and with all these legal problems

511
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:40,561
whenever somebody new tries to enter,

512
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,659
a new hospital tries to enter or a new HIE tries to enter.

513
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,759
If somebody were to standardize a legal agreement

514
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,165
between cloud-service providers

515
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,627
who are storing medical data

516
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:50,000
and health information exchanges,

517
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,231
things would flow very seamlessly.

518
00:19:53,231 --> 00:19:55,957
We also need to control access control

519
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:57,594
for chart accesses,

520
00:19:57,594 --> 00:20:00,198
and we need to log and get accountability

521
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:04,396
whenever there's an access of a chart.

522
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:06,890
When the data itself identifies itself,

523
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,198
like genomic data,

524
00:20:08,198 --> 00:20:10,330
it's very difficult to anonymize it.

525
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,858
This is more like a big bang and big buck

526
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,330
because I don't know how to do this,

527
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,462
and it's an area I recommend that research happens.

528
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:19,396
Now, David Letterman would usually get a drum roll

529
00:20:19,396 --> 00:20:22,066
before the last one, so can we hear a little...

530
00:20:22,066 --> 00:20:24,726
It's actually not the -- It's not the last one.

531
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:26,033
This is just the --

532
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,362
It's not, like, bigger than the others.

533
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:28,759
It's just the last one.

534
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,627
We need to authenticate clinical personnel.

535
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,297
And this could be something

536
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:36,528
via, like, smart badges with RFID, proximity sensors,

537
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,924
which would give you one factor when you get close --

538
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:40,231
because the way they're doing it today is

539
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:43,660
with a nurse who goes around and authenticates people.

540
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,396
So, my final thoughts are

541
00:20:45,396 --> 00:20:48,231
that the health-care sector is unique.

542
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:50,132
It's a unique regulatory environment.

543
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:52,297
We have different stakeholders.

544
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,330
We depend a lot on software.

545
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,231
And it does affect all of us personally

546
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:58,495
because we, at some point,

547
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,033
are going to have to deal with the medical system.

548
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:04,726
So, we need to consider the security implications

549
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:06,231
of new technologies.

550
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,297
Thank you very much. [ Applause ]

551
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:07,297
