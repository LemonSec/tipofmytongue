1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:05,132


2
00:00:05,132 --> 00:00:07,066
STEPANOVICH: All right,
hey, everybody.

3
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:09,065
Thank you so much
for having me here today

4
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:11,033
and for sticking
out the entire conference

5
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:12,857
to hear what I have to say.

6
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,495
I am really grateful
to be here today

7
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:17,330
because it means I am not
back in Washington, DC,

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,825
under many feet of snow,

9
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:21,462
so I doubly thank you for that.

10
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:23,000
My name is Amie Stepanovich.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,495
I am a US Policy Manager
at Access Now.

12
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,231
My contact information
is on the screen behind me.

13
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,891
It will come up again
at the end.

14
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:31,363
If you have any questions
and you don't get

15
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,759
to ask them today, please
feel free to reach out,

16
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,099
and I will try
to get back with you.

17
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:40,000
So, just to digress for a second
before we start,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,297
Access Now is a global nonprofit
civil-society organization.

19
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:48,461
Our mission is to defend
and extend the rights of users

20
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:50,231
at risk around the world.

21
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,891
What that means is
that my colleagues

22
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:54,461
and I at six different
offices globally

23
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:57,627
and several satellite
presences work --

24
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:02,693
do a three-pronged method
to solve the problems

25
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:04,330
of the users
who are most at risk,

26
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,033
which we've heard
quite a bit about, namely

27
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,462
from Morgan and Eva
a little bit earlier.

28
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:10,825
So, we do this through
technology solutions,

29
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:14,132
policy solutions,
and advocacy work.

30
00:01:14,132 --> 00:01:16,660
That means that we're in a lot
of conversations

31
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,594
with high-ranking
government officials

32
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:20,693
and corporate executives

33
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:22,527
about how laws and policies

34
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:25,165
are going to impact
the human rights abusers.

35
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,528
We also run a 24-hour-a-day,

36
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:30,264
7-day-a-week digital
security help line

37
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:33,264
where activists and journalists
can e-mail into us

38
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:34,627
and have technologists answer

39
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,857
some of the questions
about the threats

40
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:39,033
that they are facing
in their everyday work

41
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,396
on the ground.

42
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:42,759
So, I'm gonna tell you today

43
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,396
a few crypto stories
to tell in the dark,

44
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,858
and my first story is maybe
a little more of a parable

45
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,330
than a story.

46
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,363
It's about Juniper Networks.
So, last year,

47
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,924
late last year,
it was revealed --

48
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:57,297
Juniper revealed that
there were two vulnerabilities

49
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,527
in one of their software suites.

50
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:03,627
One of the vulnerabilities was
the result of Dual EC --

51
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:07,297
the use of a random-number
generator called Dual EC.

52
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:09,264
This is really important.

53
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:10,726
NIST --

54
00:02:10,726 --> 00:02:12,924
the National Institute
for Standards and Technology,

55
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,957
in 2013, had actually
recommended

56
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:18,858
against the continued use
of Dual EC.

57
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,429
They had generated the standard.

58
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:21,924
They said
that it could be engineered

59
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:23,759
to allow for a back door.

60
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,263
So, the technical questions

61
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:29,363
about why Juniper still
decided to use Dual EC,

62
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:32,759
about how they implemented it,
there are extensive --

63
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,329
A lot of minds
that are much more

64
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,891
technically inclined
than mine is as a lawyer

65
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:40,033
and a policy analyst
have dove into this.

66
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,560
If you're interested in that,
I suggest you look it up.

67
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:45,066
But the result --

68
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,957
the result of that vulnerability

69
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,528
was that any information

70
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:51,495
that was sent over VPN that
used the vulnerability

71
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:53,330
that was collected
by other government

72
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,231
or a malicious actor
could now be decrypted.

73
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:59,626
And so we'll get into the causes
a little bit later,

74
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:03,264
but the moral
of the story

75
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:06,858
is that security is really,
really insanely hard.

76
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:09,594
I heard Jan say
earlier no product ships

77
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:12,099
without a vulnerability.

78
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,857
The security game
is stacked against us.

79
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,924
We only need to have
one vulnerability

80
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:18,297
for a bad actor
to take advantage.

81
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:19,627
Those of us playing defense,

82
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:22,297
we have to get everything
exactly right,

83
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:23,594
and that's really difficult

84
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,924
when you're trying
to get it exactly right.

85
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:29,099
When you're being forced
to put in vulnerabilities,

86
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,329
you're much more at risk
of putting the users

87
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,693
that are going
to use your products

88
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:37,198
in a really bad situation.

89
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:39,891
Encryption is basically,
for those of you who don't know,

90
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:43,462
the math that protects
our digital information.

91
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:47,231
It's sometimes demonized
in the media

92
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:50,099
as something the terrorists use
or something for bad people,

93
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,759
but really,
if you're using encryption,

94
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,957
it might mean that
you just have an iPhone,

95
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:56,957
or that you do online banking,

96
00:03:56,957 --> 00:04:00,759
or that you're using WhatsApp
and you have a WhatsApp account.

97
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,857
Quick show of hands,
does anybody in here think

98
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:06,561
that they do not use encryption
on a daily basis?

99
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:07,627
Anybody?

100
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,462
I'm seeing
absolutely zero hands.

101
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:12,099
Yes, you are probably all right.

102
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,363
You do use encryption
every single day.

103
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:18,264
In fact, recently,
in a really great report

104
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:20,792
by some of the top
cryptographers of our time,

105
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,032
it was said
that to undermine encryption

106
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,528
would be to force a U-turn

107
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:27,429
in the best practices,
the security best practices.

108
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:30,198
It would add
much more complexity

109
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:32,198
to security systems,

110
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:33,726
and it would create
a huge target

111
00:04:33,726 --> 00:04:37,297
for bad actors to go after.

112
00:04:37,297 --> 00:04:39,957
Encryption also
protects human rights.

113
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:42,659
In a wonderful, groundbreaking,
miraculous report

114
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,561
that was released
last year by David K.,

115
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:46,198
who, for those of you
who don't know,

116
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,296
is the United Nations
Special Repertoire

117
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:49,924
for Freedom of Expression,

118
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:51,164
he explained at length

119
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,528
how encryption software
and software

120
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:57,594
that supports anonymity
are actually absolutely vital

121
00:04:57,594 --> 00:05:00,594
to the exercise of freedom
of speech, and by extension,

122
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:02,825
to the exercise
of your privacy rights.

123
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:08,231
Encryption and human rights are
just inexplicably intertwined.

124
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,495
To relate this to the people
at the ground level,

125
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:12,000
encryption means that people,

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,198
LGBT activists
in the Middle East

127
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:16,000
and North Africa,
the MENA region,

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,330
can protect themselves
against government persecution.

129
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,099
By contrast,
a couple years ago

130
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,396
or a year ago,
a citizen activist

131
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:27,363
in Mexico who had been
tweeting about cartel --

132
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:28,825
drug cartel activity

133
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:31,429
was actually murdered
when her phone was compromised

134
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:34,198
and the cartels were able
to link her specifically

135
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:35,957
to an account

136
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:39,726
they had put
a hit out on.

137
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:41,627
So, crypto, encryption,

138
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:43,627
especially
really strong encryption,

139
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,363
enabled by default,

140
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:48,396
we found is necessary
to ensure the continued safety

141
00:05:48,396 --> 00:05:51,924
for the users
who are most at risk.

142
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:55,527
But the problem is is that
this all gets really complicated

143
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,759
when governments
start getting involved.

144
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,099
Governments want access to data.
Now, that could be different

145
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,000
depending on the government
that we're talking about.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,726
Some governments want mass
access to all of your data.

147
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:08,891
Some only want it
in certain investigations

148
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:11,363
in a targeted manner.
Some want both.

149
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:13,594
Some governments
put in place more

150
00:06:13,594 --> 00:06:14,957
due process procedures

151
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,462
or more privacy protections
against getting your data.

152
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:19,726
But no matter what,
all governments

153
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:23,000
want some form
of access to data.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,363
And this means that encryption
is getting in their way,

155
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:27,726
because the strongest types

156
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:29,660
of encryption,
end-to-end encryption --

157
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,792
or what I like to call
end-to-end encryption,

158
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,395
which is real
end-to-end encryption --

159
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:37,429
and device encryption
sometimes is designed in a way

160
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,429
that doesn't allow
law enforcement

161
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:41,626
to get the access
that they want.

162
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:43,957
So in that sense,
they say they are going "dark."

163
00:06:43,957 --> 00:06:48,330
Many of you might have heard
the term from people in the US

164
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,429
government specifically saying
that they are going dark.

165
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:51,000
and what does that mean?

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,198
It means that they have --

167
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:54,296
much like I am
right now on this stage --

168
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:57,396
been staring in the digital
transition from paper

169
00:06:57,396 --> 00:07:00,330
to digital at a supernova

170
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,363
of data, this huge,
bright, wonderful,

171
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:08,033
beaming circle of data
that we are all generating.

172
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,462
No matter what website we visit,

173
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,099
no matter
what store we go to,

174
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,132
we're creating data
all the time

175
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,693
in a way that we have never
in the history of mankind

176
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:17,594
created data before.

177
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:19,296
And encryption is starting

178
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:21,297
to turn that down just
ever so slightly.

179
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:23,363
They're putting a little,
tiny, black spot

180
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:25,792
in this supernova of data.

181
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,032
And only certain types of data.

182
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,297
Let's remember
that metadata

183
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:31,495
is not necessarily
encryptable at this moment,

184
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,330
or at least not
easily encryptable,

185
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,000
although we can obfuscate it.

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,957
And so it really is
only certain types of data

187
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,561
and we're only turning it down
ever so slightly.

188
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:43,825
But this is a problem
for law enforcement.

189
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:45,924
To combat this,
governments

190
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,659
have gotten really inventive
at coming up with ways

191
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,066
in order to fight encryption.

192
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,231
The first one
and probably the most extreme

193
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:56,891
is by outright banning
the use of encryption.

194
00:07:56,891 --> 00:08:00,825
Alternatively, they have limited
the exports of certain types

195
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:04,659
or strengths of encryption,
most famously in the US.

196
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,297
In fact, export controls
on encryption going into

197
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:10,066
the '90s
are largely believed

198
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,330
to be responsible
for the FREAK bug

199
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,858
that was uncovered
in early 2015.

200
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,561
Other ways that they do this are
through the insertion,

201
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:20,395
the mandatory insertion
of back doors

202
00:08:20,396 --> 00:08:22,264
or golden keys
or vulnerabilities,

203
00:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,726
whatever you really
want to call them,

204
00:08:24,726 --> 00:08:26,198
or through key escrow systems

205
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:28,726
that create large,
bright, glowing targets

206
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:31,825
for bad actors
to go after.

207
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,098
Getting back
to the Dual EC conversation

208
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,528
we had at the beginning,

209
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:38,363
governments can also go
after encryption standards.

210
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:40,693
So, the reason
that Dual EC

211
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:43,528
has this weird vulnerability
piece to it,

212
00:08:43,528 --> 00:08:44,759
largely believed,

213
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,462
is because the NSA
made it happen.

214
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,462
NIST, again, the agency

215
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:54,033
that created Dual EC
is required by US law

216
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,660
to consult with the NSA

217
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,759
and their amazing array
of cryptographers

218
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,858
when they create
encryption standards.

219
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:01,296
And this was envisioned as a way

220
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,825
to make sure that we had
the best standards.

221
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:05,561
But NSA really wants to be able

222
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,429
to continue
conducting surveillance,

223
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:09,924
so they don't want
a standard to be so great

224
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,660
that they can't get past it.

225
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,627
And this is a problem
when you house the lock breakers

226
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:17,593
in the same house
or in, figuratively,

227
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:19,891
the same house
as the lock makers.

228
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:23,560
Eventually, one of the missions
is going to win out.

229
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:25,924
Finally, a lot
of these different things

230
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:28,066
can be implemented
not necessarily through mandate,

231
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:30,000
but through
pressuring companies,

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,297
and you would have had
to be living in a box

233
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:34,330
or maybe an igloo
in Washington, DC,

234
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,000
to have missed this playing out
in real time right now.

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,891
Has anybody seen a headline
or a news story

236
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:43,231
over the past month
or so linking encryption

237
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:46,660
to the terrorist attacks
in San Bernardino or in Paris?

238
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,396
Anybody?
It's about half of you.

239
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:53,363
So, law enforcement
is increasingly tying --

240
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:55,462
or people in law enforcement,
people in Congress,

241
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,660
people all over the world

242
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,329
are increasingly
tying encryption

243
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,429
to bad actors
and to violent attacks

244
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:02,858
and to loss of life.

245
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:06,263
And they are doing this in order
to pressure companies to stop

246
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:08,099
using certain types
of encryption

247
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:11,858
that they feel like
they cannot get around.

248
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,693
Which brings me
to the central point

249
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:18,264
of this talk -- the UK
wants to own the Internet.

250
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:20,330
Late last year,
the United Kingdom

251
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,891
put out a draft
Investigatory Powers bill,

252
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,296
or IP bill,
as we call them in DC,

253
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:28,363
because in DC, we love acronyms.

254
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:30,264
The bill is largely intended

255
00:10:30,264 --> 00:10:33,495
to replace all existing
surveillance law in the UK

256
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:35,099
and to upgrade that law

257
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,726
for the modern age,
which, in regular terms,

258
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:41,099
means to expand it and give them
a lot more authority.

259
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,000
One of the provisions --
there are a lot

260
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,363
of troubling provisions
in this law.

261
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,759
It's not a wonderful law.

262
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,066
In fact, Access Now,

263
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,660
other organizations like the
Electronic Frontier Foundation,

264
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,065
have filed comments with

265
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:56,099
multiple different committees
in the United Kingdom.

266
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:57,462
Companies
like Apple and Google

267
00:10:57,462 --> 00:11:00,593
have also filed comments saying
all of the different ways

268
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:01,957
that this law
violates human rights

269
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:05,495
and will make
security less robust.

270
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:06,924
But one
of the provisions

271
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:08,792
is basically saying

272
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,957
that the Secretary
of State in the UK can order

273
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:15,858
that companies build systems
or change systems in a way

274
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:18,791
to allow for continued access.

275
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,297
Which is bad
in its own right.

276
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,264
If this system is allowed to go
into place,

277
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,528
the Secretary of State in the UK

278
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:27,000
can effectively prevent the use
of end-to-end encryption

279
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,429
or device encryption.

280
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,396
And it's all the more
complicated

281
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:33,858
because it comes with an extra
territoriality provision,

282
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,363
which is a really long word
for saying

283
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,693
that it's not only going
to apply to companies in the UK,

284
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:42,066
but any company
that touches the UK.

285
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:45,495
And on the Internet,
that kind of means everybody.

286
00:11:45,495 --> 00:11:49,429
Because you can't really
stop touching the UK

287
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:52,363
when you're conducting
an online business.

288
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,561
And, so,
this basically means the UK

289
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:57,792
is trying to find a way
to impose their values

290
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:01,594
and their morae
on the entire world.

291
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:04,330
And this takes us down
a really dark path.

292
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,561
It gives companies effectively
only three options

293
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,462
on how to deal with this.

294
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,363
They can create a hybrid service
that serves only the UK,

295
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:14,264
which means
they have to create

296
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:16,693
and update
an entirely additional service

297
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:19,561
to the one they supply
to the rest of the world.

298
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:20,759
They can pull out of the UK

299
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,264
altogether and try
to geographically block

300
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:26,000
their service
from showing up there.

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,363
Or they can undermine
the security

302
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:30,264
that they are trying
to build into their system

303
00:12:30,264 --> 00:12:35,693
and create one weaker service
that they supply to everybody.

304
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:38,396
This is not an easy choice,
and we're going to find

305
00:12:38,396 --> 00:12:42,462
that most companies really
can only afford option three,

306
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,165
because it's
the cheapest, easiest way

307
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,231
to comply with these laws.

308
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,759
That means that
they're not going to be able

309
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,132
to compete on security
the way that we are finding

310
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:54,132
that companies have really
started to compete on security.

311
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:56,231
And they're going
to have to really fall

312
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,858
behind the larger companies

313
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:01,165
that are already cementing
their place at the top

314
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:03,627
and might be able
to afford option one

315
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:06,329
and be able to build out
an entirely second service

316
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,561
to serve some of
these customers in the UK.

317
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:11,726
In fact, we already saw
at the end of last year

318
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:13,429
a study by "USA Today"

319
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:16,429
that said
that only five companies

320
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,924
take in 70% of the revenue
on the Internet --

321
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,329
five companies.

322
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,099
And, so,
if you look at clauses

323
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:25,198
like this that are going
to require people

324
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:27,033
put a lot more money
into security,

325
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:29,660
it may only cement
that path and harm users

326
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,560
by limiting choice.

327
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,627
And this is not only a story
in the UK.

328
00:13:35,627 --> 00:13:37,858
Late last year,
a few other stories.

329
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,165
We saw China pass a law

330
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,296
that effectively prohibited
end-to-end encryption.

331
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:46,396
They wrote it in and they passed
that law in December.

332
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:47,924
The fine for companies

333
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:50,560
that commit serious violations
of this law -- so,

334
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:53,759
build a system that will not be
able to turn over data --

335
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,066
have no maximum financial limit.

336
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,264
So China can impose
any amount of fine

337
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:01,165
that they want
to against companies

338
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,593
that do not obey this law.

339
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,825
Also, last year,
Kazakhstan

340
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:07,726
decided to require users --

341
00:14:07,726 --> 00:14:09,462
all end users --

342
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:12,297
to install what they call
"National Security Certificates"

343
00:14:12,297 --> 00:14:13,693
on their computers.

344
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:16,231
This is a really fancy way
of saying we're going to require

345
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,627
you to install a vulnerability
right on your laptop.

346
00:14:19,627 --> 00:14:24,593
Supposedly, that is to allow for
telecoms in Kazakhstan

347
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:27,957
to decrypt otherwise
encrypted communications.

348
00:14:27,957 --> 00:14:29,891
This is a policy
that one telecom actually

349
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:31,593
published on its website

350
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:33,330
before "The New York Times"
went in

351
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,495
and started fishing around
and asking questions,

352
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:37,693
and then the telecom
took it down.

353
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:40,000
And, so, we really don't know
exactly the status

354
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,099
of this policy right now,

355
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:42,693
but we know
that this was in place

356
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:45,924
the last time
anybody could check.

357
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:48,528
We talked a little about what
the UK is going to do this year.

358
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:50,099
We're expecting the IP bill

359
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:52,330
to be formally introduced
sometime soon.

360
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,858
We're also going to see, likely
this year, action in India.

361
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:58,494
Last year, India put into place

362
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:01,858
a policy on encryption
that was so bad

363
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,560
and created such an outroar

364
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:07,660
that they had to withdraw it
the same day they published it.

365
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,726
The policy allowed for the use
of encryption --

366
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:12,264
please go forth
and use encryption,

367
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:14,594
you can store information
in an encrypted way --

368
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:17,396
but it required that companies
store the plaintext

369
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:18,726
of that encrypted information

370
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:21,363
right alongside
the encrypted text.

371
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:23,825
This is absolutely absurd.

372
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,264
So, the Indian government
finally recognized

373
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:27,627
that it was absurd
a few hours

374
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,858
after they published it
and they withdrew the policy,

375
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:32,660
but we're expecting
their next encryption policy

376
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,231
to be published sometime soon.

377
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:37,000
Other countries
are likely going to follow.

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,165
We could see things
from Australia or France.

379
00:15:39,165 --> 00:15:42,660
Those are areas
that we're watching.

380
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,627
And other countries
really like to use

381
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,462
the political cover
provided by countries

382
00:15:47,462 --> 00:15:49,593
that they look up to
to pass bad laws.

383
00:15:49,594 --> 00:15:51,330
We've seen this before
with data retention.

384
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,000
We've seen it with a lot
of other issues.

385
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,693
So countries
really could slide in

386
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:56,396
and try to implement
bad provisions

387
00:15:56,396 --> 00:15:58,132
just by looking
at other countries

388
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:00,231
talking about this.

389
00:16:00,231 --> 00:16:04,099
And, of course, in the US,
we have heard this all before

390
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:07,528
over and over
and over again

391
00:16:07,528 --> 00:16:09,924
from the export controls debates

392
00:16:09,924 --> 00:16:13,165
I talked about from the '70s
to the '90s, the debates

393
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:15,065
over the Clipper Chip
in the 1990s,

394
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,924
where we learned, once
and for all, we hoped,

395
00:16:17,924 --> 00:16:19,495
that there is no such thing

396
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,792
as a "secure back door,"

397
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:24,396
into the going
dark debates today.

398
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:26,858
And, finally, I think
the activists, the advocates,

399
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,560
the policy experts,
the cryptographers,

400
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:30,528
and everybody else who agreed
that the US government

401
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:34,363
needed to shut up
said that we have had enough.

402
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:37,462
Access Now, along with EFF
and some many dozen

403
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:40,132
of other organizations
and companies

404
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,098
filed a petition
with the US government

405
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:44,594
last year at savecrypto.org.

406
00:16:44,594 --> 00:16:48,363
That petition very quickly
reached and surpassed

407
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:50,429
the requisite 100,000 signatures

408
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,528
needed to compel an answer
from the U. S government

409
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,330
and get them to put into place

410
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,561
some policy on the record,
and we are awaiting

411
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,330
for that policy
to be put into place.

412
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,561
The official word right now is
they will not seek mandates

413
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:02,891
at this time.

414
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:05,000
"At this time"
being the key words.

415
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,329
And that hasn't been said
by the administration.

416
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,560
It has been said
for the administration

417
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,066
in "The New York Times"
and "The Washington Post."

418
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:15,726
So far, we've gotten
two interim responses

419
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,099
to that petition
from the government

420
00:17:17,098 --> 00:17:18,428
asking for more information,

421
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,231
asking people to supply
more examples or information

422
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:23,791
about how they use encryption,

423
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:28,428
but we haven't really had
a final, real response.

424
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:30,924
And so we're pushing
for something strong.

425
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,759
Because every different mandate,
every different hole,

426
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,330
every different vulnerability,
every different law

427
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,759
puts another hole
in the Internet ecosystem,

428
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,528
puts another hole
in our security.

429
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:42,924
And I fear that with
too many holes,

430
00:17:42,924 --> 00:17:45,231
the system is going
to collapse on itself.

431
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:48,000
And so we need a leader.
We need a strong, global leader

432
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,396
that will step in

433
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:52,363
and try to take us forward
toward a more secure Internet

434
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,066
and not a weak Internet
that we can't trust.

435
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:57,627
So, I want to leave you

436
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,956
with a little bit
of hope and positivity,

437
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:01,561
because this has been
fairly negative

438
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:04,593
and it's been a day
of a lot of scary things.

439
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:07,594
And, so, I do think that
there is hope on the horizon.

440
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:12,297
Earlier this month, Access Now,

441
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:15,396
with over 200
other organizations,

442
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,858
companies, experts,
launched SecureTheInternet.org,

443
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:20,659
which is really simple.

444
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,957
It's five tenets

445
00:18:21,957 --> 00:18:24,462
that we think have
to guide governments

446
00:18:24,462 --> 00:18:26,660
when they create
laws or policies

447
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,165
on the issue of encryption.

448
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,792
Things like, "You cannot
undermine encryption.

449
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:33,858
You cannot require back doors
to be built."

450
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:36,165
In the very short time
this website has been active,

451
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:38,462
we've already had
thousands of people

452
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:39,825
sign the letter

453
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:41,198
and add their support to it.

454
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:43,198
We've had it sent to the US
government,

455
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:44,594
to the Australian government.

456
00:18:44,594 --> 00:18:46,198
We hope soon to send it

457
00:18:46,198 --> 00:18:48,561
to the California state
government

458
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,792
because they're also proposing
some really bad laws

459
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:54,231
to put into place
that would basically prevent

460
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:58,330
sale of an iPhone
in this great state.

461
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,396
And governments are responding.

462
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:03,726
Governments are responding
in a positive way also.

463
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,726
On the screen
behind me is a statement

464
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:07,462
from the government
of the Netherlands,

465
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:09,693
where they actually
issued a report saying

466
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:12,561
that encryption was vital
to the Internet economy,

467
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,792
it's vital to security,

468
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,131
a really strong,
positive statement

469
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,660
on the use of encryption.

470
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,495
We also saw an amendment
in France knocked down,

471
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,858
but not yet out,

472
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:25,528
that would have been harmful
to the use of encryption.

473
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,693
And we're seeing, all over
the world, people

474
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:32,660
come together and really rise up
against bad laws.

475
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,462
Eva and Morgan
also talked about RightsCon

476
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,066
at the end of March,
beginning of April,

477
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:39,033
back here in San Francisco.

478
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:40,396
In conjunction
with RightsCon,

479
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:43,197
we will be holding
the second Crypto Summit.

480
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:46,396
And, so, right now, if you go
to the Crypto Summit website,

481
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:48,132
you can see the schedule
for that event,

482
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:49,660
and you can supply some comments

483
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,000
on some of the things
that we're hoping,

484
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,594
praying that the conversation
can move on to,

485
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,759
that we can get past this idea
that there can be

486
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:59,000
a secure back door, and we can
start talking about

487
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,231
other things
that governments are

488
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:02,825
trying to do
to undermine user security,

489
00:20:02,825 --> 00:20:04,759
things like government hacking,

490
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,957
so-called "equipment
interference,"

491
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,495
in government parlance,

492
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:09,858
and that we can move together,

493
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:12,000
all of us together,
toward a really good,

494
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,495
happy ending to this otherwise
really scary story.

495
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:18,131
[ Applause ]

496
