1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:05,165


2
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:06,363
[ Applause ]

3
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:07,495
-Thank you.

4
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:10,792
So, when I was a teenager,

5
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:12,693
I wanted to be a hacker.

6
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:15,759
Yeah, I know.

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,231
But I really loved computers.

8
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:19,792
I taught myself
a few programming languages.

9
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,495
I started
dual-booting Gen 2,

10
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:23,000
and I figured,
"Well, being a hacker

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,957
has got to be
the next step, right?"

12
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:26,528
But I didn't know
how to get started.

13
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:29,000
I didn't know any hackers
who could teach me

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,792
or have any resources
to teach me how to hack,

15
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:33,528
so I did the only thing I could.

16
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,231
I went online,
and I tried to --

17
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:36,726
tried to look it up.

18
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:40,461
I found lots of really, really
top-notch resources.

19
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:41,660
They had tutorials.

20
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,395
They'd teach me how to hack.

21
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:47,231
I downloaded all the tools
that all the pro hackers use.

22
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:49,726
And I spent, you know,
several months at this.

23
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:53,495
And after a little while,
I realized, well, hopefully

24
00:00:53,495 --> 00:00:55,330
what all of you already know,

25
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,231
which is, this does not work.

26
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:59,000
And so, I was sitting there.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,792
I was like,
"Well, what now?

28
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,957
I don't have anyone else
to turn to.

29
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:04,956
There's no other way for
me to learn this information,"

30
00:01:04,956 --> 00:01:07,923
and I-I gave up,
and that was it.

31
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:09,330
The end.

32
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,066
So, several years later,

33
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:13,495
I started studying
computer science

34
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:15,693
at Carnegie Mellon University.

35
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:18,396
In my freshman year,
a friend of mine came to me,

36
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:20,363
and he said, "Hey,
we just started this group

37
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:23,726
on campus called
The Plaid Parliament of Pwning.

38
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:26,825
And this weekend, we're playing
in a capture-the-flag contest.

39
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you want to join us?"

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,594
Now, being
a computer-science student

41
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:32,594
without many friends, of course
I was like, "Oh, yeah, sure.

42
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,461
I'll hang out with you guys.

43
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:37,396
But I have no idea
what capture the flag is."

44
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:39,396
So, it's actually
really simple.

45
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,528
If you're familiar
with the playground game,

46
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:42,792
it's actually the same.

47
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:47,000
The only difference is
now the flags are digital.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,528
Well, now
the flags are digital,

49
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:50,396
and you play it on computers.

50
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:51,924
And there's no running around,

51
00:01:51,924 --> 00:01:53,792
and there's no fields
or anything.

52
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,231
It's all on the Internet.

53
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,857
Okay, so, it's not --
it's not exactly the same,

54
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:58,693
but it's still really simple.

55
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:02,000
So, what you have is,
you have a set of flags,

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,759
and these flags are
on a server somewhere

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,627
and associated with challenges.

58
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,857
A challenge
might be a web server

59
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:10,330
that someone wrote in "C,"
and it has vulnerabilities.

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,363
It might be a binary
that's been compiled,

61
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:14,099
and you have
to reverse-engineer it

62
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,560
and try to find a serial number,

63
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,000
who might be file
that's been encrypted,

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,495
and you have to decrypt it.

65
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:21,429
It might be a web application

66
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:24,132
that has SQL injection
or something like that.

67
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:26,759
So, your job --
Well, you go in,

68
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,197
you pick a challenge
that you want to work on,

69
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:30,924
and you try to recover the flag.

70
00:02:30,924 --> 00:02:34,495
So, maybe you find a buffer
overflow in this web server,

71
00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:36,396
and you exploit it,
and you get a flag back.

72
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:39,329
And this flag is worth
some points in this contest.

73
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,330
And the flag --
Well, maybe it's just a file

74
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,297
in the file system
or something like that,

75
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:46,528
and you read it, and you just
get this little string.

76
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:49,263
So, I'd signed up

77
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,363
for this competition
with my friends.

78
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:53,495
And we were really excited.
We read that the --

79
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:55,066
The top teams
from this competition

80
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,528
would actually be flown
to New York City,

81
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:58,495
and we were,
"That sounds pretty cool."

82
00:02:58,495 --> 00:03:00,792
So, came time to play,

83
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,396
and we all met on campus

84
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:05,165
in this small office
off in the corner.

85
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:07,297
And we were there 24 hours,

86
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:09,891
working on these competitions,
so all day and all night,

87
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,396
we were working
on these things.

88
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:15,857
So, we play this,
and we got first place.

89
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,231
We were super thrilled.

90
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,528
Now, I know you're saying,
"Well, Tyler,

91
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:20,066
that's because of
all those tutorials

92
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,528
you read in high school, right?"

93
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,099
Eh, maybe not so much.

94
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,363
I was definitely the worst
person on the team by far.

95
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,528
So, at this point, I was
a little bit scared, right?

96
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,231
I was going in saying,
"Well, crap.

97
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:32,957
We're going to this final round
in New York City,

98
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,329
and here I am, a total newb.

99
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,165
I don't want to embarrass
myself or my team,

100
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:37,957
so what am I gonna do?"

101
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:40,033
So, if you're familiar
with all great stories,

102
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:42,494
the next part
is the training montage.

103
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:46,594
So, I trained for the next month
or so, you know,

104
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,825
playing old capture-the-flag
contest challenges,

105
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:51,099
talking to people on my team

106
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,825
so I wouldn't make
a total fool of myself.

107
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:55,033
Now, this seems silly,

108
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,428
but this is actually
a really important part

109
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:58,231
of capture-the-flag contests.

110
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:00,429
So, they provide motivation.

111
00:04:00,429 --> 00:04:02,363
So, just like Rocky
wasn't motivated

112
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:04,033
to stop being a lazy bum

113
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,857
until he had a fight
with Apollo,

114
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:08,726
hackers can kind of get off
their butts and start working

115
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:11,066
when they're motivated
by a competition.

116
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,165
Now, you may be saying,
"Well, wait a minute.

117
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:14,891
I mean, it feels
like I'm already

118
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,065
doing computer security,
and it's already a competition."

119
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:19,131
We've got
United States versus China

120
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:22,660
or Tavis Ormandy
versus all of antivirus,

121
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,132
and this feels like
a competition going on, right?

122
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,429
Well, but it's not
the same, right?

123
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:28,099
These are never-ending battles,

124
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:30,527
and never-ending battles
don't have a winner and loser,

125
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,561
which means there's
no real incentive

126
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,164
for you to try
to go out and win,

127
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:37,033
so it's not the same level
of motivation.

128
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:39,594
Capture-the-flag contests also
have instant feedback.

129
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:41,264
When you capture a flag,

130
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:43,462
you know right away
that you've got something,

131
00:04:43,462 --> 00:04:45,132
and this is very different
from something

132
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:48,429
like maybe writing a report,

133
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:50,131
which you would do
in some other competitions

134
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,198
because you might write
something, and it's wrong,

135
00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:54,164
and you don't find out
for a week.

136
00:04:54,165 --> 00:04:55,825
In the capture-the-flag
contests,

137
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:58,759
you keep trying
until you get what you want.

138
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,033
And this also means that as soon
as you get what you want,

139
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,330
you get a little bit
of an adrenaline boost,

140
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,231
and this keeps you motivated.

141
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:06,066
There's also a ranking system.

142
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,462
When you're playing
in these events,

143
00:05:07,462 --> 00:05:09,066
you don't just know
what your own score is.

144
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,330
You see a list
of all the teams in order.

145
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,264
This means you know
who your worst enemy is.

146
00:05:14,264 --> 00:05:15,528
It's the person right above you.

147
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:16,561
So, you might say,

148
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:18,066
"Well, if I solve
this one more challenge,

149
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:21,066
I'll move up one little place,"
and that motivates

150
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:22,395
you to just push
a little bit ahead,

151
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:24,594
and you keep doing this
until you're on top.

152
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:26,693
But it's not just about teams.

153
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,099
It's also
about personal motivation.

154
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,462
So, all these challenges
have point values.

155
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:33,495
So, in my first competition,
I didn't do very well.

156
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:35,429
Maybe I got 200 points
or something,

157
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:36,792
but I could say to myself,
"Well, next time

158
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:39,462
I'm gonna go in,
and I'll get 300 points."

159
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,495
And so, in this way, you can set
these very reasonable goals

160
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:46,396
and make personal progress
that you can actually track.

161
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:49,132
So, been training for a month.

162
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:51,594
I went into this competition,
final round in New York with --

163
00:05:51,594 --> 00:05:52,957
with the rest of my team.

164
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:54,594
And we won.
We got first place.

165
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:56,891
Again, super exciting,
and you're probably saying,

166
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,462
"Well, you trained
for a month, right?

167
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,627
I mean, that's --
That's all it takes?"

168
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:04,924
No. Again, no, that's not
all it takes, sadly.

169
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:06,395
I was still not very good.

170
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:08,066
I'd improved, certainly.

171
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,758
But I still wasn't
where I wanted to be.

172
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,924
So, I kept playing.
I kept playing with this team,

173
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:15,066
and we kept playing
throughout the year.

174
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:18,758
So, we played
in several competitions.

175
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,132
We didn't win first place
in all of them,

176
00:06:20,132 --> 00:06:22,924
but we did very respectably,
and we were pretty proud.

177
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,330
So, at the end
of the school year in May,

178
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,032
it came time for DEF CON CTF.

179
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,627
So, a lot of you
are probably familiar

180
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:30,165
with DEF CON as the conference,

181
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,066
but it's not just a conference.

182
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,825
There's also a capture-the-flag
competition associated with it,

183
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:36,858
and this has actually
been running every year

184
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,363
for the past 20 years.

185
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:41,165
So, in some sense,
this is like the World Series

186
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,759
of these capture-the-flag
competitions,

187
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,132
so it's a really big deal to us.

188
00:06:45,132 --> 00:06:47,858
So, we'd been doing pretty well,
and we said, "Well,

189
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:50,033
the next step
is try to go in DEF CON."

190
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,825
So we signed up.

191
00:06:51,825 --> 00:06:54,825
We went on the online qualifier.

192
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:57,231
And we didn't make it.
We were the first alternates.

193
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,198
We were just --
just barely there,

194
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:01,066
but we didn't make it.

195
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:03,164
And now, we're
a competitive group of people,

196
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:06,099
so I know if you have
good foreshadowing abilities,

197
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,231
you'd say, "Well,
I know what comes next --

198
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,891
another training montage."

199
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:10,957
And that's exactly right.

200
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:12,462
So, what are we doing,
though, right?

201
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:13,825
I mean, we can't
the Rocky strategy

202
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:15,033
of punching frozen meat.

203
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,759
That doesn't really help
with computer security.

204
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,297
So, how do we practice?

205
00:07:18,297 --> 00:07:20,660
Well, our team practices

206
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,660
by participating
in these competitions.

207
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,759
Now, that sounds
a little circular and silly,

208
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,891
but it's actually
the best way to do it.

209
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:29,693
So, it's not just these couple
competitions that I mentioned.

210
00:07:29,693 --> 00:07:32,561
There are several of
these competitions every month,

211
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,263
and so you can use these
to keep boasting your skills.

212
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:36,759
Every time
you play one of these,

213
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,627
you learn a little bit more,
so the more you participate in,

214
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,099
the better you do.

215
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,264
So, you have to actually
actively

216
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:44,726
participate
in these competitions.

217
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:46,264
A lot of people
will come to me and say,

218
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:48,495
"Well, Tyler, you know,
I signed up for the competitions

219
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:50,759
and clicked around,
and I looked at the problems,

220
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,759
and I did this 10 times,
and I'm not any better."

221
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,066
Well, yeah,
that's not surprising.

222
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,198
You have to actually play
the whole competition,

223
00:07:57,198 --> 00:07:59,626
and that means
playing from start to end

224
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:01,726
and sometimes even
past the end.

225
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,891
A good example of this --
a couple years ago,

226
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:05,726
there was a Russian competition.

227
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,627
One of the challenges involved

228
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,924
a discrete logarithm
calculation.

229
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,957
We saw some program,
wrote something really quickly,

230
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:15,363
and it took about three hours
for it to run.

231
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:18,297
And at the end of the three
hours, it got the flag.

232
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,198
The issue is that
was about 10 minutes

233
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:23,263
after the competition ended,
so it didn't get us any points.

234
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:24,891
Now, it's easy at this point
to say,

235
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:26,066
"Well, eh, not a big deal."

236
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:27,363
I mean,
we got the flag,

237
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:29,792
we solved the problem,
wipe our hands clean of it,

238
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:31,395
and move on with our lives,

239
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,033
but that's not how you improve.

240
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:36,164
So, instead, I went back,
I looked at this problem,

241
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:37,693
and I found there was actually
some structure

242
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:38,924
that we hadn't really looked at

243
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,395
that allowed us
to parallelize it.

244
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,231
So, I wrote a solver on GPUs,
ended up solving the problem

245
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,495
that took three hours
in about 10 minutes.

246
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:47,594
This was a real solution that
would have got us the points,

247
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:50,033
and this is how I learned.

248
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,660
The other aspect
of these competitions is

249
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,924
you can read write-ups.

250
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:55,396
So, a lot of the teams
that solve these problems

251
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:58,495
will document how they --
how they got the flags.

252
00:08:58,495 --> 00:08:59,891
So, you can read through these

253
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:01,627
if you didn't solve a problem,
and you can say, "Oh,

254
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,165
that's -- that's
what I was missing.

255
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:05,033
That's how I was
supposed to do it."

256
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,594
Similarly, even if you do solve
a challenge,

257
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:10,066
it turns out there's lots
of cute tricks

258
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,693
and other methods
of solving these things

259
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,297
that not everyone
does the same way.

260
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:15,891
So you can read them,
and you can find out new ways

261
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:17,527
and new tricks
and things like that.

262
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,363
So, it's really nice.
You just go online.

263
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:22,594
You can Google CTF write-up,
tens of thousands of results,

264
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:24,033
and read through them.

265
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,891
And lastly,
although we try to play in

266
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,065
as many competitions
as we can, well,

267
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:30,000
you aren't gonna play
in every single one,

268
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,099
so you can still look at
the problems from the contests

269
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:34,000
you haven't played.

270
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,759
So, we'd been training.

271
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,099
And this paid off
really well.

272
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,462
We went back to New York.

273
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:41,198
That was great.
Got first place.

274
00:09:41,198 --> 00:09:42,627
That was no problem.
We already did that.

275
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:44,527
But then we went
to South Korea.

276
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:46,495
We went to South Korea
and played in a CTF there.

277
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,726
We got first place,

278
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:50,495
and we got $20,000,
which was pretty nice.

279
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:51,825
And then we went to Russia.

280
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,099
We went to Moscow and played
in a competition there.

281
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,594
Again, first place.

282
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:57,858
So, we were doing
pretty well.

283
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:00,296
Our team at this point
had really grown and matured.

284
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:01,957
And it's important to realize

285
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:03,726
that these CTF teams
are really teams.

286
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:05,825
It's not a collection
of individuals.

287
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:08,924
And so, this seems like kind
of mushy, feely type of stuff,

288
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:11,098
but it's actually -- There's
really practical reasons.

289
00:10:11,099 --> 00:10:12,759
The first is motivation.

290
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:15,759
I said these competitions
can easily be 24 hours,

291
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,066
and so, when you think about it,
sitting in front of a computer

292
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,693
for 24 hours isn't always easy.

293
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:21,396
You might start
checking Facebook

294
00:10:21,396 --> 00:10:23,726
or Twitter, or maybe
you want to go to sleep.

295
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:25,462
And that's understandable,
but if you have someone

296
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:26,759
next to you working,

297
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,231
it's a lot easier
to stay awake and stay motivated

298
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:31,957
and stay focused
on these problems.

299
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:35,099
Also, having a team
allows a diverse set of skills.

300
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,066
I mentioned
that not all the challenges

301
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,396
are solved in the same way,

302
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:40,329
so having different viewpoints
from different people

303
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,825
on your team can really
help give alternate perspectives

304
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,858
on these problems.

305
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:48,263
And in a very similar vein,
this allows for specialization.

306
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:50,858
So, for example, I'm
very interested in cryptography.

307
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,032
Someone else on my team

308
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:54,165
might be very interested
in Windows exploitation.

309
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:55,693
So I can let them deal

310
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:58,593
with understanding
the latest EMET bypass,

311
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:02,132
and, likewise, they don't have
to understand the intricacies

312
00:11:02,132 --> 00:11:04,957
of a sub-group confinement
attack for Diffie-Hellman.

313
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:06,792
And so we each got to focus
on the things

314
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,264
that we're really interested in,

315
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:12,363
and at the same time,
our team will improve greatly.

316
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:14,561
So, you might be saying,
"Well, so,

317
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:15,924
does this mean
if I want to pick a team,

318
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,660
I should have
them list their skills

319
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,593
and throw out the ones
that we already have?"

320
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,264
That's not --
That's not how we do it.

321
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,033
It turns that what we found is
that interest and dedication

322
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:27,066
are the most important traits.

323
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,363
And this seems
a little silly, but,

324
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:30,858
again, it's for
very practical reasons.

325
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,329
The technical skills
are already there

326
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,330
when we're picking players,

327
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,528
and so what we really
are looking for is people

328
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:39,000
that are gonna show up
and continue to show up

329
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,231
and have their skills
improve over time.

330
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:42,429
And so,
what we do is,

331
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:45,231
we invite everyone
to come join our team,

332
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:46,594
and the people
that aren't dedicated,

333
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:49,693
aren't interested, well,
they just stop showing up.

334
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,924
So it's
a very self-selecting process,

335
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:53,726
and this ends up with us getting
the most dedicated,

336
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,132
interested people,

337
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:58,824
and after a couple years,
they turn out to be the best.

338
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:02,627
So, we'd been doing this.
Our team had grown.

339
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:04,726
Now it was time
to qualify for DEF CON.

340
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:07,792
So, this year, things
were a little bit different.

341
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:10,165
They actually
allowed us to qualify

342
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,296
through winning certain
well-known contests.

343
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:14,033
So, one of them was ICTF.

344
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,363
We won that -- easy.

345
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:17,693
So we had already qualified.

346
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,528
But then we went
and we also won Codegate,

347
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:22,396
which is another CTF
that was a qualification.

348
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:23,924
And then just to put the nail
in the coffin,

349
00:12:23,924 --> 00:12:26,462
we went back, we played
DEF CON qualifier again,

350
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:28,363
and we did well enough
to qualify that way, too.

351
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:31,858
So we made sure that
we really qualified this time.

352
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:34,329
So, but we were getting ready
for DEF CON finals,

353
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,561
and it turns out these are --
DEF CON finals

354
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:39,033
are a lot different
from the DEF CON qualifier.

355
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,693
So, in CTF nomenclature,

356
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,957
there's kind
of two distinct versions of CTF.

357
00:12:42,957 --> 00:12:44,462
One is called Jeopardy.

358
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:46,297
The other's
called Attack-Defense.

359
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:47,825
Jeopardy is
the most common event,

360
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:51,198
and it's also usually associated
with online competitions,

361
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,231
which is the majority
of what we do.

362
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,726
In contrast, Attack-Defense
is more traditional.

363
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,957
You actually steal flags
from other teams

364
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:00,363
just like you do
in the playground event.

365
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,264
Attack-Defense is also in-person

366
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:04,033
or usually associated
with conferences

367
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,396
and things like DEF CON.

368
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:08,329
So, in Jeopardy,
the organizers

369
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,627
host all of the challenges.

370
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,429
So they create these challenges,

371
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,726
and they run themselves
on their own servers,

372
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,363
whereas Attack-Defense,
the teams host the challenges.

373
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,000
So, the organizers write them,

374
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,594
but as a team,
it's your responsibility

375
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:21,330
to make sure
the challenge is running

376
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,429
and make sure
that no one's hacking into it.

377
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:26,098
So, it's a lot of different
categories in Jeopardy.

378
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:27,528
In Attack-Defense,
it's basically

379
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:30,231
just binary exploitation.

380
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:32,924
And the names of these --
well, Jeopardy,

381
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:35,429
a lot of times the scoreboard
or when you pick challenges,

382
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:37,033
it looks a lot
like a Jeopardy board.

383
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,957
You just pick a category
that you're interested in,

384
00:13:38,957 --> 00:13:41,561
and then you pick a point value
just like Jeopardy.

385
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:42,825
Attack-Defense --

386
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,759
well, things are a little bit
more complicated.

387
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,858
So, you don't just pick that.

388
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:49,098
You have to pick teams,
and then you have to decide

389
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,099
which teams to attack
and when and so forth,

390
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:53,495
so it's a little bit different.

391
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:56,363
So, it's time for DEF CON
finals.

392
00:13:56,363 --> 00:13:59,000
We had qualified,
and we went in.

393
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,561
And, well, we did okay,
not great.

394
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,231
After a year
of winning competitions,

395
00:14:04,231 --> 00:14:06,759
getting seventh place
out of 12 teams

396
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:07,792
didn't feel so great.

397
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:09,033
We weren't super thrilled,

398
00:14:09,033 --> 00:14:10,528
but we at least
made it to DEF CON,

399
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:12,396
and that was nice.

400
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:13,660
Now, at this point,
our team

401
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,033
was about two years old.

402
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:16,528
So, what's kind of happening?

403
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:18,495
Well, the original founder
of the team,

404
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:22,693
Brian Pak, graduated,
which meant I was in charge.

405
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,264
I was no longer the worst person
on the team.

406
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,792
I was actually pretty good
at this point, which was nice,

407
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:29,726
and so I took over the team.

408
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:31,627
And the next several years,

409
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:34,132
we continued to grow
and improve.

410
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:35,462
So, the next few years,

411
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,033
we not only went back to Russia

412
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,825
and South Korea
for these contests.

413
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:41,528
We went to Japan
and Taiwan, as well.

414
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:43,726
And we actually had
to incorporate our team.

415
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:46,066
We formed The Plaid Parliament
of Pwning Incorporated 'cause

416
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,957
we were winning so much money
from these contests

417
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:50,462
that we couldn't handle it
any other way.

418
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:53,165
So, we were pretty happy.

419
00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:54,627
I know you're saying,
"Well, fine,

420
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,132
but what about the World Series

421
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:57,891
that you talked about,
DEF CON CTF?"

422
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:58,891
So, the next year,

423
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:01,693
we went back, qualified,
no problem.

424
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:05,528
This was a graph
of the scores over time

425
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:08,792
about an hour
before the competition ended.

426
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,660
And this was it
when the competition did end.

427
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,396
So, if you notice,
there's another team

428
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,296
that sniped us
at the last minute.

429
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:18,330
So, second place.
It's okay.

430
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,891
You know,

431
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:21,957
second place is pretty good,
I guess,

432
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:23,198
but we weren't super thrilled,

433
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:24,759
so we went back.

434
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,924
Next year, first place --
much better.

435
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:28,429
Not just by a small margin.

436
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,396
Actually,
by a large, large gap.

437
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:34,858
Next year, we went back,
and we did the same thing.

438
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:37,858
So, today, well,

439
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,824
I guess I've actually
become a hacker.

440
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:42,495
But a reasonable question
to ask is,

441
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,132
"I see you've been
playing these games

442
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:46,263
for the past 6 1/2 years.

443
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:48,066
Does that mean anything
about real security,

444
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:51,297
or are you just playing
these stupid little games?"

445
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,330
So, obviously, I think I did
learn a lot about real security.

446
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,165
In my view, CTF problems

447
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:59,264
are almost like
distilled real-world problems.

448
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:00,495
So, this means two things.

449
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:02,462
The first is
that they're more concentrated

450
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,098
in the sense
that for the amount

451
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:07,825
of time you put into them,
you get a lot more out of them.

452
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:10,231
But they also are made
of the same stuff.

453
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:13,099
When you do a CTF problem,
you're using the same skills.

454
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,891
You're thinking
about the same problems

455
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,198
that you think about
when you're solving

456
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:19,329
real-world security challenges.

457
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,429
Now, I know you're gonna say,
"Well, fine, you can say that,

458
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:22,891
but I don't believe you."

459
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:25,396
Understandable, so let's go
over a few examples.

460
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:26,527
So, first one --

461
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,891
this was actually
just a couple weeks ago.

462
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:30,462
There was a news report
about a vulnerability,

463
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:33,429
an FFmpeg that let
people read remote files.

464
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:35,033
Someone
on our team saw this,

465
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,132
and they said, "Wait a second."

466
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:39,758
I did two months ago in
a capture-the-flag competition.

467
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,660
Before this vulnerability
was reported,

468
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,429
they actually had
to independently discover it

469
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:44,957
over the course
of this competition.

470
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:47,231
Fine.
Not exceptional, though.

471
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:50,462
The year before that, there was
a competition called Codegate.

472
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:53,330
One of the intended solutions
for solving a challenge

473
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,429
was to actually use
a zero-day and bzip

474
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,000
to get memory corruption.

475
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,429
Okay, the year
before that,

476
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,792
preparing for DEF CON,

477
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:04,231
what a lot of teams
will actually do

478
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,231
is find zero-days
and utilities like Wireshark

479
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:08,693
that a lot of teams use.

480
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,693
So, they're finding
these and mentioning

481
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:13,198
that they found
these to attack other teams.

482
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,396
Year before that,
I actually wrote a challenge

483
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:18,659
that used an undocumented bug

484
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,924
in the Go compiler

485
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:23,494
that allowed for running
untyped safe code

486
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:26,329
in what's supposed
to be a fairly safe language.

487
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:28,462
Year before that,
there was a web problem.

488
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:31,693
The intended solution
was XPath injection,

489
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:34,198
and the Dutch team
that solved it

490
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:36,561
or one of the Dutch --
one of the teams that solved it,

491
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:39,792
they actually found
a remote code execution bug

492
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,528
in the PFP module

493
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,825
that affected millions of users
and websites like Yahoo.

494
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:48,066
The year before that,
at DEF CON, there was a team

495
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,528
that found
a local privilege escalation bug

496
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,627
in FreeBSD.

497
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:57,033
So, yes, there's probably
some real-world relationships

498
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,593
between CTF problems
and security challenges

499
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:01,792
that we actually do.

500
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:04,627
But if that's the case, then
why are we doing games, right?

501
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:06,659
If I could've been doing
real-world work

502
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,792
for the past six years,
why wasn't I making any money

503
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:10,824
and playing these games instead?

504
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,396
Well, it was a couple reasons.

505
00:18:12,396 --> 00:18:14,132
So, the first is,
CTF problems

506
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:15,495
have graduated difficulty.

507
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,264
You wouldn't go up
to a teenager who said,

508
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,000
"I want to learn to be a hacker"

509
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,396
and tell them, "Well,
here's a copy of IDA.

510
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:23,099
Go download Chrome
and have some fun

511
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:24,165
and find some 0-days."

512
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,825
They're not gonna get anywhere.

513
00:18:25,825 --> 00:18:29,000
And similarly, these problems
don't just start off easy.

514
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,627
They actually get very hard.

515
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:32,792
A lot
of the more difficult problems

516
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:34,462
are a lot more complicated

517
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:36,000
and use some things

518
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,363
that most people would never see
in their day-to-day work.

519
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:41,297
It's also, playing
in these competitions

520
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:43,231
is a relatively easy commitment.

521
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:46,033
I mean, you do have to dedicate
24 or 48 hours,

522
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:47,824
but it's a lot easier
than telling someone,

523
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:50,792
"Well, go quit your job and get
a new job in computer security

524
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,330
if that's what you want
to be doing."

525
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,033
That's not so easy.

526
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,561
There's also
no barrier of entry.

527
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,627
You don't have to pay anything
to join these competitions.

528
00:18:57,627 --> 00:19:00,066
You just sign up online,
and you can start playing.

529
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,330
No one makes you take a test
or pass an entrance exam.

530
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,297
Again, if you wanted
to do computer security

531
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:07,231
for a living,
it's not the same thing.

532
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:10,066
You can't just walk in and say,
"I want to do security"

533
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,462
and someone will give you
some interesting work.

534
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:15,165
And lastly,
as we talked about,

535
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:17,297
CTFs help motivate people.

536
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:19,924
So, kind of in short, CTFs work.

537
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,825
They don't just teach you
the technical skills.

538
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:25,264
They also teach you
the creative problem solving

539
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,924
that only comes from
doing practical, hands-on work.

540
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:31,066
And so, for training
and computer security,

541
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:34,330
I really don't think there's
anything that can be CTFs.

542
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,362
So, if you're like me,
you're saying,

543
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:39,495
"Damn, I wish I knew about this
when I was a teenager."

544
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:40,726
Yeah, well,
I thought that,

545
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:42,264
and our team thought that, too.

546
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,627
There's not much we can do,
but maybe there's something.

547
00:19:44,627 --> 00:19:47,264
So, in 2013, our team

548
00:19:47,264 --> 00:19:51,131
actually created a competition
specifically for high schoolers

549
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:53,396
to introduce them to security.

550
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:55,000
So, this competition
was fairly successful.

551
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,792
We got over 10,000 U.S.
high school students to play.

552
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:01,495
We got several schools
and teachers involved, as well,

553
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:03,593
and it's actually
a huge success.

554
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:04,792
So, you might be thinking,

555
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,231
"Well, I'm not
a teenager anymore.

556
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:08,759
This doesn't affect me."
Well, that's not true.

557
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,627
It's not too late
for you to do this.

558
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,726
It's not just high schoolers

559
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,660
or college students
that play in these competitions.

560
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,924
It's professors
and industry professionals

561
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:21,956
that play in these things, too,
and continue to learn things.

562
00:20:21,957 --> 00:20:24,000
So, if you've never
played in a CTF,

563
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,033
I encourage you to go out
and do it.

564
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:29,792
And I think your teenage self
will thank you.

565
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:31,231
And that's it.

566
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,429
Are there any questions?

567
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:35,792
[ Applause ]

568
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:34,792
