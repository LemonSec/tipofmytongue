1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:05,297


2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,660
-Thank you, everyone, for coming.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,000
I want to introduce everyone today

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,231
to a new type of attack that we've been seeing.

5
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:13,396
It's something we're calling a data-integrity-based attack,

6
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:14,693
which we've witnessed

7
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:17,131
specifically in the context of investigative domains,

8
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:20,066
but we believe is happening much more broadly.

9
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:22,264
What this is, is it's a way that companies

10
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:25,957
or individuals are exploiting our new reliance on data science

11
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:27,297
and automated reasoning

12
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:30,165
to change the outcomes of those processes

13
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:34,495
to favor decisions that they would prefer.

14
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:36,065
Before I get into the specifics of the talk,

15
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,858
I want to thank a lot of the partners we have with us.

16
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:39,297
We've had a two-year relationship

17
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:42,099
with the World Bank Group, which provided the bulk of the data

18
00:00:42,099 --> 00:00:43,956
that we can actually talk about today.

19
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:46,000
They've been fantastic partners,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,363
and this partnership has been made possible

21
00:00:48,363 --> 00:00:50,726
through the University of Chicago's

22
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:52,891
Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship,

23
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:54,330
where I've served twice as a mentor.

24
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,726
It's a fantastic program.

25
00:00:55,726 --> 00:00:56,792
They're still taking applications,

26
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:59,198
for any students in the room.

27
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:00,858
And it's also been made possible

28
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:03,660
by something that I think everyone's familiar with here,

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,000
which is this new data deluge.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,726
It's the fact that we're collecting more

31
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,297
and more information about our environment

32
00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:13,627
and trying to use this to reason about the different sectors

33
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:15,164
that we might be doing business in,

34
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:17,726
the individuals we might be doing business with

35
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:21,264
to build a better picture of our world.

36
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:23,890
Now, of this data we're collecting, estimates are

37
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:27,000
that only about 23% of it is actually useful

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,297
if we are able to tag and analyze it.

39
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,000
But a bigger hurdle we've been running into

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,660
is our ability to utilize

41
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,164
this theoretically useful information.

42
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:38,198
And we're only getting about 1% right now.

43
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,693
This means there's a lot of information

44
00:01:39,693 --> 00:01:42,396
we could be using to make better decisions,

45
00:01:42,396 --> 00:01:45,594
and it's driving us towards the rise

46
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:48,726
of automated reasoning and machine learning.

47
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:51,726
More and more, more of our processes are being automated.

48
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:54,396
The decisions are being made, at least in part,

49
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:56,066
using these algorithms,

50
00:01:56,066 --> 00:01:58,330
and it's exposing us to a vulnerability

51
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,164
that we haven't had in the past, or that, if we did have,

52
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:02,528
was less severe.

53
00:02:02,528 --> 00:02:03,627
And that's the vulnerability

54
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:05,660
that people could exploit this process

55
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,098
and exploit what they know about our automated reasoning

56
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,066
to direct our decisions towards things that they would like.

57
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:16,132
The primary context I'm gonna talk about these attacks through

58
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:20,033
are international procurement with the World Bank Group.

59
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,428
If you know anything about the World Bank,

60
00:02:21,429 --> 00:02:22,627
what they primarily do

61
00:02:22,627 --> 00:02:25,363
is they exist to lend money and expertise

62
00:02:25,363 --> 00:02:28,792
to countries seeking to improve their infrastructure.

63
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:31,066
This could be a country wanting to build a road.

64
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,033
They could be looking to build schools.

65
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,000
They could be looking to build public-health facilities,

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,825
or to provide training and experience to individuals

67
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,726
who will staff these schools or public-health facilities

68
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:43,660
or other government organizations.

69
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,033
The World Bank provides both money

70
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:47,165
and guidance in the contracting process

71
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:48,396
to try to ensure

72
00:02:48,396 --> 00:02:50,000
that the countries end up with something

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,561
that improves their infrastructure

74
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:55,396
so that we can raise the standard of living globally.

75
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:57,528
The typical way that this process happens

76
00:02:57,528 --> 00:02:59,495
is the World Bank works with some country

77
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:03,198
that has an infrastructure project in mind.

78
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:05,561
They lend funds for that specific project

79
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,825
to the country.

80
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:08,528
But then, the country itself isn't the one

81
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:11,792
that implements those infrastructure improvements.

82
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,957
Instead, they work to buy goods and services

83
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:16,759
from various contracting entities.

84
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,396
These could be individuals, or they could be companies.

85
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:22,263
And hopefully they provide then the infrastructure

86
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:25,759
that the money is being lended for.

87
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,329
The goal with this is that the suppliers

88
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,099
would be chosen through some competitive bidding process,

89
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,066
and this competitive bidding process should ensure

90
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:35,264
that the suppliers are both able to provide the services

91
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:38,792
and that they are shepherded through the entire process

92
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:40,726
and actually render the services.

93
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:43,165
But the reality is, is that the suppliers

94
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:44,792
influence this process,

95
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,726
they damage the competitive nature,

96
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,495
and they commit collusion, corruption, and fraud.

97
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,000
And this results in an enormous amount of waste.

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,363
We don't know exactly the amount,

99
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:55,924
but the current estimates are

100
00:03:55,924 --> 00:03:58,429
that we're only catching about 4%

101
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:00,825
of the actual cases of collusion, corruption,

102
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:04,131
and fraud.

103
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:06,429
The way this manifests is when the World Bank lends money

104
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:09,495
and intends to build some road that might exist for many years,

105
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,264
helping to improve infrastructure and the lives

106
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:13,462
of the individuals in the company,

107
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,132
sometimes they end up with a substandard road

108
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:20,660
that doesn't meet the expectations that they had.

109
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,099
And other times, they end up with no road whatsoever.

110
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,627
This is one of the more interesting cases, I think,

111
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:27,462
for us to target, because it's a case

112
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:29,033
where the funds are taken

113
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,726
and used for other purposes entirely.

114
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:33,033
Maybe they're being used for bribes.

115
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,792
Maybe they're being used to buy certain items

116
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,395
that have nothing to do with the project.

117
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,726
Or maybe they're just being pocketed

118
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:41,000
by a company that disappears overnight.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,264
And it's a little surprising that this can happen.

120
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:45,132
But what happens is, the company will come forward

121
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,759
and say, "We're a huge company.

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,429
We have 30,000 engineers.

123
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:51,263
We've done these sorts of projects before."

124
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,165
They provide data that backs up these claims,

125
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:55,792
they provide references,

126
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,066
and then they don't do the project

127
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,825
or they do it insufficiently.

128
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,330
And oftentimes, when we go

129
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,198
and we look to find these companies later,

130
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:04,231
we don't find a large headquarters

131
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:05,759
in some industrial park.

132
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,561
We find a mail slot

133
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:09,000
through which they can accept billing,

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,099
through which they can accept payment,

135
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,726
but there's no one actually home anymore.

136
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,594
They've packed up and moved.

137
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:17,198
What's really surprising to me is that this isn't just

138
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:19,363
happening in faraway parts of the world

139
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:21,726
where transparency isn't great.

140
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:25,363
In at least one example, this happened in Chicago.

141
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:27,924
These are companies operating from the United States,

142
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:30,263
representing themselves as experts,

143
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:31,759
and getting away with fraud, collusion,

144
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,264
and corruption by damaging this data process.

145
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:38,792
And I think that's something that makes these attacks unique.

146
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:39,957
We're not talking about

147
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,693
traditional cybersecurity attacks,

148
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:44,527
where we're worried about someone escalating privileges

149
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:46,924
within our systems, making these decisions.

150
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:49,132
We're not really worried about malicious software

151
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:51,858
or potential hardware attacks.

152
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,099
We are worried about these things,

153
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:55,066
but it's not the vector that we're seeing.

154
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:58,626
Instead, what we're seeing is a different vector.

155
00:05:58,627 --> 00:06:02,099
We're seeing a subversion of the automated reasoning itself --

156
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,659
or the machine learning and decision processes --

157
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,759
due to malicious manipulation and falsification

158
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,231
of data collected through normal channels.

159
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,825
The anatomy of attack on data integrity

160
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:17,594
looks almost the same as the anatomy

161
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,759
of our normal data-collection process.

162
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,033
We have some automated reasoning.

163
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:25,429
We have people providing data for us to make decisions.

164
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:26,890
We inspect that data

165
00:06:26,891 --> 00:06:28,792
and hopefully come to some conclusion

166
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:31,429
that enhances our objectives.

167
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:34,527
But in the case that the data that we receive is falsified

168
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,000
or otherwise manipulated,

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,528
it compromises the integrity of this process

170
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:43,891
and instead leads to decisions that favor the attackers.

171
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,066
There's a lot of different goals that we've seen in the data

172
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:49,626
that we've examined so far for data-integrity attacks.

173
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:52,264
One of the most common is identity obfuscation.

174
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:53,693
This is when there's an individual

175
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:56,858
that may have been sanctioned or otherwise has some reason

176
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:58,462
to hide their identity.

177
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:00,264
They find ways to split their records

178
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:02,858
and create a second identity under which they can do business

179
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:07,627
within the actual automated-reasoning process.

180
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,231
We also see ability misrepresentation.

181
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:13,000
When it's well known what algorithms are being used

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,231
or there's some understanding by the attackers

183
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:17,594
of how they're going to be chosen,

184
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:19,066
they can try to design their data

185
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,758
so that they look like that magical needle in the haystack

186
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,891
that will lead them to be selected by this process.

187
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:29,165
We also see environment misrepresentation.

188
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,033
This happens when you have perhaps a normal,

189
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,660
healthy market with only a few bad players

190
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,099
who then collude or set up front companies

191
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:38,825
to submit a lot of invalid data

192
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,231
or data which misrepresents the environment

193
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:43,165
and causes us to make bad decisions

194
00:07:43,165 --> 00:07:45,132
because we no longer understand the environment

195
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,396
in which we're operating.

196
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:49,825
The strategies that we've witnessed

197
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:51,957
by which companies try to do these attacks

198
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:54,528
we kind of group into three main areas.

199
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:56,165
The first is data pollution.

200
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:57,528
It's when they flood our databases

201
00:07:57,528 --> 00:08:00,066
with large amounts of data, falsified or otherwise,

202
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,957
that change our view of the environment.

203
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:05,132
We see a lot of cases of data falsification,

204
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:08,792
where there's misrepresentations of a company's actual identity

205
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,825
or misrepresentation of the way that that company operates,

206
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,231
the expertise it has, and reasons to believe them.

207
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,659
And the last and most interesting to me

208
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,792
is what we're calling data blending.

209
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:21,164
It's when potentially legitimate data

210
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,726
is submitted in such a way

211
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:25,000
that it bypasses automated checks

212
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,264
and tries to pass by any types of defenses

213
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:29,792
that we might have in place

214
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,264
to keep these companies out of the marketplace.

215
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,726
I've given you an example

216
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:38,000
of an identity-obfuscation attack within the World Bank.

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,033
Let's talk a little bit about

218
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:41,825
how the procurement process works.

219
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:44,561
Typically, the World Bank will work with a country

220
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:47,132
to issue a call for suppliers.

221
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,560
The suppliers will then submit data on their bids.

222
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:52,330
This will include cost information, expertise,

223
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,594
previous work history,

224
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:57,726
and also exactly what they intend to provide.

225
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:59,462
One of them is selected through both automated

226
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:01,891
and human reasoning,

227
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:04,527
and a contract is then awarded.

228
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:06,594
At some point in the future, however,

229
00:09:06,594 --> 00:09:08,693
many of these companies will fall under investigation

230
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,792
by the World Bank's Vice Presidency of Integrity,

231
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:15,462
who can then void the contract, impose sanctions,

232
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:18,462
and even sometimes debar the companies, preventing them

233
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:21,660
from ever interacting in the marketplace again

234
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,363
or at least bar them from working in it for some time.

235
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:28,099
The identity-obfuscation attack is one in which the company

236
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,924
tries to then create an alternate identity

237
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:32,165
within the procurement system,

238
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:34,957
under which it can now continue to bid despite its sanctioned

239
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,825
or debarred status.

240
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:38,198
The debarment is a big deal, too,

241
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:40,429
because it's not just the World Bank that debars them.

242
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,957
When a company is debarred by an international development bank,

243
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,726
it's typically debarred at a global level.

244
00:09:46,726 --> 00:09:49,165
So, how do you do these identity obfuscation?

245
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,858
Sadly, in the past, it's been very easy.

246
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:53,627
If you have a company, like Acme Incorporated,

247
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,758
of the easiest ways that we've seen

248
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,891
that they can create a separate identity

249
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:00,329
which allows them to go through the procurement process

250
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,957
would just be to shorten their existing name.

251
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:05,825
Surprisingly, this has worked in the past.

252
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:08,198
And if this isn't enough, I can do something else.

253
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:09,891
I can just misspell my name.

254
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:11,396
That creates an entirely different record

255
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:14,660
that's hard to resolve with my previous history

256
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,065
because there's just so much data

257
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:19,165
that we're dealing with.

258
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,824
The best thing, too, is some of these attacks --

259
00:10:20,825 --> 00:10:22,627
it doesn't even look like an attack.

260
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:25,957
How do I tell that this is malicious and not just a typo?

261
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:28,462
Now, we can see some companies that have history of this,

262
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,165
but it is difficult to determine malice

263
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,693
in all of these cases.

264
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:33,957
I'm gonna show you some real examples

265
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,495
with PricewaterhouseCoopers.

266
00:10:35,495 --> 00:10:37,330
I don't want to imply that they're in any way malicious.

267
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,363
I've actually picked them

268
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,396
'cause we're pretty sure that they're not.

269
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,891
But because they do a lot of great work

270
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,462
with the bank, we have a lot of records

271
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:44,627
that we were able to look at

272
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,198
and see how well the bank was resolving those.

273
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,726
And we found no less than 50 different identities

274
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:52,297
for PricewaterhouseCoopers that had been created

275
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:54,660
through what we think are non-malicious actions,

276
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,759
just people typing in the name wrong,

277
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,132
getting spellings incorrectly,

278
00:10:58,132 --> 00:10:59,693
having differences in abbreviation

279
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:02,660
and differences in white space.

280
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,528
Now, we do have some mechanisms that we can use

281
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:06,825
to attack these problems.

282
00:11:06,825 --> 00:11:10,033
OpenRefine is a great tool for these syntactic differences.

283
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,759
When we have structural similarity

284
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,198
between these identities,

285
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:16,165
we can attempt to rectify this and de-duplicate information

286
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:18,165
within our databases.

287
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,296
But it doesn't always work.

288
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,528
What if we just have PWC?

289
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:24,726
Is this PricewaterhouseCoopers?

290
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,000
Is it the Pacific Warehousing Company?

291
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Is it Porter Walls Company?

292
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,330
How do we distinguish between companies

293
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,363
and their subnational entities?

294
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,363
Should sanctions against a subnational entity

295
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,759
apply to the national entity?

296
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,198
Should sanctions against the national entity

297
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:42,561
apply to the subnational?

298
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:44,264
This is actually something we can't even get agreement

299
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:45,561
from between the World Bank.

300
00:11:45,561 --> 00:11:47,594
The Vice Presidency of Integrity says one thing.

301
00:11:47,594 --> 00:11:49,297
Procurement tells us something different.

302
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:51,363
So we're working on contact-sensitive resolution

303
00:11:51,363 --> 00:11:52,495
in those cases.

304
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:55,000
But it highlights a much bigger problem

305
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,495
with these sorts of tools that exist today.

306
00:11:57,495 --> 00:12:01,033
They were designed with this assumption

307
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:05,825
that the environments we were dealing in were non-malicious.

308
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,924
And this assumption is no longer true.

309
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:11,528
So the tools are ineffective

310
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,693
against some of the more sophisticated attacks,

311
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:16,231
even if they protect us from some of these smaller

312
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:19,165
or non-malicious examples.

313
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:20,824
Other vectors which we don't do so well against

314
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,660
with tools like OpenRefine or syntactic resolution --

315
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,363
re-incorporation and legal identity shifts.

316
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,000
We found that companies will oftentimes,

317
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,627
after being sanctioned or debarred,

318
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,957
change the name that they're operating in.

319
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:35,000
This information isn't always available to us

320
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,297
through primary sources

321
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,594
because of differences in transparency laws

322
00:12:38,594 --> 00:12:41,429
in different countries.

323
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,198
We also have cases where a company

324
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:47,198
might create a parent company which takes ownership of them.

325
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,429
Sometimes this is legitimate.

326
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,924
Sometimes it's a way to obfuscate our identity.

327
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:56,165
And beyond identity obfuscation and ability misrepresentation,

328
00:12:56,165 --> 00:13:00,296
there's the misrepresentation of the environment itself.

329
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,693
We've seen several marketplaces

330
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:04,165
that, at first glance, appear healthy.

331
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:05,528
There's three suppliers.

332
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:08,561
They all win roughly even numbers of times.

333
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:11,759
But on closer inspection, we see evidence of turn-taking,

334
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,792
where we have collusion between suppliers

335
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,660
to make the marketplace look healthy, when,

336
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,924
in fact, they're making sure that the contracts

337
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:19,495
are split evenly amongst them

338
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:22,363
and they're not delivering on the work.

339
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:23,792
In other cases, we may look at the bidding

340
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,099
on a single contract

341
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:27,462
and say, "Well, the winning bid was somewhat high,

342
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:29,462
but it was a very competitive marketplace."

343
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:31,825
But on further inspection, we find that the losing bids

344
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:33,561
were a little outrageous,

345
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:34,759
making it look like the winning bid

346
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,561
wasn't quite so as expensive as it was.

347
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:39,066
And there's a number of lower bids

348
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:42,132
that were all rejected for procedural reasons --

349
00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:44,693
they didn't submit a form,

350
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:47,726
they forgot to fill in some important information,

351
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,165
they neglected to give us information

352
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:50,264
on their billing accounts,

353
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:54,066
and they were rejected without review.

354
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,429
We oftentimes see patterns over time of certain suppliers

355
00:13:57,429 --> 00:13:59,858
in a marketplace that have all of their bids rejected,

356
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,231
and this is really surprising

357
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:04,066
because having a bid rejected is an expensive process.

358
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:06,231
It costs money to participate.

359
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:09,462
So, why would I be participating over a period of 10 years

360
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:13,495
in a marketplace in which I've never even had a bid reviewed?

361
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,165
This doesn't make sense financially

362
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:16,495
unless I'm a front company

363
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:18,924
that's helping to damage the view that I have

364
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,132
of the underlying environment.

365
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:23,593
Similarly, if we see a company that's never been successful

366
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:25,693
in a marketplace, that keeps submitting losing bids

367
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:27,429
and these bids are just so terrible

368
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:28,726
that they can't possibly win,

369
00:14:28,726 --> 00:14:30,231
we again question whether they're doing this,

370
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:31,891
if it's a repeated pattern.

371
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:38,726
And what this is leading us to is a new perspective

372
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,396
on how we handle data science

373
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:42,924
and machine learning in these environments.

374
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,824
We're now dealing with an adversarial space.

375
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:47,132
We need to find ways

376
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:51,296
that I would argue not only protect our processes,

377
00:14:51,297 --> 00:14:54,198
but are proactive in data offense

378
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:56,264
so that we're attacking some of these problems

379
00:14:56,264 --> 00:15:00,891
before they actually become an issue.

380
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:03,264
What I want to do is I want to build a community

381
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:05,660
that helps us build intelligent systems

382
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,759
so that we can fight data with data,

383
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,627
because just as the adversaries have strategies

384
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:13,957
that they're using to penetrate our systems

385
00:15:13,957 --> 00:15:16,858
and take control of our machine learning,

386
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:19,296
we have some strategies we can use, too.

387
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:22,231
And we have the advantage of data superiority.

388
00:15:22,231 --> 00:15:25,891
We have access to data that our attackers do not.

389
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,165
We have the ability to examine all of the data

390
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:31,759
that is being submitted to us, proprietary or otherwise,

391
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,165
and we can use a lot of algorithms

392
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,329
that have been developed

393
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,594
for both syntactic and semantic resolution

394
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:41,594
to improve our ability to understand these systems.

395
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:45,264
We can use the existing syntactic-resolution tools --

396
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:48,264
like OpenRefine, Levenshtein distance,

397
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:49,561
Ingram analysis --

398
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:52,627
to map some of these companies together initially.

399
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:56,098
And even in the cases where structural similarities fail us,

400
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:57,957
there are ways to get at these links

401
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,396
that indicate that the identities mean the same thing

402
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:05,231
even when they are represented completely differently.

403
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,825
One of our best ways of resolving

404
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:09,198
these semantic features is to phone a friend.

405
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:10,495
We can actually just ask Google.

406
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,726
If I ask Google

407
00:16:11,726 --> 00:16:13,858
about International Business Machines and IBM,

408
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:15,924
even though there's very little structural similarity,

409
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:17,462
Google knows these mean the same thing.

410
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:21,098
There's a crowdsource database out there for us to mine.

411
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,132
We can go and look at the pages that are returned,

412
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:26,593
look at similarities there, and start to build networks.

413
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:27,957
We've also been working with our allies

414
00:16:27,957 --> 00:16:29,495
who are building their own databases,

415
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:31,660
like Chris Taggart in London's OpenCorporates,

416
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,824
where he's been mapping

417
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,462
directors and investors between companies.

418
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:37,330
And he's actually been working with us directly

419
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,825
to even penetrate some of these markets

420
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:41,759
that aren't as open about this information

421
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,099
as we would like.

422
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:46,198
Furthermore, we can mine other expert data systems

423
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:47,396
for these connections.

424
00:16:47,396 --> 00:16:48,924
I'm not sure how many people are aware,

425
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,000
but Southwest, ValuJet, and AirTran --

426
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,858
all actually the same company.

427
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,527
I actually didn't know that before we were looking

428
00:16:54,528 --> 00:16:57,000
for some examples we could talk about with this.

429
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,924
But Wikipedia knew.

430
00:16:58,924 --> 00:17:00,726
There's a high amount of this information

431
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:02,462
in context-sensitive databases.

432
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:04,791
And even if we don't always trust these databases,

433
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,593
we have dates and information here

434
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:09,297
that we can corroborate with archival searches

435
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:10,660
on Google News.

436
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,132
And so we can try to pull these articles

437
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:14,594
that tell us things, like when a company was re-incorporated,

438
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:18,330
to build these connections.

439
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,824
It's not always available.

440
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:21,000
There are some countries

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,528
where we don't have this information,

442
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,528
and so we also learn from the experts.

443
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,132
We've been leveraging expert knowledge

444
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,363
of the development banks by asking them to help us

445
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,429
label data sets to try to identify past cases

446
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,330
and look through their investigative caseload

447
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,131
to identify when this has happened in the past.

448
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:39,693
Finally, we can leverage our data superiority.

449
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,825
We have the best picture of these markets

450
00:17:41,825 --> 00:17:43,693
because we can see what work has been done,

451
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,627
what bids were submitted, and who was working.

452
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:49,462
And the development banks all work together on a global level.

453
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:51,330
We can look for marketplaces where there was a high amount

454
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,792
of contracts awarded to a handful of players.

455
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,330
We can examine networks of companies

456
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,099
that seem to work together on the same contract.

457
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,593
And, in fact, the most predictive feature,

458
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:04,099
we've found, of collusion, corruption, and fraud

459
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:07,593
is the density of other people who have been investigated

460
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:10,660
or sanctioned within your network.

461
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,858
We can also look at past histories

462
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,561
of individual companies,

463
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,528
looking at whether or not they've had risky behavior

464
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,000
in the past.

465
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,825
Sometimes we find that they're largely

466
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:20,231
participating well in the marketplace

467
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,000
with one outlier in this new area

468
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,231
that their subsidiary moved into,

469
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,429
or cases where we have people

470
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,825
with a history of this kind of bad behavior.

471
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:33,132
Leveraging this data superiority gives us a better picture

472
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:34,660
of the network in general

473
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,528
and helps us to understand how they interrelate,

474
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:39,561
and these network features have been very predictive.

475
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:41,297
But it's not just about international finance

476
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:42,462
and development.

477
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:43,528
I don't have time today to talk about some

478
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:44,891
of the other cases we've looked at,

479
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:46,462
but we have worked with the EPA,

480
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,693
looking at cases where the Toxic Release Act

481
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,726
self-reporting guidelines were violated,

482
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:51,858
and there's some evidence

483
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:54,396
that companies were misreporting their data.

484
00:18:54,396 --> 00:18:57,197
And with the city of Cincinnati, we've been looking at cases

485
00:18:57,198 --> 00:19:00,066
where slumlords incorporate under multiple names

486
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,165
to try to stretch out legal processes

487
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,627
when they're violating tenant rights in the city.

488
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:06,858
All this leads us to say

489
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,363
that our approach to data has to change

490
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:12,099
and it has to become adversarial.

491
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,362
We need to be designing systems

492
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:19,033
which are made for this sort of adversarial environment.

493
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,858
This means a change in our approach

494
00:19:20,858 --> 00:19:22,924
so that security and integrity defenses

495
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:25,528
become a design principle.

496
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,528
We're working now with the World Bank to leverage this,

497
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:29,099
and we're modifying some of their systems

498
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:31,231
to include syntactic and semantic features,

499
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:33,099
as well as these data-superiority features

500
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:34,825
to feed back and close this loop

501
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,462
with their machine-learning outcomes

502
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:38,297
to help them target these companies

503
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:40,330
before they actually commit collusion, corruption,

504
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,297
and fraud, and find them in the database

505
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:44,726
before they get away with tarnishing

506
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,561
our investigative outcomes.

507
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,197
So, I'd like to end the talk with a call to action.

508
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:53,660
This isn't really a new area, and I think these attacks

509
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,924
have been going on for a long time,

510
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:56,462
but it's an area in need of new focus

511
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:59,528
because of our new reliance on these automated reasoning.

512
00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:01,396
I'd like to ask people from industry, academia,

513
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:03,165
and government to help us build a community

514
00:20:03,165 --> 00:20:05,363
around this new idea, help us understand

515
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,264
what sectors are currently experiencing this,

516
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:08,659
whether we understand it or not --

517
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,429
'cause I think it's going on in a lot of places

518
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:12,297
that we're not even aware of --

519
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:15,000
and work with other researchers to help design systems

520
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,363
that have data integrity as a design principle

521
00:20:17,363 --> 00:20:19,231
from the beginning rather than something

522
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,297
we just add on in the end.

523
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:22,462
Thank you very much.

524
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:21,462
