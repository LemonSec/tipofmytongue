1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:05,264


2
00:00:05,264 --> 00:00:07,858
[ Applause ]

3
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:11,891
-Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,363
So, I'm up here speaking,

5
00:00:13,363 --> 00:00:14,759
but this was highly collaborative work

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,264
with the law firm of Stephen Gaffigan

7
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:19,957
and their chief technologist, Sean West.

8
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:21,297
So, before I talk about

9
00:00:21,297 --> 00:00:23,792
bulletproof credit-card-payment processing,

10
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:26,165
I'm first gonna motivate why,

11
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,165
for us as security researchers,

12
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:30,429
it's interesting to study our adversaries

13
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,429
to understand their dependencies

14
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:34,099
and understand intermediaries

15
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:36,791
that are helping out these attackers

16
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:40,891
and perpetrating various kinds of attacks on the Internet.

17
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,165
And I'm gonna do this with a quick anecdotal example

18
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:44,693
from some of the past research

19
00:00:44,693 --> 00:00:47,198
that I and some other researchers have done.

20
00:00:47,198 --> 00:00:48,627
And this was mapping out

21
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:51,693
the dependencies of pharmaceutical spam.

22
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:54,065
And so this example -- There was a botnet.

23
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,924
It sent out some pharmaceutical spam.

24
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:57,627
There were some bulletproof registrars.

25
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:00,066
There were some bulletproof hosting centers.

26
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:02,363
There was a central kind of business entity

27
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,891
that was called an affiliate program,

28
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:06,066
and this affiliate program was paying a commission

29
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,924
to the botnets for every purchase,

30
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:11,099
every customer that they drove

31
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,198
through these pharmaceutical affiliate programs.

32
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,231
These pharmaceutical affiliates were also lining up banks

33
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:17,627
to open up merchant accounts

34
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:18,957
to accept payments

35
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:20,957
for these illicit pharmaceutical goods.

36
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:23,791
They were also contracting with pharmaceutical manufacturers

37
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,759
in India to manufacture

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,594
and deliver these goods into the U.S.

39
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:29,726
So, as you can see,

40
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:31,561
this is a very complicated chain of events.

41
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,957
And most profit-motivated adversaries these days

42
00:01:33,957 --> 00:01:36,231
don't pull off a scam end to end.

43
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,792
There's all of these dependencies,

44
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,396
and if any one of these dependencies fails,

45
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:41,924
essentially the botnet master

46
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:45,528
doesn't get paid their commission for that sale.

47
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:47,594
And so that's kind of the key point is, right,

48
00:01:47,594 --> 00:01:49,000
of trying to understand --

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,363
where's potentially a bottleneck

50
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:54,231
where we could perhaps cut off their profits?

51
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:56,396
And so this is an anecdotal example.

52
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:57,825
We did another example

53
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:01,033
where we looked at close to a billion spam messages,

54
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,396
and we, in fact, found one of these bottlenecks.

55
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:05,825
The bottlenecks that we found was

56
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,627
in the merchant payment processing.

57
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,000
So, we found exactly three banks

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,924
were responsible for collecting payments

59
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,858
for 95% of the spam that we saw.

60
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:16,363
So, for the close to one billion spam messages,

61
00:02:16,363 --> 00:02:18,165
there were just three banks.

62
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:19,560
When we dug into this,

63
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,099
we realized that there were very few banks

64
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,396
that are willing to deal

65
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:26,099
with what's called high-risk merchants.

66
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,363
High-risk, it turns out,

67
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:28,660
if you're selling pharmaceuticals

68
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,495
over the Internet without a prescription,

69
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:32,858
you're at a high risk of getting fines from Visa,

70
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:34,693
you're at a high risk of charge-backs.

71
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,033
And there's very few banks

72
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,494
that are willing to deal with these kind of merchants.

73
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:40,099
The banks that are, are going to insulate themselves from risk.

74
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,066
They're gonna do this by charging a lot of up-front money

75
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:45,330
to protect themselves from those fines from Visa,

76
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,561
and they're gonna do a lot of due diligence to make sure

77
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:49,594
that these illicit pharmaceutical sellers

78
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,561
are good illicit pharmaceutical sellers

79
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,627
and they're not going to -- right? --

80
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:56,594
leave them holding the bag on a lot of charge-backs

81
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,363
and things of that nature.

82
00:02:58,363 --> 00:02:59,924
And so, to contrast this

83
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:02,891
with, say, losing a domain name or hosting

84
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,858
where they can replace these kinds of infrastructure

85
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,363
when they get taken to down minutes to hours

86
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:08,858
for very low amounts of money,

87
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:10,396
when they lose money as merchant accounts,

88
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:12,891
they're losing tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars

89
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:14,329
for each one of these merchant accounts.

90
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,660
And because of due diligence, it's taking them

91
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,132
days to weeks of lost sales to replace this.

92
00:03:20,132 --> 00:03:21,462
And so this was a very --

93
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,560
We published the results of this.

94
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,561
It got a lot of press,

95
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:28,792
and Visa and MasterCard took notice of our findings.

96
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,660
And, in fact, they were willing to help out,

97
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,495
and they enhanced their policing

98
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:35,957
of these illicit merchants.

99
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:38,165
So, how they did this is they changed their agreements

100
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,132
with the bank to elevate the fines.

101
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,660
The fines now start at 25K

102
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,792
for the first illicit-merchant account that Visa finds,

103
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,462
and then they escalate to 100,000K,

104
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:49,792
all the way up

105
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:53,297
to perhaps threatening that bank with disassociation

106
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:54,627
if they don't clean up their act

107
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:57,033
and get rid of these bad merchants.

108
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:01,263
And so with these enhanced fines in place,

109
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,264
some brand holders actually stepped in

110
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:05,033
and tried to reproduce our work.

111
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,231
One of these brand holders

112
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:08,033
was a major pharmaceutical brand holder.

113
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:11,263
The other one was Microsoft, looking at counterfeit software.

114
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:13,429
And they both replicated our methods.

115
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:16,197
And when we looked in the underground forums,

116
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:18,594
we saw that their payment interventions

117
00:04:18,594 --> 00:04:21,957
were having great effect on the spammers.

118
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:23,726
So, they were not too pleased with this.

119
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:26,528
Again, to contrast this with their normal reaction --

120
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:29,033
when people were taking down domain names, hosting,

121
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,330
they were taking down botnets,

122
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,000
you don't see messages like this when that happens.

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,594
This only occurred when we started hammering

124
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,726
their payment-processing end.

125
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:40,594
And this had a great impact on them, virtually eradicated

126
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,296
counterfeit software sales of Microsoft products,

127
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:45,330
and had a large negative impact

128
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,726
on the pharmaceutical spam sales on the Internet.

129
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,264
So, this was right.

130
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:52,165
This was a happy moment as researchers.

131
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,528
So, we had this huge impact, where we had this bottleneck,

132
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,462
Visa and MasterCard were willing to help us,

133
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:58,858
brand holders were willing to help us,

134
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:00,957
and we were having great success.

135
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,858
Unfortunately, after a little while,

136
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:05,363
the brand holders stopped doing

137
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,429
as strict policing of the payment.

138
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:09,561
They kind of backed off of their payment interventions.

139
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:11,758
The spammers noticed that they backed off,

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,066
and once they noticed that they backed off, the coast was clear,

141
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,693
and they ramped back up their operations

142
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:18,264
to where they currently are today.

143
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,726
So, it was kind of a disheartening moment,

144
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:21,891
right, as a researcher

145
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:24,033
'cause we had this really good technique

146
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,231
to undercut these spammers,

147
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:27,726
in terms of these merchant accounts,

148
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:29,297
but we couldn't find a brand holder

149
00:05:29,297 --> 00:05:31,000
that was willing to do these interventions

150
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,099
long term to keep them out.

151
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,066
So, you know, it was a good moment

152
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,857
and a bad moment at the same time.

153
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:39,396
And I was a little bit disappointed 'cause,

154
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:41,231
right, we had this method, but we couldn't find

155
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,198
brand holders to sustain it.

156
00:05:43,198 --> 00:05:46,429
As luck would have it, about two years later,

157
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,494
Stephen Gaffigan and his technologist

158
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:51,396
approached me and said they wanted to re-create this

159
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:53,132
in the luxury-goods space.

160
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:54,627
When they did this, I wanted to make sure

161
00:05:54,627 --> 00:05:55,924
that they were in it for the long haul.

162
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:58,099
I wanted to make sure that they weren't gonna back out

163
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,363
like the other brand holders

164
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:01,660
and that they were gonna be in it for the long haul.

165
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,198
So, they found four luxury brand holders

166
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,462
that said that they were in it.

167
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,033
So, if we could show results,

168
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:11,858
they would keep up the pressure on these luxury counterfeiters.

169
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:14,495
And so, on July 9, 2014,

170
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:16,561
we started doing a payment intervention

171
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:18,066
in the luxury-brand-holder space.

172
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:19,296
These four luxury brand holders --

173
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,429
I can't name them by name.

174
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:22,131
They don't want to be named publicly

175
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,726
because of some operational issues.

176
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:29,164
So, before I talk about our payment intervention,

177
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:30,528
I'm gonna give you a quick primer

178
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,957
on credit-card processing

179
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:34,132
as it's done on the Internet today.

180
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:36,792
And so, right, you begin with a customer -- let's say Alice.

181
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:39,561
Let's say Alice is hungry. She wants a pizza.

182
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:42,000
She finds Joe's Pizza, a merchant online.

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,660
She wants to order a pizza with a credit card.

184
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,528
She types in her credit-card information,

185
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:47,792
and a lot of people probably think

186
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,000
that that credit-card information

187
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,924
goes directly to Joe's Pizza.

188
00:06:50,924 --> 00:06:52,263
In most cases, when you're dealing

189
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:53,693
with a small merchant like this,

190
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,627
it doesn't go directly to Joe's Pizza.

191
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:57,759
It goes to what I call a middleman,

192
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,165
which I'll call a payment processor.

193
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,792
And First Data is an example

194
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,032
of one of these payment processors,

195
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:05,033
largest processor in the world.

196
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,957
And so Joe's Pizza contracts First Data to handle,

197
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:10,759
essentially, all of the details of credit-card processing.

198
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,825
And what First Data does is they go to a bank

199
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:15,924
and they set up what's called an acquiring bank.

200
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:17,198
This is a bank account

201
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:20,263
where they can accept payments for credit cards.

202
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:22,759
And so First Data sets up this bank account

203
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,462
and manages all the details of this.

204
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,066
Joe has no control over this merchant account.

205
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:29,594
It's all handled by First Data.

206
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:32,957
And then when Alice types in her data,

207
00:07:32,957 --> 00:07:35,396
either First Data directly forwards it to the Visa network,

208
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:36,726
or the acquiring bank forwards it

209
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:39,495
into the Visa or MasterCard networks.

210
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:40,858
And when this happens,

211
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:42,330
then the Visa and MasterCard networks

212
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,693
need to correctly route this payment authorization

213
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:48,890
to the issuing bank that issued Alice's credit card --

214
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,429
because Visa and MasterCard don't actually

215
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,296
do any direct settlements of payments.

216
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,462
They just simply maintain a network

217
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:57,033
for acquiring and issuing banks

218
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:59,792
to settle payments between each other.

219
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,198
And so what happens here is,

220
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:03,263
when that customer information from Alice

221
00:08:03,264 --> 00:08:06,000
goes into this network, the first six digits of that

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,132
is what's called the bank identification number.

223
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:09,825
The bank identification number,

224
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:12,066
normally abbreviated as a BIN,

225
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,429
is six digits

226
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:16,131
that essentially identifies the issuing bank

227
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:17,660
of Alice's credit card.

228
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,891
And so with that information, Visa and MasterCard

229
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:22,693
can route it to the correct issuing bank.

230
00:08:22,693 --> 00:08:25,000
When that happens, then that issuing bank can look at it

231
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,693
and either choose to accept or decline that purchase,

232
00:08:27,693 --> 00:08:29,363
based on a number of different factors.

233
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:30,792
Let's say that they accept it.

234
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:33,000
That'll be relayed to the acquiring bank.

235
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,659
The acquiring bank will then relay that to First Data.

236
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,759
First Data will relay that to Joe's Pizza.

237
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,033
Joe's Pizza will cook up a pizza, deliver it,

238
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:43,659
and Alice will be happy and fed.

239
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,957
The other side is in terms of how to trace purchases.

240
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:49,561
When you're doing one of these payment interventions,

241
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,924
you can't just give

242
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:53,528
Visa or MasterCard a URL and say,

243
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,561
"Hey, I want you to shut down the merchant account

244
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,891
for this URL."

245
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,726
In fact, Visa and MasterCard

246
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:01,594
do not have any mapping between the URL

247
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:03,660
and the merchant account at a bank.

248
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,396
What's required here is to do a trace purchase in order --

249
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,231
So, you need to have a successful purchase

250
00:09:09,231 --> 00:09:11,825
where you have that acquiring bank trying to authorize money

251
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:13,297
from an issuing bank.

252
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:17,099
And when that happens, you can actually trace this purchase.

253
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,330
And so this is something

254
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,528
that I have a good deal of experience with.

255
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,891
The law firm contacted me for a reason.

256
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:24,198
They contacted me

257
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:27,165
because I had done close to 800 of these purchases

258
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,132
in the illicit pharmaceutical space

259
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:32,098
and I knew fairly well how to maneuver these systems

260
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:34,561
and get these illicit-goods sellers

261
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:37,792
to actually authorize credit cards.

262
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:41,165
And so with this, we began our payment intervention.

263
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:42,924
The first thing you need to do, right,

264
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:45,858
is you need to find websites

265
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:48,494
that are selling these pharmaceutical goods.

266
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:50,957
In the case of luxury goods, they're all over the place.

267
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,099
They use spam.

268
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,693
They spam online social networks.

269
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,528
They also poison search results.

270
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,693
So, you can just simply type in these search terms,

271
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:01,297
and you'll find a number of sites selling counterfeit goods.

272
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:05,396
In this case, these are compromised universities,

273
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,329
websites that are used, effectively, as doorway pages.

274
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,924
So, they go in, they compromise university websites,

275
00:10:10,924 --> 00:10:12,693
and when you click on one of these results

276
00:10:12,693 --> 00:10:14,264
of these compromised websites --

277
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:17,330
In fact, UCLA is not selling counterfeit Beats by Dre.

278
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,726
They've been hacked,

279
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:21,693
and you'll go to the Beats by Dre store.

280
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:24,561
You'll be redirected to the actual counterfeit-goods store.

281
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,264
So, now a customer can simply navigate this

282
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:28,825
until they wish to purchase.

283
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:31,495
When they want to purchase, they'll normally be redirected

284
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:33,066
to a third-party site.

285
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,033
And these are what I call payment gateways.

286
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:37,726
So, I've purchased a lot of counterfeit goods

287
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,264
on the Internet.

288
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,264
Anyone else that's purchased counterfeit goods in the room

289
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:44,594
has probably seen these two payment gateways.

290
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:45,957
And these two payment gateways

291
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:49,330
map back to two of the middleman payment processors.

292
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,099
They map back to a company called RealyPay

293
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,759
and a company called PayWorks.

294
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,660
Both of these are Chinese credit-card processors.

295
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,429
And when I began this intervention,

296
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:01,660
I really hoped that these Chinese payment processors

297
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,957
were not complicit in this scam.

298
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,792
I hoped that they were being duped by the merchants

299
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,066
and that they really didn't know

300
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,792
the nature of the goods that they were selling.

301
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,858
However, as I did more and more investigation

302
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:14,198
on online forums and talked with these illicit merchants,

303
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:16,462
I found out that, in fact, there's a whole bunch

304
00:11:16,462 --> 00:11:18,000
of these payment processors,

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,495
and, in fact, they are bulletproof.

306
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:23,033
They fully know that they're supporting people

307
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,462
that compromise people's machines,

308
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:26,132
that sell counterfeit goods,

309
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:29,924
and they tailor their services to these kinds of customers.

310
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:31,264
So, we've mapped these out.

311
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:32,561
You can go to underground forums.

312
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,627
You can see when one of these merchants says,

313
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,824
"I want to sell counterfeit goods."

314
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:39,198
Right, some set of these payment processors

315
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,462
will reply and say,

316
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:42,891
"I can offer you the merchant processing

317
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:44,462
for your goods."

318
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:47,660
And I've also contacted them, posing as a merchant.

319
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,957
I've told them I'm going to sell counterfeit goods,

320
00:11:49,957 --> 00:11:51,033
and they're perfectly happy

321
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,528
to supply me with merchant accounts.

322
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:55,924
So, they're very much bulletproof payment processors.

323
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,297
And, again, they tailor their services

324
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,462
to try and protect their merchants

325
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:02,297
from being discovered.

326
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:05,297
And when I initially started the payment intervention,

327
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:07,132
their standard methods

328
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:10,363
were essentially off-the-shelf, anti-fraud-detection methods.

329
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,132
So, there's lots of companies -- third-party companies --

330
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,231
that sell standard fraud detection.

331
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,198
These are meant to insulate merchants

332
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:19,297
from, right, fraudulent purchases,

333
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:20,561
and they kind of have a knob.

334
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:21,693
So, they have a knob

335
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:24,561
where you can have them fairly relaxed,

336
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:27,198
or you can crank up that knob and have them very paranoid.

337
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:30,429
When you crank up that knob and have them fairly paranoid,

338
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:33,560
they'll check your I.P. address to make sure that it matches --

339
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:36,231
geolocates close to the billing address.

340
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:38,627
They'll do address verification,

341
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:41,098
where they check the name and address

342
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:44,132
of the customer's credit card with the issuing bank.

343
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:45,527
And they'll also have things

344
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:47,858
like VPN lists, lists of Tor servers,

345
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:50,726
and they'll block purchases from these.

346
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:52,396
So, these are kind of standard things,

347
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:56,560
that I'm fairly versed with, right, getting purchases

348
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:59,792
that will pass these kind of anti-fraud services.

349
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:02,099
Okay, so, I began, right,

350
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:05,066
my undercover operation as a mystery purchaser

351
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,396
to push through these purchases

352
00:13:07,396 --> 00:13:08,791
from these counterfeit merchants.

353
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,033
And the first technique that I normally use is,

354
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,132
I have an agreement with a prepaid credit-card issuer

355
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:16,329
that will issue prepaid credit cards

356
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,528
in my name and names of other people

357
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:21,429
that have agreed to make purchases for me.

358
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:23,593
And so this was my first attempt.

359
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,792
We went to this prepaid credit-card issuer,

360
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,594
and all the purchases were blocked.

361
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:30,561
So, it's part of that anti-fraud system.

362
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,330
They also had a list of all of the bank identification numbers

363
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,693
of prepaid gift cards,

364
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:37,264
and they were blocking those by default.

365
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:39,462
Okay, so, the next thing that I do is

366
00:13:39,462 --> 00:13:41,528
I have an incorporated company, LLC.

367
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,660
I've opened up a business account

368
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,165
with a major U.S. issuer,

369
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,363
and I issue credit cards to myself

370
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:50,132
and other people that agree to make purchases.

371
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,693
And the problem with this is that there's only one BIN.

372
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:54,231
So, all these credit cards are under one BIN,

373
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:57,000
but it's not a prepaid gift-card BIN.

374
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,825
And so this was successful for about three or four months,

375
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:01,891
before these bulletproof processors --

376
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,858
right, they started getting the fines,

377
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:05,593
and they realized that someone was after them.

378
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,528
They did the analytics. They found out the BIN.

379
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:08,660
They blocked the BIN.

380
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,824
I tested this by recruiting fresh purchasers

381
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,231
that hadn't ever made a purchase,

382
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,231
and they were blocked before their first purchase.

383
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,759
So, this was the beginning of the arms race

384
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,231
with these bulletproof credit-card purchasers.

385
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:22,495
So, they've gone through a list of techniques

386
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,759
to try and block me.

387
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,363
They began blacklisting I.P. addresses.

388
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:29,000
If you live pretty much within a three-mile radius

389
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,594
of where I live in Manhattan,

390
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,759
you probably can't purchase counterfeit goods

391
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,231
'cause I've used all of the coffee shops in the area.

392
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:38,693
So, so sorry.

393
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:40,066
We also started using --

394
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:41,462
Instead of business-class cards,

395
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:44,033
we started using consumer cards that have consumer BINs.

396
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,726
They can't block these BINs outright

397
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:47,033
because this is where the majority

398
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:48,858
of their legitimate customers come from.

399
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,198
So, they began, point-wise,

400
00:14:50,198 --> 00:14:51,891
blocking our credit-card numbers.

401
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,132
They also started blocking our billing address.

402
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:57,495
And I can change all this. So, I can do experiments

403
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,759
changing all of this to see what they're blocking.

404
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,231
However, there's one piece of information

405
00:15:01,231 --> 00:15:03,693
that I can't easily change, and that's my name.

406
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:06,824
So, in fact, they've gone to blacklisting people's names

407
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:08,528
if you continue doing this.

408
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:11,000
And so my name and the names of a lot of my purchasers

409
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,957
are now blacklisted.

410
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:16,066
And so this has made us try and fan out,

411
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:17,627
and I'll talk about how we fan out.

412
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:18,891
The other thing that they've done is

413
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,891
they've injected tracking scripts

414
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:22,957
and device-fingerprinting scripts

415
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:25,099
into their merchandise and their payment gateways.

416
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:26,462
The most effective thing that they did

417
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:27,825
is they looked for the refer.

418
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:29,396
So, they saw how you got

419
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,098
to the counterfeit site in the first place.

420
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,693
Originally, right, we were giving direct URLs

421
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:35,528
to the counterfeit sites, to our purchasers.

422
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,231
They were clicking on the them.

423
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:39,264
The referral was empty.

424
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,858
Virtually no real customer comes directly to these sites.

425
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,132
They come to them through these hacked gateways.

426
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:46,263
So, then we had to train our purchasers

427
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:48,330
to come organically to these websites

428
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,495
through the gateways.

429
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:51,066
Once we did that, interestingly enough,

430
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,561
they removed all the tracking code.

431
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:54,132
They realized that it wasn't effective

432
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:57,560
and it was probably creating false positives on their end.

433
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:01,330
The other thing that they did is they kind of added a few notches

434
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,726
to their anti-fraud system,

435
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:05,165
where, only for certain brands --

436
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,363
the brands that were involved in this payment intervention --

437
00:16:07,363 --> 00:16:08,726
they basically rate-limited them

438
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:10,660
to one purchase, and they were blocked.

439
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,296
I tested this out by purchasing

440
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,528
non-counterfeit goods from these same sites,

441
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:17,330
and they would let those purchases through.

442
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,627
So, they're very well aware of

443
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:20,065
what brand holders are after them,

444
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:22,495
and they've kind of added a few notches

445
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:26,660
to their blocking methods for these particular brands only.

446
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,098
The other thing that they've done

447
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:29,792
that has unfortunately been effective is

448
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:32,627
they've begun sharing customer information

449
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:34,560
between a number of processors.

450
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,231
So, before I join these processors,

451
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:37,726
I have their code.

452
00:16:37,726 --> 00:16:40,594
I can map back which processors are supporting which websites.

453
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:41,891
However, what they started to do

454
00:16:41,891 --> 00:16:43,296
is they started to share this information

455
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:44,660
between processors.

456
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,329
So, before, I carefully -- right, I striped a purchaser

457
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,363
across multiple of these payment processors

458
00:16:49,363 --> 00:16:50,858
so they could at least get one purchase

459
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:52,263
from each payment processor.

460
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:53,858
However, I noticed when they did a purchase

461
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,363
at one payment processor,

462
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:56,660
they weren't just banned from that one.

463
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,132
They were banned from all the ones

464
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:00,462
that were sharing the information with each other.

465
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:02,000
So, I began having to map out

466
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,363
how they were sharing information

467
00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:04,726
and strategically map,

468
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:07,495
between those groups, my purchasers.

469
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,231
And so this obviously, right,

470
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:11,791
has put a lot of pressure on me

471
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:15,197
to kind of expand my network of purchasers

472
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:16,693
larger and larger.

473
00:17:16,693 --> 00:17:19,396
And so originally, right, I had awkward conversations

474
00:17:19,396 --> 00:17:21,890
with my family, my close friends, where I said,

475
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:24,924
"Hey, do you want to purchase some counterfeit goods

476
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:27,132
on your personal credit cards?"

477
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,363
And so of course, right, you're laughing.

478
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:30,792
The thing that a lot of people were worried about

479
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,197
was credit-card fraud.

480
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,264
Ironically enough,

481
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:35,362
these bulletproof credit-card processors

482
00:17:35,363 --> 00:17:36,726
actually don't do fraud.

483
00:17:36,726 --> 00:17:39,924
These are legitimate bulletproof credit-card processors.

484
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,066
They're in the business of payments.

485
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:42,660
They don't do credit card fraud.

486
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,297
So, we've never had an instance

487
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,297
of credit-card fraud from these payment processors.

488
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:51,132
So, while this worry exists, it's hard to get rid of.

489
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:53,231
And so, effectively, I had to take a page

490
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:56,033
from the cybercriminals, and I started an affiliate program,

491
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,924
where I reward people for successful purchases

492
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:01,594
and I reward them for recruiting more and more people

493
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:02,858
into my networks.

494
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,428
So, this has been highly successful,

495
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:05,693
and I have a queue of people,

496
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,956
over 100 purchasers at this point.

497
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:11,000
And so, this has basically rendered null and void

498
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,924
all of their anti-fraud methods at this point.

499
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,264
So, just quickly,

500
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:17,561
here's some results of our payment intervention.

501
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:20,099
So, it's been ongoing for 17 months.

502
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,593
We've again seen this bottleneck of these banks.

503
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:27,066
So, we've seen 3 Chinese banks that process for 97%

504
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,330
of the test purchases that we've completed.

505
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,824
We've mapped out 15 of these payment processors

506
00:18:32,825 --> 00:18:34,033
that are bulletproof.

507
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:37,495
We've completed 313 successful purchases.

508
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:41,561
So, picture a row of tables full of counterfeit goods

509
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:43,131
that we've purchased at this point.

510
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:46,693
We've mapped out 242 unique merchant accounts.

511
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,198
Each one of these has resulted

512
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:51,627
probably in a fine from Visa to that bank.

513
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:53,330
And all of them have either been terminated

514
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,165
or are in the process of being investigated

515
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,956
and will likely be terminated soon.

516
00:18:57,957 --> 00:18:59,792
I've also researched the business model

517
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,362
of these bulletproof payment processors.

518
00:19:02,363 --> 00:19:04,132
So, they operate as they charge you

519
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:08,858
an initial annual subscription fee of about $775.

520
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:10,033
My guess is that

521
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,659
they're actually not making a profit on this.

522
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,132
What they're probably doing with this is,

523
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:15,363
this is turning into an insurance pool

524
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,165
that they're using for fines.

525
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:20,132
So, as long as, right, one out of 40 of these accounts

526
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:21,165
gets mapped out,

527
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:22,924
they pay the fine out of this money.

528
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:24,561
They're perfectly fine with that.

529
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,428
Probably where their profits are coming from

530
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:28,231
is the elevated transaction fees.

531
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:31,066
So, they're paying about twice what a legitimate merchant

532
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:33,660
would pay in terms of credit-card transaction fees.

533
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,264
A legitimate merchant would pay about 2% to 3%.

534
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:38,396
They pay about 4% to 6%.

535
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:41,066
And they don't pass on the fines to the merchants.

536
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:43,297
So, that's covered by the insurance pool

537
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:46,660
of the annual fees.

538
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,033
Okay, so, when we began this,

539
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:51,033
we saw two banks, a Korean bank and the Bank of China.

540
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:52,659
After about three to four months,

541
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,627
the Korean bank stopped issuing accounts to these merchants,

542
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,627
and they started getting accounts

543
00:19:57,627 --> 00:19:59,363
from the other two major Chinese banks --

544
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:01,264
so, the Bank of Communications in China

545
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:03,362
and the Agricultural Bank of China.

546
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:08,792
And these account for 97% of the accounts that we see.

547
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,726
So, to quickly wrap this up,

548
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,792
we found these bulletproof processors

549
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:16,165
that have basically strengthened a weak part

550
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,825
of the spammer infrastructure.

551
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:20,132
They're aiding these spammers by trying to block them,

552
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:23,693
trying to stymie our payment intervention at every step.

553
00:20:23,693 --> 00:20:25,132
We found these three banks

554
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:27,660
that continue to work with these bulletproof processors.

555
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,495
The bank of Korea, right,

556
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:31,792
did something to get rid of these merchants.

557
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:34,528
The banks in China aren't taking similar steps

558
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,528
to get rid of these kinds of merchants.

559
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,363
The other thing that makes this a little bit difficult

560
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,924
is that Visa isn't transparent

561
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:43,363
about the fines that they're fining these banks.

562
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:46,099
So we have no idea if they're escalating the fines.

563
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:48,033
My guess is they aren't escalating the fines,

564
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:50,099
and they clearly haven't disassociated

565
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,099
these large Chinese banks from their payment network

566
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:56,362
'cause that would probably be very difficult for them to do.

567
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,726
So, with that, I show you a picture

568
00:20:58,726 --> 00:21:01,627
of our one victory of RealyPay closing down.

569
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,066
And any questions, please feel free.

570
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,363
[ Applause ]

571
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:11,132
