1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:05,825


2
00:00:05,825 --> 00:00:08,132
-Hi. I'm Elle Armageddon.

3
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:09,462
Thank you so much

4
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:12,065
for having me and all
sitting here to listen to me.

5
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:15,462
There are a lot
of you out there.

6
00:00:15,462 --> 00:00:16,726
Today I actually want to talk

7
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:19,561
about a totally different kind
of horror story

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,033
and a totally different kind

9
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:24,627
of vulnerable user than the ones

10
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:25,825
that Eva and Morgan

11
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,593
discussed and then
the horror stories

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,759
that Yan and Peter discussed.

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,462
I'd like to talk
about average users

14
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:32,792
and how they're vulnerable

15
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:36,396
to relatively
unsophisticated attackers

16
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:39,033
but how that doesn't actually
make those threats

17
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:43,297
less terrifying
or less serious.

18
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:45,924
So, just a quick show of hands.

19
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:49,825
How many people in the audience
have ever had a stalker?

20
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:54,660
That's more of you
than I would like.

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,065
I'm really glad that most of you
haven't had this experience,

22
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,594
because it really,
really, really sucks.

23
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,594
I actually had my first stalker
when I was 16 years old.

24
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:05,693
I was a junior
in high school,

25
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,198
and it was some guy
that I had met

26
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:09,098
over spring break
who was, like, friends

27
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:13,231
with my best friend's former
best friend, and whatever.

28
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,890
And I was just really busy
all the time,

29
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,594
and he was like, "Hey, do
you want to be my girlfriend?"

30
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:19,131
And I was like,
"You know, I'd love to.

31
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:22,825
I just seriously don't have
time for that."

32
00:01:22,825 --> 00:01:24,033
And so he asked
if he could start

33
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:25,462
calling me every once
in a while,

34
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:28,000
and I was like, "Oh, you know,
where's the harm in that? Sure."

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,396
And I gave him
my phone number.

36
00:01:29,396 --> 00:01:30,957
And the next thing
I knew,

37
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,824
this guy was calling me
every single day,

38
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,330
and I would always be, you know,
running out the door

39
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,660
to football practice
or to my job

40
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,264
or to rehearsals for the musical
that I was

41
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:45,594
in or choir rehearsals

42
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:48,065
or any one of the other things
that I was doing,

43
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,891
and so I never really had time
to talk to him.

44
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:53,957
And soon he started getting
kind of angry about it

45
00:01:53,957 --> 00:01:56,297
and demanding more of my time,

46
00:01:56,297 --> 00:01:57,627
and when that didn't play out,

47
00:01:57,627 --> 00:02:01,297
he started showing up places.

48
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:04,396
He started showing up
outside of my job.

49
00:02:04,396 --> 00:02:08,198
He started showing up
on my school campus,

50
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,561
waiting outside of my math class

51
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:11,759
for me to leave,
despite the fact

52
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,957
that he should have also
been in school at that time.

53
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:16,462
And it got really,
really, really scary.

54
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,231
And, eventually, I had to kind
of go to my dad

55
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:20,429
and be like, "Dad,
this guy is really scary,

56
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:22,330
and I don't know what to do,"
and the next time

57
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,132
he called,
my dad was just like,

58
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:26,561
"You better leave
my daughter alone, or else."

59
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,429
And that was the end of it.

60
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:29,924
And the reason
I start with this story

61
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:32,858
is because this was
in the spring of 2002,

62
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:35,165
so this was going on
in my life kind

63
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:39,329
of concurrently with
the launch of Friendster.

64
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,297
This guy had the ability
to track me down

65
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:43,528
and show up places

66
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:45,825
without even having
any information

67
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:47,494
provided on social media,

68
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:48,957
and the existence
of social media

69
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:50,329
has actually made it much,

70
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:54,165
much easier
to track people down.

71
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:56,000
So, there are, fortunately,
a lot of steps

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,165
that you can take to kind
of mitigate some of the danger

73
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:02,660
that you're facing when having
a public-facing face.

74
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,957
That's a lot of faces.

75
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:08,726
Pseudonymity
is a great first step.

76
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:10,594
Choose a public name.

77
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:13,660
Use that public name
publicly all the time.

78
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,429
That is who you are.

79
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,462
The awesome thing
about a public name

80
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:20,494
is that your legal name is
something that was given to you

81
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,495
before anybody had ever met you.

82
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:25,066
They maybe had expectations
of who you would be,

83
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:28,066
but they definitely didn't know
who you would turn out to me.

84
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,033
So, that means
that your legal name

85
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,231
might not actually match
who you are anyway,

86
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,594
and choosing a public name
gives you the opportunity

87
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:37,891
to pick one that does match
who you really are.

88
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,197
It can be as simple as using

89
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:40,957
a shortened version
of your legal name

90
00:03:40,957 --> 00:03:45,528
or using your middle name
in place of your first name

91
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:47,000
or maybe using
your dad's middle name

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,066
in place of your last name
or whatever.

93
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,594
It can be anything you want.
It can be simple like that.

94
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:55,462
It can be choosing
the name Armageddon

95
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:57,957
as your last name.

96
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,429
Whatever it is, make sure
that it's something

97
00:03:59,429 --> 00:04:02,165
that you'll actually respond to.

98
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:04,660
Reserve your legal name
for official things

99
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,297
like signing leases
and other contracts,

100
00:04:07,297 --> 00:04:10,198
signing up for utilities,

101
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:13,033
maybe for applying for jobs,

102
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,231
Thanksgiving dinner,

103
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:17,692
because I can tell you,
no matter how hard you try,

104
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,099
your mother will never
call you "Armageddon."

105
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:24,627
It's also really,
really important to work

106
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:27,792
on not responding when somebody
does use your legal name.

107
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:29,429
So, if you're choosing a name

108
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:32,198
to use publicly
and to use in the world,

109
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:35,330
you definitely want to start
tuning out people

110
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,495
using the wrong name for you,
because that's information

111
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:42,363
that you don't want
publicly available.

112
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:46,231
Disinformation and misdirection
are also really, really helpful.

113
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:50,462
More information
that you put out there

114
00:04:50,462 --> 00:04:55,164
means that people tend to dig
less looking for information.

115
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,429
The information
that you throw out there

116
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,231
doesn't actually have
to be true or honest.

117
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,726
It needs to be consistent.

118
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:05,660
So, if you're talking on three
different social media platforms

119
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,627
about something,
you just want to make sure

120
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:10,231
that it's the same thing that
you're saying across the board

121
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:12,792
rather than maybe telling
the truth one place

122
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,099
and then saying something
totally different

123
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,759
in another place
and, suddenly,

124
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,891
there's this kind of matrix

125
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:22,627
of inconsistent stories
that don't add up,

126
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,825
and now you actually
are interesting to kind

127
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,396
of dig in to.

128
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:30,330
Being mind-numbingly boring
also really helps.

129
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,758
The more pictures
of your lunch

130
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,264
and really boring,
extremely detailed stories

131
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:36,594
about, you know,

132
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:38,165
the line that you were
in at the grocery store

133
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,396
last week,

134
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:41,891
the more trite memes you post,

135
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,462
the more cat pictures
you post --

136
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:45,726
all of these things
make you actually a lot

137
00:05:45,726 --> 00:05:47,099
less interesting to dig

138
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,330
in to and a lot
more difficult to dig

139
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,527
in to because you're just
flooding your own profile

140
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:56,165
with useless information.

141
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:58,099
Subtlety is also key.

142
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,231
If you are going to throw
disinformation out there,

143
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,132
if you are going
to kind of tell some --

144
00:06:03,132 --> 00:06:06,264
some lies about who you are
to avoid having people dig

145
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:08,561
in to who you actually are,

146
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:09,957
you might want to make sure

147
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:11,759
that you're not saying
something like,

148
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,198
"I was a gold medalist
in the Sydney Olympics."

149
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:16,726
I was obviously not
a gold medalist

150
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:18,165
in the Sydney Olympics.

151
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:22,462
I think we would remember
an Armageddon there.

152
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:26,099
Compartmentalization
is also really important.

153
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:28,495
You should consider keeping
your social media profiles

154
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:30,495
separate, especially in cases

155
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:33,000
where you've maybe given
your employers access

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,495
to one of these accounts
but not all of them.

157
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:39,561
Use different handles if
you'd like to compartmentalize,

158
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:40,825
because using different handles

159
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,363
makes it a lot harder
to kind of connect

160
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,594
the dots between
these different profiles.

161
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:48,296
And use unique e-mail
addresses, as well.

162
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:49,693
I started talking
about social media

163
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:52,231
self-defense kind of right

164
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:55,000
after the Ashley Madison
breach happened,

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,627
because it turned out
that it was a great example

166
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:02,627
of what not to do using
social media of any kind.

167
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:06,165
People were using
their .gov e-mail addresses

168
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,264
to sign up for this dating site,

169
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,660
the premise of which was
cheating on your partner,

170
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,429
and when that data gets dumped,

171
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:14,561
it's really easy to kind
of put two and two together,

172
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:16,594
and now you've got everybody
in your office looking at you

173
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:22,693
like, "Buddy, I don't judge,
but oh, my God."

174
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,231
It's also kind of a good idea

175
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,561
when compartmentalizing to think

176
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,527
about what you want
linked together

177
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:29,363
and what you don't
want linked together.

178
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:32,132
I've put up a couple examples

179
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:35,264
of theoretical e-mail addresses

180
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:37,792
for my Facebook login,
my Twitter login,

181
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,131
and dating-site login.

182
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:42,561
You'll notice that the Facebook

183
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,890
and Twitter e-mails
are really similar.

184
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:46,495
They're different but similar

185
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:49,825
so that if Facebook and Twitter
were both hacked tomorrow

186
00:07:49,825 --> 00:07:52,462
and all of their user data
was dumped,

187
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:54,659
you would probably be
able to figure out

188
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,066
that that was the same person
across both sites.

189
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,857
The dating-site one
is totally different,

190
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:05,429
because if they were also hacked
in this massive, catastrophic,

191
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:09,131
apocalyptic
social media data dump,

192
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:11,891
I maybe wouldn't want
my dating site to be linked

193
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,825
to my Twitter
and my Facebook.

194
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:16,132
It's also a good idea

195
00:08:16,132 --> 00:08:19,792
to fabricate unique personally
identifying information.

196
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,561
Social media sites
want your date of birth,

197
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:23,594
they want your legal name,
they want your address,

198
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,000
they want to know
where you went to high school,

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,297
and they don't need that.

200
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:28,924
That's your information.

201
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:30,693
You get to choose
how it gets used

202
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,000
and how has it,

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,033
and there's no need
to actually hand it over

204
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:37,858
to any social media profile
or any social media site,

205
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:39,924
no matter how much
they want it.

206
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,264
Another aspect
of compartmentalization

207
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,231
is maintaining
a professional life

208
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:48,099
and a personal life.

209
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,429
If you can possibly
help it,

210
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,231
don't share
your social media profiles

211
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,066
with your coworkers.

212
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,165
Definitely don't share them
with your boss.

213
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,495
That is definitely not
within the scope

214
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:03,000
of professional relationships
in most cases,

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,297
and it's super not necessary.

216
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:06,660
If you are in a scenario

217
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,957
where you feel
like it's necessary,

218
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:10,660
consider creating
a work-specific profile

219
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
and maintaining
a personal profile, as well,

220
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,429
rather than kind of blending
the two and hoping for the best.

221
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,033
Do not use your work e-mail
for your personal accounts.

222
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:21,429
I kind of mentioned
this a little bit

223
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,198
earlier with people
using .gov e-mail addresses

224
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,660
to sign up for Ashley Madison.

225
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,000
That's really bad.
It's super embarrassing.

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,528
Just don't do it.

227
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,924
And also remember
that whatever you say publicly

228
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:33,693
can hurt you professionally.

229
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:35,891
If it's possible
for me to track down

230
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,593
where it is that you work

231
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,429
and you've said
something really shitty,

232
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,593
it's also possible
for me to go to your supervisor

233
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,627
and be like, "This guy
said something really shitty.

234
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:45,891
Are you sure that's
who you want to employ?"

235
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:48,660
So it's a good idea to kind
of keep all of that separate

236
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
and just remember that
what you say can hurt you

237
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,264
if people have the information
to do that.

238
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:56,957
Choose your photos
really carefully.

239
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:59,165
Beware of reverse image search.

240
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,363
If you're trying
to keep profiles separate,

241
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:02,693
you want to kind of make sure

242
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:05,593
that you're not making
it super easy by,

243
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:11,330
you know, having the same
profile picture in both.

244
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,528
In fact, don't use
the same pictures in profiles

245
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:15,066
that you want
to keep separate at all.

246
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:18,825
Reverse image search sucks,
and it will fuck you up.

247
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:22,033
If you're unsure of
whether or not to use a picture,

248
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,033
dump it into reverse
image search first

249
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,330
and see what it turns up.

250
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,627
Maybe it's totally fine.

251
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,231
Maybe it's not.
It's worth checking.

252
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:31,627
Never attach your face
to profiles

253
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:36,726
that you do not want linked
to your personal identity.

254
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:39,033
So, if you decide
that you want to have

255
00:10:39,033 --> 00:10:42,759
this compartmentalized profile

256
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,792
on a dating site, for example,

257
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,330
don't put pictures
of your face on it.

258
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,297
It is way, way, way too easy
to track people down

259
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:50,957
using pictures of their face

260
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:52,792
and connect the dots.

261
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,297
Also, because we're talking
about public names

262
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:56,561
versus legal names,

263
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:58,396
don't attach your face
to your legal name

264
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,396
if you can help it.

265
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:02,231
The DMV
will obviously have this.

266
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:04,033
That's unavoidable.

267
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,561
But, in general, it's kind
of not really necessary

268
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:10,528
to attach your face
to your legal name

269
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:12,693
if you have a public name,
as well.

270
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:18,000
Keeping secrets
is also really important.

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,528
Secrets are not secrets

272
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,858
once they're shared,
even with one person,

273
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:23,329
because you have no guarantee

274
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,726
that it's not gonna travel
farther than that one person.

275
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:29,033
Good intentions
can't stop thoughtless comments,

276
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,000
so no matter how much
you trust someone,

277
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,330
that doesn't mean that
they're never going to get drunk

278
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,429
and accidentally spill
your secret to somebody

279
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:37,693
who's really interested
in hearing it.

280
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:40,098
And once it's out,
you really can't get it out --

281
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,363
or get it back.

282
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:45,726
As one might say,
"The cats are out of the bag."

283
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:47,891
The Internet does not forget.

284
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:49,231
So, if your secret is out

285
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,429
and also on the Internet,
you're really screwed.

286
00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:53,660
It's there forever.

287
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,296
Keep it secret.
Keep it safe.

288
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,396
Tell nobody if it actually needs
to stay a secret.

289
00:11:58,396 --> 00:12:01,032
And if somebody does kind
of confront you

290
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:02,396
about something
that you don't want

291
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:04,462
to talk about...

292
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:07,627
Whoops.

293
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,924
I have a fantastic example

294
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,957
of how to answer
those questions.

295
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:20,693
-Do you recall
that any criminal acts --

296
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,924
actions --
were pending against you

297
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:25,264
at the end of 2008?

298
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:26,594
-I don't recall any.

299
00:12:26,594 --> 00:12:29,066
-Do you recall being
at all concerned

300
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:31,297
about any criminal actions

301
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,462
that may have been pending
against you at the end of 2008?

302
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,000
-I don't recall.

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,891
-Do you recall
that in the summer of 2007,

304
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,231
you were arrested
in New York City

305
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:44,462
following a performance
at the Beacon Theatre?

306
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:47,858
-I don't recall that.

307
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:50,824
-And so the reason you say,
"I don't recall that"

308
00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:52,132
is because then

309
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:54,924
if somebody comes back
with photographic evidence,

310
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:57,297
you haven't just said,
"No, that never happened."

311
00:12:57,297 --> 00:12:59,264
You said,
"I don't remember shit."

312
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:02,033
This is actually
a really important distinction.

313
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:03,330
It's really,
really difficult

314
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,660
to prove that you do,
in fact, remember something.

315
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,165
It's really easy to prove
that you did something.

316
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,429
So, yeah, not remembering is,

317
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,000
in a lot of cases,
your best defense

318
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,297
when you don't want
to discuss something.

319
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,957
Oh, for heaven's sake.

320
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:29,462
Threat modeling
is also really important.

321
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:31,429
Deciding what it is
that you want to keep

322
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,891
from the public eye
has a lot to do

323
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:35,296
with what it is

324
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:38,066
that you're afraid
of experiencing in your life.

325
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:40,726
Nobody knows your threat model
better than you do.

326
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,693
There are a lot of people
who will tell you that they do,

327
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:43,528
but they're wrong.

328
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:44,495
Don't listen to them.

329
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:46,066
You know what you're up against

330
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:48,264
better than anybody
in the world.

331
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:49,825
Threat modeling
also isn't actually

332
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:51,396
about telling you what to do.

333
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,660
It's about helping you decide
how to go about it.

334
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,000
It's about helping you decide
how to mitigate the damage

335
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,561
that you may be doing
to yourself

336
00:13:57,561 --> 00:13:59,429
rather than preventing you
from living the life

337
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,065
that you want to live.

338
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:05,000
The idea behind threat modeling
is to live safely.

339
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,561
It's not to let
the concept of safety

340
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:11,528
prevent you from having
a real life.

341
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:15,198
Communication is also really,
really, really important.

342
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,297
Your privacy is only as good
as your friends' privacy,

343
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:19,825
so you want to make sure
that your friends

344
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,561
know not to hand out
your social information.

345
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:24,759
You want to make sure
that they know not

346
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,297
to hand out
your phone number to people

347
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:29,396
just because they've asked
or your e-mail address to people

348
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:30,957
just because they've asked.

349
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,759
One of my preferred methods
of dealing with this is saying,

350
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,297
"I would be happy to pass
your information on to them,"

351
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:41,594
rather than just
handing it over.

352
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:43,000
You might have
different preferences,

353
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,429
but whatever
those preferences are,

354
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,329
make sure that you're
telling them to people

355
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,429
as you're sharing
your information with them

356
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,528
so that they can respect
those preferences.

357
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:53,528
Also talk
to your friends about tagging.

358
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:55,891
Friends do not tag friends

359
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:57,462
in publicly viewable photos

360
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:59,264
of them doing
embarrassing things.

361
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,891
That's just not a thing.
But talk about it.

362
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:04,329
Let them know that
you really don't want that.

363
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,330
And, also,
don't stay silent.

364
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,660
If you are actually facing
the threat of being stalked,

365
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,363
if you are facing
an abusive partner,

366
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:15,429
if you're facing
an abusive work dynamic

367
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:17,297
or your parents
are spying on you

368
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:19,759
or whatever it is,
don't stay silent.

369
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,297
Talk to people about that
that you trust,

370
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,429
because it's really important
to remember

371
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:27,329
that people use silence
in abusive dynamics

372
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,330
to perpetuate
those abusive dynamics

373
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:32,858
rather than having to face
any kind of accountability.

374
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:35,329
As soon as you start bringing
more people

375
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,957
in for an accountability
process, the more likely

376
00:15:37,957 --> 00:15:40,330
you are to actually get
that issue addressed.

377
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,198
So, what can you guys do?

378
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,528
If you're not actually
directly facing these threats,

379
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:51,132
don't make assumptions
about the threats

380
00:15:51,132 --> 00:15:52,593
that other people are facing.

381
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:56,693
How many of you had ever
considered social media

382
00:15:56,693 --> 00:16:00,891
being used to stalk somebody
that you know before this talk?

383
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,891
That's good.

384
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:07,033
It's not enough.

385
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:10,330
So don't make assumptions
about what threats people face.

386
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,033
Especially don't make
assumptions about the threats

387
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,627
that your users face.

388
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:17,132
Do talk to your users
about their concerns.

389
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,527
Most of the time,
if you ask people, "Hey,

390
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,099
what are you worried about?

391
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,759
Where do you see
this potentially going wrong?"

392
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,858
you can,
at the very least, get an idea

393
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:27,758
of where they're coming from,
what they're facing,

394
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,825
and what they'd like
to see done to protect them.

395
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,528
Keep the lines
of communication open

396
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:34,462
so users can
bring concerns to you,

397
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:36,825
even if you're not
directly asking,

398
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,363
and believe your users

399
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,858
when they tell you
that they're worried.

400
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:42,858
Believe them when they tell you
that they're scared.

401
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:44,329
There's a reason
that they're opening up

402
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,066
to some total stranger

403
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,891
about how terrified they are,

404
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:49,924
and it's worth listening to.

405
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:56,660
If anybody has other questions,
you can contact me on Twitter.

406
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,593
You can e-mail
at me armageddon@riseup.net

407
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:01,726
You can also see a lot

408
00:17:01,726 --> 00:17:04,329
of the social media
self-defense advice

409
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,066
that I've written up
at blog.totallynotmalware.com.

410
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,726
Oops! No.
That's not the right URL.

411
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:12,924
blog.totallynotmalware.net.

412
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:14,627
It's totally legit, I swear.

413
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:13,627
