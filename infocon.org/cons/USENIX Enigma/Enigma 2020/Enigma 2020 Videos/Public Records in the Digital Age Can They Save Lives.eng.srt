and being a part of this conversation

16
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:50,600
recently BuzzFeed news published an

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,579
article highlighting how a majority of

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,680
online dating apps enables sex offenders

19
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:56,930
to use their platform in this piece they

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,489
showcased a survey where 31% of female

21
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,149
respondents disclosed being sexually

22
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:03,680
assaulted by an online date 31% there

23
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,660
are roughly 40 million Americans using

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,820
online dating today forty seven point

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,280
six percent of them female that's about

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,508
19 million women if we take this 31

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,729
percent statistic to the broader

28
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:15,229
population that's over five million

29
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,720
women who have been sexually assaulted

30
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:19,700
by an online date according to the CDC

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,860
epidemics occur when an agent and

32
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,599
susceptible hosts are President adequate

33
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,069
numbers and the agent can be effectively

34
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,090
conveyed from a source to the

35
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:30,679
susceptible hosts more specifically an

36
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,479
epidemic may result from factors that

37
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:33,890
increase host exposure or involved

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,780
introduction through nua portals of

39
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,179
entry in this case the online dating

40
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,560
apps themselves second in the Hance mode

41
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:42,500
of transmission so that more susceptible

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,640
persons are exposed previously an abuser

43
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
could only talk to one or two

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,610
individuals simultaneously thanks to

45
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,920
digital platforms they can be

46
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,709
communicating with dozens of potential

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,390
victims and third a change in the

48
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,890
susceptibility of the hosts response to

49
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,750
the agent previously our networks were

50
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,200
connected in person we knew each other

51
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,459
and our whisperer networks worked today

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,470
victims may not know each other and we

53
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:05,929
have no way of knowing who who were

54
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,119
actually meeting dating apps have

55
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:10,520
created a digital violence epidemic

56
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,370
against women and vulnerable populations

57
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,870
but they are not the only ones I'm sure

58
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,819
many of you read Ebers recent safety

59
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,290
report were over 3,000 individuals

60
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,649
revealed being sexually assaulted in

61
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,209
2018 alone from finding love to finding

62
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,040
a ride we're connecting with more

63
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,069
strangers than ever before and well the

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,870
Internet has created a

65
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,969
it's amount of good it's also a left us

66
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,920
open to a ripe opportunity for a global

67
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:34,829
epidemic of violence against women and

68
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,429
vulnerable populations how did this

69
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,980
happen

70
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:43,950
and how do we prevent headlines like

71
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:46,290
these from occurring in order to end

72
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,649
this epidemic we have to do something

73
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:51,000
dramatic culture shifting but first we

74
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,099
have to understand the systems that

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,930
enable it today we're gonna talk about

76
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,849
the criminal justice system and public

77
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,290
record laws that enable perpetrators to

78
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,659
keep perpetuating violence while

79
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,040
silencing survivors we're then gonna

80
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,828
discuss how we can use the current

81
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,629
records records and laws to proactively

82
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,040
prevent crimes by providing transparent

83
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,439
access to information and show that

84
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,480
access to public records can in fact

85
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:18,030
save lives today one in five women and

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,530
one in 71 men will be the victims of

87
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,019
sexual assault at some point in their

88
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,719
lives who are the ones committing these

89
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,790
offences thanks to me too and other

90
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,680
movements were likely to know who the

91
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,000
victims are of these crimes we have very

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,939
little information on who actually

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,769
perpetuates this violence we know that

94
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,629
the average rapist has ten victims by

95
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,370
the time they're college aged there

96
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,500
aren't a lot of rapists but rapists rape

97
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,090
a lot domestic violence follows the same

98
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,159
trend where a small number of abusers

99
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,329
commit a large number of crimes we're

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,698
also finding in recent studies that

101
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,109
domestic violence or that rapists commit

102
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:52,470
a large number of other violent acts

103
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:54,349
including domestic violence how did we

104
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,930
get the system that perpetuates

105
00:03:54,349 --> 00:04:00,238
perpetrators let's start with the crime

106
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,069
funnel the crime funnel is a visual

107
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,900
representation of how a crime makes its

108
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:05,458
way through the justice system as you

109
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,379
can see less than half of all crimes are

110
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,849
reported to the police of those reported

111
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,929
less than 1% will end in conviction how

112
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,899
did this happen

113
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,250
I don't know but it's even worse for

114
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,918
gender-based violence and sexual assault

115
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,079
where only 23 percent of crimes are

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,000
reported that means that three-quarters

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,710
of crimes are never reported and there's

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,360
a wide variety of reasons people choose

119
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,909
not to report whether that's fear of

120
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,320
retaliation fear of the police or just

121
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:34,080
wanting to keep a personal incident

122
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,699
private but those who do report it's

123
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,969
like preventing the next victim as their

124
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,680
number one reason for reporting however

125
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:41,380
we just learned

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,580
less than 1% of violent crimes will

127
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,060
gender-based violence will end in

128
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:50,599
convictions why does the crime funnel

129
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,919
exist there's a ton of reasons honestly

130
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,460
but it can really be boiled down to two

131
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,020
main points an overburden system and an

132
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,330
indifference too hard to solve crimes

133
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,070
when it comes to an overburden system we

134
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,719
tend to think of it from the public

135
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,639
defender perspective but we need to flip

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,830
this and think of it from the victims

137
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,900
perspective right now we're busy with

138
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,479
crimes against society that are

139
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,758
victimless like marijuana offenses and

140
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:15,889
loitering we have an overburdened system

141
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,900
because of these types of offenses we're

142
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,789
busy fighting a war on poor people and

143
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,130
crimes against society rather than

144
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:26,599
ending a domestic violence epidemic and

145
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,729
we've tried to solve this problem for

146
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:30,349
centuries using a whisper network a

147
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,150
whisper networks an informal chain of

148
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:34,729
information passed between individuals

149
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,710
usable usually privately and between

150
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:38,900
women and there's been some recent

151
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,210
attempts at digital whisper networks

152
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,679
including the shitty media men list and

153
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,900
India's seen and heard which has

154
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,510
published alleged abuse in India's art

155
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,590
world since 2018 the creators of these

156
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,570
lists have gone through a lot of

157
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,070
scrutiny the shitty media men list

158
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,900
crater was outed and it's currently

159
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,849
being sued by one of the men on the list

160
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,830
India's seen and heard is also currently

161
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:59,900
in court although they are the identity

162
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,419
of the person behind the account has yet

163
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,888
to be revealed

164
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,659
the problem with whisper networks is

165
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,800
that you also have to be in the know you

166
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:08,840
have to know someone who knows someone

167
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,849
who knows someone's past behavior and

168
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,619
thanks to our online networks now we

169
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:17,360
don't tend to know people anymore in

170
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:19,009
that capacity how are we supposed to

171
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,080
stop serial abusers and protect

172
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:23,389
ourselves if we don't know who the

173
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,710
offenders are the current system allows

174
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,630
perpetrators to slip through the cracks

175
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,219
and then we obfuscate the records by

176
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,280
hiding them behind FOIA requests

177
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,620
paywalls and other obstacles let's talk

178
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,539
about the public record problem today

179
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,550
public records can broadly be defined as

180
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,530
a record required to be maintained and

181
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,380
kept or a record filed in a public

182
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,729
office but depending on the state access

183
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,229
to this information will be heavily

184
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:47,000
heavily limited for example here in

185
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,800
California the California Public Records

186
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,440
Act states that except for explicit

187
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,570
exception

188
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,070
personal information maintained about an

189
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,680
individual may not be disclosed without

190
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,909
that person's consent but public records

191
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,590
didn't start with personal information

192
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,350
they started to hold our government

193
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,969
accountable to its people that's why in

194
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,340
1950 the federal Records Act was the

195
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,960
first act in the United States to

196
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,390
provide the legal framework for record

197
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,650
maintenance and management but many

198
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,870
people thought it didn't go far enough

199
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,090
which is why in 1966 the Freedom of

200
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,440
Information Act was passed the FOIA was

201
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,690
enacted to make government agents

202
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,100
agencies functions more transparent so

203
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,410
the American people could hold the

204
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,180
government accountable a lot has

205
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,180
happened since then but most recently we

206
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,350
have the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016

207
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,180
this Act addressed the proactive

208
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,280
disclosures requiring agencies to make

209
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,680
available for public inspection in an

210
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,830
electronic format any record requested

211
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,870
three or more times

212
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,000
public records can be a wide variety of

213
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,890
things from marriage certificates birth

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,650
certificates death certificates court

215
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,630
orders arrest records government

216
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,030
financial information and so much more

217
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,340
but the problem is this information is

218
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,710
really hard to find and even harder to

219
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,200
use today and if it is available online

220
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,390
it often costs up to ninety five dollars

221
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,390
per search to requite the information

222
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,280
how are we creating a system that holds

223
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,500
perpetrators accountable and makes our

224
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,630
government transparent if we cannot find

225
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,670
easy access to this information and it

226
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,710
takes months to get it and cost a ton of

227
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:22,680
money the public information that is

228
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,299
available today is insanely creepy how

229
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,860
many of you have used truth finders

230
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,000
bokya our instant checkmate raise your

231
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,830
hand not a lot of you I highly highly

232
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,870
suggest that you do we're actually gonna

233
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,949
walk through a little video clip of me

234
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,940
running myself through one of these

235
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,890
systems

236
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,380
it actually takes about 20 to 30 minutes

237
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,760
to use these systems and we'll see the

238
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,080
process it's only a two and a half

239
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,080
minute clip that I'll talk through

240
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:57,199
so right here I'm searching my own name

241
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:58,670
this is instant checkmate first it asked

242
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:01,729
if I'm male or female it doesn't know

243
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,959
and it has a consumer report notice that

244
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,889
it can't be used for business purposes

245
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,420
which is understandable and then it

246
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:14,000
starts with all of these pop-ups am i

247
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,819
over 40 years old do you think I've been

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,440
charged with a felony

249
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,100
do I have secret social media accounts

250
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,230
and this is again as a 20 minute loading

251
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,199
screen right now and then they say they

252
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:29,899
have my report and then guess what

253
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:31,550
another loading screen and they ask even

254
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,220
more questions do you suspect I have a

255
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,719
criminal record

256
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,029
this helps them perform the accuracy of

257
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:43,610
their results supposedly do you suspect

258
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:50,870
I've ever gotten a DUI then they run

259
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:54,230
through your social media accounts even

260
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,720
more loading screens and alerts right

261
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,670
they contain surprising details provided

262
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,410
by users so anyone can comment on your

263
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:05,329
profile at any time anything that they

264
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:09,050
would like to Catharines report may

265
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:12,189
contain graphic content and it's a

266
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:18,939
secure access to this graphic content

267
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:18,940
another loading screen another button

268
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:32,629
another loading screen again a warning

269
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:37,939
content may be graphic how many times do

270
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:39,949
we have to hear this and there's my

271
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,329
report and wants me to pay $35 for the

272
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,839
search but if you wait 20 minutes on

273
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:47,059
that screen it'll go to only a dollar

274
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,759
and then there's my mom it's not even me

275
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,509
that's my mom but there does have every

276
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:56,319
phone number I've ever registered every

277
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:59,600
email address I've ever registered and

278
00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:01,670
then most creepily well besides leaving

279
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,279
a comment it has all of my location data

280
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,540
every home address I've ever registered

281
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,369
today I cannot vote because I'm afraid

282
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,379
that these systems will enable my abuser

283
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:11,540
to see that my address and continue

284
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:12,860
stalking me and then it has sex offender

285
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,799
data which is the easiest data to

286
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,749
maintain and have available and then

287
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:20,959
finally it ends with a dark web scan

288
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:24,499
right so fear monger you even more in

289
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,929
this process right how do they get this

290
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:29,209
information they get it through public

291
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:31,819
records like marriage records and DMV

292
00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:34,099
records in fact here in California DMV

293
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:36,709
makes over fifty million dollars a year

294
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,329
selling your personal data how can the

295
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,849
California Public Records Act states

296
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:41,988
that except for explicit exceptions

297
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,579
personal information maintained about an

298
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:45,379
individual may not be revealed without

299
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:47,269
that person's consent yet they're buying

300
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,910
and selling your personal data every day

301
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,799
how can organizations buy and sell your

302
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,660
personal data but we cannot gain access

303
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:58,129
to the public records that can save our

304
00:11:53,660 --> 00:12:00,589
lives and it's not just public

305
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:02,419
information found in public records its

306
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,220
osek data or open source intelligence

307
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:07,549
data that can be found in social media

308
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,679
posts web blogs newspapers

309
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:11,809
images be everything and increase this

310
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:14,809
digital paper trail of our beliefs and

311
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:16,939
our behaviors and the way that they're

312
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,399
using this information is dangerous as

313
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:22,790
you just saw not protective it can lead

314
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,110
to daxing stalking and death daxing in

315
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,819
case you didn't know is the publishing

316
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,339
of private information usually with

317
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:31,699
malicious intent how do I know about

318
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:34,129
daxing because two years ago I was doxed

319
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:35,740
by an abusive ex-boyfriend he published

320
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,300
dozens of posts that started ranking

321
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,130
number one on my Google search results

322
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,530
to get these posts removed it cost

323
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,930
between three hundred and three thousand

324
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,449
dollars if you go to their legal threats

325
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:48,729
page it stated section 230 of the

326
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,800
Communications Decency Act I didn't know

327
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,500
what it was at the time so I went

328
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,569
searching the CDA says no provider or

329
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,250
user of an interactive computer service

330
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,290
shall be treated as the publisher or

331
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,600
speaker of any information provided by

332
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,520
another information content provider it

333
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,920
essentially means that platforms are not

334
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:10,449
responsible for what their users do and

335
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,790
say on the platform itself and that's

336
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,670
where I created Garbo I thought that if

337
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:18,069
these platforms could publish personal

338
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,449
information and and total lies about

339
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,050
someone and ruin lives

340
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:25,630
why can't we publish public records

341
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,520
about these abusers and that's how

342
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,720
Garvin was born Garbo was a new kind of

343
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,220
background check designed for the

344
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,170
digital age we're on a mission to

345
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,180
proactively prevent gender-based crimes

346
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,540
by providing transparent access to

347
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,550
information we do this by unlocking

348
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,829
records that are hidden behind FOIA

349
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:45,280
requests and paywalls and providing them

350
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:47,740
to users for free we're building a

351
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,780
national crime web the first of its kind

352
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,450
that enables people to search across

353
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,010
jurisdictions and find someone if that

354
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,870
you're seeing in California has the

355
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,510
record in New York and everything in

356
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,520
between

357
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:02,319
our database contains both oesn't and

358
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,300
public information including orders of

359
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,250
protection court records arrest records

360
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,510
media reports and Equal Employment

361
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,940
Opportunity Commission complaints second

362
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,220
we allow users to search before the

363
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,320
first meeting which is so so crucial

364
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,960
nowadays because we're meeting so many

365
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,820
strangers we use the limited information

366
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,440
that people might have before that first

367
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,840
meeting like just a first name and phone

368
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,520
number or license plates we then do a

369
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,170
reverse look-up on this technology if

370
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,850
the first name registered to that phone

371
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,640
number matches what's in what you input

372
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:37,480
we then provide access to the available

373
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,610
reports that we have on that user as you

374
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,770
can see here there's the submit evidence

375
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,150
button garble is the first online

376
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,770
background check designed to accept

377
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,569
submissions of real records and reports

378
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,790
that our systems may have missed that

379
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,450
includes police reports orders of

380
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,620
protection

381
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,890
an Equal Employment Opportunity

382
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:56,770
Commission complaints we do this through

383
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:59,710
a simple encrypted web form that follows

384
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,150
section 230 rights so we take all this

385
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,650
information about the perpetrator and

386
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,590
automatically publish it to their

387
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:12,430
profile while maintaining the victims

388
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:13,660
secrecy and identity Garbo is a new kind

389
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,530
of background check designed for the

390
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,030
digital age

391
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,170
we believe in providing transparent

392
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,329
access to information around

393
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,219
gender-based violence including sexual

394
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,010
assault domestic violence and sexual

395
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,800
harassment speaking of sexual harassment

396
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,510
we can revolutionize the way that job

397
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,699
interviewees have power over their

398
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,770
companies by knowing before a job

399
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,840
interview if the employer has any EEOC

400
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:39,760
complaints against them you can truly

401
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,380
begin to save lives we want to make sure

402
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,830
that everyone is making informed

403
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,360
decisions about their safety

404
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:48,820
survivors take a big often dangerous

405
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,650
step by coming forward and they mostly

406
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,620
do it to protect the next victim

407
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,060
why wouldn't we make that a reality why

408
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,820
wouldn't we create a transparent system

409
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,020
that holds the systems and the

410
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,210
individuals accountable for their

411
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,180
actions by providing transparent access

412
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,790
to information but Garbo is built on

413
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,680
broken systems from the crying funnel

414
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,689
where less than 1% of police reports any

415
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,170
convictions to the records hidden behind

416
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:16,240
FOIA requests and paywalls in order to

417
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,620
actually end this epidemic and make

418
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,980
change we have to change three

419
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:24,340
fundamental principles first we must

420
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,860
redefine public records to be any record

421
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,960
filed in a public office from the very

422
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,610
top of the crime funnel and then we must

423
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,200
do this while protecting survivors

424
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,920
themselves and these records should be

425
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,930
easily accessible and free to access

426
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,310
second we have to shift privacy laws we

427
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,140
have to make personal identifying

428
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,339
information like your home address and

429
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,980
your email and your phone number

430
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,630
harder to access we also need to provide

431
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,000
transparent access to the information

432
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,640
organizations do have on us and how they

433
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,050
got that information finally we need to

434
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,610
overhaul section 230 of the

435
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,410
Communications Decency Act ensure

436
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,670
internet is designed to protect every

437
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,540
individual including the most

438
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:03,110
marginalized populations we must hold

439
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,220
companies liable for the

440
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,319
that occurs on their platform until the

441
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,569
systems as they are fixed Garbo will

442
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,220
exist but together we can end this

443
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,709
epidemic if you would like to volunteer

444
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,530
with us or contribute in any way please

445
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:21,640
visit me afterwards or visit Garbo I oh

446
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,639
thank you so much
