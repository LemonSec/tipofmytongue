1
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,470
hello everyone thank you for having me

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,470
here to talk about something that's not

3
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:25,320
impeachment it's really delightful I'm

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,880
Mika o yang here's how you can find me

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,628
if you are interested in my opinions on

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:37,350
other things including fiber um so in

7
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:39,660
May of 2019 the city of Baltimore was

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,750
hit by a cyber attack for the second

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,080
time they found their emergency services

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,629
shut down for 17 hours they had to start

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,690
responding to things manually while a

12
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,820
hacker demanded that they pay 13 Bitcoin

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,440
in order to nearly eighty thousand

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,879
dollars in order to be able to get the

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,479
ransom or their data would be deleted

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,349
forever like thousands of cities across

17
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,229
the country

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,690
Baltimore decided not to pay the ransom

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:08,429
but instead to try and fix the problem

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,560
themselves they spent millions in

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,790
remediation

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,250
but in Baltimore what we discovered is

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,020
that the the exploit that you was used

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,490
or they kicked off a debate about the

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,479
whether or not the exploit that was used

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,449
to target Baltimore was actually one

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,680
developed by the NSA as part of their a

28
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:32,640
series that's what that was stolen by

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,890
the shadow brokers so Baltimore started

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,350
blaming NSA NSA started blaming

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,820
Baltimore saying you guys didn't patch

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,710
Baltimore's like you guys shouldn't be

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,360
developing these offensive tools you had

34
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,320
these accusations flowing up and down

35
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,530
the BW Parkway

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,380
but in this conversation as we're

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,110
throwing blame on both sides we're

38
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,850
leaving out the one person who is

39
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,850
unquestionably to blame here the

40
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,710
individual who is sitting there waiting

41
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,750
for the Bitcoin to flow into their

42
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:09,239
wallet we're not thinking about the

43
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,889
individual behind the attack sadly

44
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,140
Baltimore story is also common it's

45
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,540
replicated in thousands of cities across

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,890
and businesses across the country and we

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,709
continue to blame users for not avoiding

48
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,869
clicking on every phishing link for

49
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,120
operators for not updating and patching

50
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,829
promptly for developers for having

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,220
exploitable vulnerabilities in their

52
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:32,520
code

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,720
when a cyber crime or breach becomes

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,000
public the response all too often is to

55
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,609
blame the victim it is the digital

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,240
equivalent of that was a mighty short

57
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,730
fire while you were wearing and in

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,450
blaming the victim we are focusing on

59
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,040
defending systems over identifying

60
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,070
pursuing and bringing to justice the

61
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,390
human behind the cybercrime

62
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,769
this defense focus strategy has been

63
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,059
with us for so long we've almost

64
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,610
forgotten where it's come from it's an

65
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,410
assumption that should underlies the

66
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:07,830
whole field of cybersecurity its

67
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:11,160
inherent in the name cybersecurity why

68
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,120
is that well nearly a decade ago when I

69
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,070
was serving on the House Armed Services

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,660
Committee I handled the cybersecurity

71
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,920
portfolio which I know may seem

72
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,710
surprising to you that I am NOT a

73
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,179
technical person but there was and my

74
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,560
job was to try and explain to members of

75
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,240
Congress what was going on and what the

76
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,670
government was doing in cybersecurity

77
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,580
then the Bush administration proposed

78
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,679
this thing called the comprehensive

79
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:34,440
national cybersecurity initiative which

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,300
was focused on creating a front line of

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,950
defense of cybersecurity but frankly was

82
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,540
really just to grab to try and put

83
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,339
endpoint detections on private sector

84
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,299
networks we were concerned about it we

85
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,260
scaled it back they focused then on

86
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,570
protecting government networks and

87
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,459
increasing education and outreach to

88
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,750
people on cybersecurity protecting

89
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,430
critical infrastructure things like that

90
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,170
but that's the NCI and its focus help

91
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:03,690
define the government cybersecurity

92
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:06,839
approach for decades to come but it

93
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,880
doesn't have to be that way if we think

94
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,600
of cybersecurity along two different

95
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,600
axes defense and offense system and

96
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,279
human the CNC I and most of our talk

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,980
about cybersecurity is in the quadrant

98
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,289
that it's in system and defense we talk

99
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,000
about how we secure systems we think

100
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,040
about patching we think about updating

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,950
we think about we think about supply

102
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,020
chain we think about secure codes we are

103
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:36,030
thinking about how do we secure the

104
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:40,380
system itself from the from the militia

105
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,119
factor a focus on system and defense

106
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,020
while necessary is by no means

107
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,000
sufficient

108
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:50,400
all right it's there are a whole bunch

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,260
of other places where where security can

110
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,900
fail so we also started thinking about

111
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,560
defense and human how do you make the

112
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,969
user a more savvy

113
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,950
operator year not to click on the link

114
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,030
stop using password is your password I'm

115
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,750
sure everyone's has somebody in their

116
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,919
office like this

117
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:11,220
I certainly do but if you're sick if

118
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,340
your security depends on humans to be

119
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,550
perfect a hundred percent of the time

120
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,469
it's designed to fail so then we started

121
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,480
thinking about system and offense right

122
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,910
this whole debate about hack back should

123
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,410
we go on to the attackers Network should

124
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,820
we deny them access to their tools

125
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:31,350
should we take down botnets I went to

126
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,020
law school just down the street the

127
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,970
lawyer in me says hey look I could

128
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,500
really never recommend to anyone that

129
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,120
they go on to a third parties network

130
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,580
and start taking offensive action the

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
liability risk just too great so like I

132
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,150
could never recommend that there are

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,330
people who engage in offensive

134
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:51,090
activities in in other places but even

135
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,370
then to engage in offensive activity to

136
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,590
be able to take down the domains that

137
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,920
the attacker uses still leaves the

138
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,469
attacker free and at liberty to think

139
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,730
about new tactics and to come back at

140
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,430
you again in ways that you weren't

141
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,610
anticipating they the human are still at

142
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,610
large

143
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:15,359
so what are we doing about this last

144
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:19,500
quadrant about human and offense what

145
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,520
are we doing to find locate and hold

146
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,550
accountable that human attacker because

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,700
let's be clear all the zero days in the

148
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:33,410
world don't matter unless a human being

149
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:36,810
exploits them for malicious activity

150
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:40,440
whose responsibility is it to go after

151
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,610
that human now look I spend a lot of

152
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,650
time on the intelligence community and

153
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,110
let me tell you all those guys up there

154
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,179
at Cyber Command and NSA in the military

155
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,650
they are really eager to think about

156
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,270
this question and they sit around

157
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,580
spending a lot of time thinking about

158
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,500
what is the big one what is the cyber

159
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,370
9/11 that will allow them to kick over

160
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,790
into the side

161
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,060
whar um but for most of the malicious

162
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,710
malicious activity that we see today

163
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,360
taking a militarized approach to dealing

164
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,690
with the human leaves you to some pretty

165
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,970
extreme places right like I just don't

166
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,070
think it's appropriate that the response

167
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,229
to someone setting up a fake Twitter

168
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,580
account or selling credit cards online

169
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,580
is to launch a drone strike

170
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,550
but since I've left the intelligence

171
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,530
community committee over a decade ago

172
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,440
the volume of cyber attacks have only

173
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,570
increased it's not just limited to

174
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,940
stealing intellectual property or

175
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,400
people's data um since then we've seen

176
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,320
people stealing millions of dollars out

177
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,659
of the Federal Reserve account in the

178
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,010
bank of Bangladesh we've seen major

179
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,930
International shipping companies

180
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,789
crippled dead in the water as a result

181
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,070
of ransomware attacks we've seen health

182
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:52,110
care systems unable to process patient

183
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,599
responses because their systems are

184
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,840
locked down we've seen essential

185
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,030
services in cities across this country

186
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,179
locked up by ransomware attacks and

187
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:06,090
we've seen in around the world attacks

188
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,639
on critical infrastructure interruptions

189
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,190
and power plants and power supply and

190
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,900
even the casinos are Sheldon Adelson

191
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,810
thank you very much you're wrong oh but

192
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,159
these are the attacks that make the news

193
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:22,710
the vast majority of attacks that we see

194
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,690
are not actually that big right you guys

195
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:28,680
have all everyone have these attacks of

196
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:31,560
like $1 on your iTunes account $5 $50

197
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,779
$500 $50,000 stolen out of people's bank

198
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,760
accounts those things don't even

199
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:40,919
register anymore right but why not one

200
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,830
check carding scam in the United States

201
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,870
netted more in a single day than every

202
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,690
in-person bank robbery in the United

203
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,450
States that year combined but where are

204
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,690
we putting our resources right we are

205
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,610
ignoring this

206
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,020
so while NSA and Cyber Command sit

207
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,580
around waiting for the big one we do

208
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,870
have federal agencies that are empowered

209
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,250
right now to do something about the

210
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,220
human attacker and the question is are

211
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,699
they right the FBI the Secret Service

212
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,230
San Francisco PD NYPD their organization

213
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:14,169
that have the ability and the authority

214
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,230
to begin investigations into these

215
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:18,970
cybercrime cases and be able to bring

216
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,209
indictments against people we've seen a

217
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,829
few of them but sadly in most law

218
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,349
enforcement jurisdictions if you try and

219
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,399
come in with we've heard this from

220
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,499
people who've tried to come in and

221
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:31,689
report their cyber crimes they're told

222
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:33,999
it didn't happen in our jurisdiction it

223
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:36,189
happened on the internet so we can't

224
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:37,509
take your complaint well I'm sorry if

225
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:39,009
someone could point me to the internet

226
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:40,559
police then I would be delighted to go

227
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:43,299
there and report the crime but like

228
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,069
crimes happen to people in geographic

229
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:48,579
jurisdictions we need to figure out how

230
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:50,229
to do this so but when we think about

231
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:52,089
this and we think about sort of the big

232
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,279
crimes or the little crimes how big a

233
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,850
volume are we crime are we asking law

234
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:01,359
enforcement to take on well we have a

235
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:04,419
massive undercount problem in 2018 the

236
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:07,899
FBI received nearly 350,000 reports of

237
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:10,179
cyber crimes seems like a lot and right

238
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:13,059
one incident can encompass many

239
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:15,069
different individuals but the FBI

240
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:18,039
estimates that they're under counters

241
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:21,189
off by a factor of 10 which mean you'd

242
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:25,119
have 3.5 million estimated estimate

243
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:26,829
incidents but what we found in looking

244
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:30,369
at numbers on this is that Gallup had

245
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:32,649
done a survey and asked people how has

246
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:34,989
your household been hit by a cyber crime

247
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:37,470
and they predominantly meant some kind

248
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:42,609
of financial fraud and what they found

249
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:44,859
was that nearly one in four households

250
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:47,619
have been hit by some kind of cybercrime

251
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:49,720
making it the most prevalent form of

252
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:52,959
crime in the United States which would

253
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,079
lead you to a total of going back nearly

254
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,439
thirty one and a half million cyber

255
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,878
crimes in the United States what that

256
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:03,279
means is we are in the middle of an

257
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:11,230
cyber crime wave and nobody is talking

258
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:12,339
about it but part of the problem is not

259
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,439
only are we in the middle of a hidden

260
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:18,730
crime wave but we have a hidden

261
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:20,409
enforcement crisis um look the data is

262
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,119
hard on this and I will admit it oh oh

263
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:22,700
animated I didn't think it was going to

264
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:26,480
do that

265
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:29,090
um one of my researchers went back and

266
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,320
he looked at all the data and it's

267
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,610
really hard because not everything is

268
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,960
reported and it's hard to match

269
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:39,520
incidents against government activity

270
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:43,340
but what he found was that for every

271
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:46,579
thousand reported incidents we only saw

272
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,860
an arrest in three of them so not only

273
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,250
is this the most prevalent form of crime

274
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:56,630
in America it is also the least enforced

275
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:59,450
crime in America but that's off of

276
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,300
reports of crimes that we know about as

277
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,730
I said the FBI's under count could be as

278
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,410
high as one in a hundred

279
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,050
they could be off by a factor of two

280
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,850
which means that it's not actually three

281
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,829
and a thousand it could be as high as

282
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,180
three and a hundred thousand and I'm

283
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:22,430
sorry if that's convinced some of you to

284
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:24,620
change career fields um now look we

285
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,540
think this is unacceptable we don't

286
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,330
think that digital criminals should be

287
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,040
able to operate with such impunity given

288
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:35,360
the state of analog law enforcement

289
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,260
today and we recognize that solving this

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,460
problem is hard we've heard from law

291
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,680
enforcement look there's no way to

292
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,140
figure out who these attackers are they

293
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,160
hide their identities they're operating

294
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,000
through encrypted services or

295
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,350
even if we figure out who they are

296
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,280
they're in a place where we can't get

297
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,170
access to them

298
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,370
right they're harbored in st. Petersburg

299
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,050
and we're not getting them turned over

300
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,380
to us we've heard about a lack of

301
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,660
trained law enforcement personnel and

302
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,070
and we've seen over and over again that

303
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,660
as soon as someone built up some

304
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,130
expertise in this area they're hired

305
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,780
away to the private sector to do

306
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,640
security for major corporations and

307
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,410
nearly three times their current their

308
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,500
government salary so it's really hard to

309
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,699
keep the expertise in-house we've heard

310
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,180
about a lack of resources for

311
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,440
attribution and a lack of technology a

312
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,930
lack of knowledge from law enforcement

313
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,790
about what data they can ask for and

314
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,290
what data is available to them from

315
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,240
companies as they investigate these

316
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,339
crimes and we've heard about the

317
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,810
challenges of geography right all too

318
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,640
often the victim and the perpetrator are

319
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,010
in different countries

320
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,870
a lot of law enforcement agencies are

321
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,209
just not that capable at helping

322
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,570
turnover or investigate cyber crimes

323
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:46,550
against people in their jurisdictions

324
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,550
but it's not impossible right there are

325
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:52,609
a few successes Alexei Birkhoff pled

326
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:56,689
guilty last week to check car to karting

327
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:59,180
scams and will could face up to 15 years

328
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,740
in jail he's not the only one some of

329
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,019
you may have read the Great Wall Street

330
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,450
Journal story about the couple who shut

331
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,160
down the security cameras in Washington

332
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,829
DC the surveillance cameras three days

333
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,870
before Trump's inauguration the FBI

334
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:14,359
found them because the guy used an email

335
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,740
address to on his Amazon account that

336
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,740
they were used to trace it he used it to

337
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,200
buy a literal smoking gun

338
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,760
so look some criminals are stupid and we

339
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,480
can catch them but also we need to be

340
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,180
better at at at investigating these

341
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,430
kinds of crimes and it's not impossible

342
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,500
um this is why over the past year we at

343
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,439
third wave set about to understand this

344
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,170
enforcement gap why it exists and how we

345
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,930
can close it in our first major report

346
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,279
to catch a hacker this is a screenshot

347
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:47,810
of the web page I have copies if you

348
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,579
want actual paper we laid out three

349
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,349
major policy areas where we think we

350
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:52,880
need more attention and focus in order

351
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:58,490
to make progress in closing the law

352
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,990
enforcement gap for domestic we need to

353
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,060
strengthen domestic law enforcement and

354
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,220
there we identify four areas we need to

355
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,959
rebalance resourcing in this area so

356
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,490
that law enforcement has the resources

357
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,640
that it needs to be able to actually

358
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,860
investigate these crimes no people have

359
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,510
said - and and look there's plenty of

360
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,329
money over on the military side I used

361
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,160
to do budgets like the FBI would choke

362
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:20,719
to death trying to absorb the amount of

363
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,130
money in the NSA's couch cushions

364
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,130
there's just a lot of money out there

365
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,329
second we need to build a cyber capable

366
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,740
law enforcement work force we need to

367
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,359
invest more in the training of law

368
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,910
enforcement so they know what to ask for

369
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,060
they know how the systems work law

370
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,170
enforcement officers they they can they

371
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,939
graduate from Quantico they know how to

372
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,620
take fingerprints but do they know how

373
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,540
to do a reverse whois lookup do they

374
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,770
even know where to begin collecting

375
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:50,069
after forensics and

376
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,839
in a cybercrime case we think that this

377
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,670
is an overlooked area that it's very

378
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,110
specialized in the FBI and not something

379
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,930
that they all need to know that they all

380
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:02,060
know about third we need better

381
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,010
attribution efforts the FBI and DOJ

382
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:07,109
cannot keep asking the technology

383
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,360
community for exceptional access to

384
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:12,720
encryption as a way of solving their

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,310
problems this is not the only thing that

386
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,910
stands in their way of investigating

387
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,619
this part there are other things that

388
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,020
they can be doing they don't even know

389
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,399
how to write a proper request so to a

390
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,140
lot of the technology companies to be

391
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,880
able to ask for the data they can give

392
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,140
they can get a lot of metadata they

393
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,130
don't know how to ask for it they don't

394
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,170
know how to use it they don't know how

395
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,000
to process it before they come and ask

396
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,920
us to weaken encryption for everyone

397
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,480
let's focus on the things the

398
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,479
low-hanging fruit that they can do

399
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,320
fourth we need a carrot and stick

400
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,520
approach to fugitives right there are a

401
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,760
lot of people who are outside the United

402
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:51,390
States we need to think about sanctions

403
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,600
the same kinds of tools that we used

404
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:56,760
against terrorist financing networks and

405
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,520
rewards we offered 15 million dollars

406
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,459
for the furrow sama bin Laden we can

407
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,400
offer money for the apprehension of

408
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:07,559
cyber criminals and we don't use that

409
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,850
tool nearly enough but even if we

410
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,040
improved all of our domestic law

411
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,260
enforcement agencies we'd still need to

412
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,119
make improvements in international

413
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,530
cooperation and diplomacy in order to

414
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,760
make this work because we don't have

415
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,859
agreement internationally about what

416
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,480
cybercrime looks like and how to

417
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,329
prosecute this and you see this playing

418
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,040
out in real time at the UN where Russia

419
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,319
and China are advancing a cyber crime a

420
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,290
new cybercrime treaty that does not

421
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,350
actually focus on cybercrime but could

422
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,928
really undermine internet freedoms and

423
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,300
allow them to prosecute more dissidents

424
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:40,650
around the world we need to think about

425
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,090
what we really mean when we're talking

426
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,650
about cybercrime and what the malicious

427
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,000
activity is and try and reach some

428
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,780
agreement about the things that really

429
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,790
harm people and we need a national

430
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,870
strategy and political leadership on

431
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,879
this issue because a lot of these

432
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:59,219
problems are interagency State

433
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,510
Department and FBI right FBI

434
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,550
NYPD we need to figure out how to

435
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,350
communicate across agencies and that

436
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,409
only happens if you have political

437
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,060
leadership at the top now I am NOT

438
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,130
optimistic that that political

439
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:15,190
leadership exists at the moment but I am

440
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,630
really hopeful than in a few months we

441
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,550
might have a change in that leadership

442
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,610
and someone who is able to actually

443
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,460
build and sustain a comprehensive plan

444
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:29,979
to address this problem

445
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:32,860
um look but mostly we have found that

446
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,920
the biggest obstacle to making progress

447
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,320
in this area is a sense of futility that

448
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,980
anything can be done to solve the

449
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,389
problem that all of these barriers

450
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,070
individually make people feel like well

451
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,200
you can't do this unless you solve that

452
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,760
and there's a real sense that like there

453
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,340
is nothing to be done and we are just

454
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,620
gonna have to live with the volume of

455
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,939
attacks that continue to hit us every

456
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:59,770
day maybe we can't solve all of it but

457
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,200
look no one saying crime is gonna go to

458
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:06,460
zero but there are many things that we

459
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,160
can do working together that make a

460
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,220
difference in small ways and in those

461
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,860
small ways add up to big change because

462
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,350
there's no reason why when someone is

463
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,679
the victim of a cyber crime that that

464
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:25,230
crime goes unpunished and they never see

465
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,230
justice with that thank you

466
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,180
[Applause]
