1
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:23,779
thank you so yes so I work on various

2
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:27,329
forms of abuse at Facebook and

3
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:30,200
previously at LinkedIn but I'm gonna

4
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:36,809
tell you a little secret which is that

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:38,550
sometimes I wish I worked on ads because

6
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,280
from my point of view as a security

7
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,790
person I see ads shown on the internet

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,519
like like these ones here and I think oh

9
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,690
please you know it's pretty easy to

10
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:51,629
measure what's going on

11
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,879
you show ads they get eyeballs people

12
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,190
click on them then advertisers give you

13
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,089
money and that's that's dollars that's

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,620
the impact so if I want to figure out

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,359
what to work on how to improve ad

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,590
ranking I look for the place to increase

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,350
the dollars the most and if I want to

18
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,810
know whether that worked I look at my

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,100
revenue statement and say you know did

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,179
the did the dollars go up and my friends

21
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,380
and ads tell me it's actually a little

22
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:21,360
more complicated than that because

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,630
there's stuff like user experience but

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,729
you know from from from my perch and

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:31,500
security it seems it seems the grass is

26
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:35,789
greener but I don't work on ads I work

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,549
on fighting abuse and these are just

28
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,200
some of the things that that we have to

29
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,280
tackle at Facebook and I'm sure many

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,049
many of you here also have to deal with

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,399
so things you know from account access

32
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,860
issues to click fraud scraping identity

33
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,720
theft and so on and you have all these

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,310
different things and how how the

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,079
question is how we figure out which one

36
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,880
to work on right how should we

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,110
prioritize these and furthermore once we

38
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,669
wants to make that decision and decide

39
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,649
to work on something then how do we know

40
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,760
whether we're doing well how do we

41
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:19,350
measure the impact so just as some

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,730
examples here's some you know some some

43
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,910
examples of things that we look at in

44
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,310
facebook so adults imagery is something

45
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,139
that we're trying to you know clamp down

46
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,900
on we've got your traditional

47
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:32,760
merchandise spam

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,470
and of course fishing and other forms of

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,060
scams and bad content so we really want

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,220
to know like you know what's going on

51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,890
out there but it turns out that

52
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,330
measuring abuse is difficult so and this

53
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,640
is so there's actually a very complex

54
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,340
problem and I'll touch on a number of

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,549
different fields you know that we've

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:02,280
drawn inspiration from in trying to deal

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:04,260
with this so one issue is that in in my

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,540
hypothetical as example everything was

59
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,950
measured in dollars in abuse we

60
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,160
everything is in a different unit I

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,820
don't know how much a spam post is worth

62
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,480
versus an account compromised versus an

63
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,480
identity theft

64
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,660
we furthermore we don't necessarily know

65
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
what's out there right some attacks

66
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,920
tickets by surprise the adversary is

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,119
always trying to get around our defenses

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,399
so we can't use standard machine

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,020
learning techniques because those assume

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,630
that your data is kind of unchanging

71
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,980
most things on your site are good so is

72
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,540
use could have the kind of needle in a

73
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,869
haystack problem especially as you get

74
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:49,579
to some of the more more so kind of high

75
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,500
impact low prevalence categories and

76
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,780
finally there's this problem of what is

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,030
ground truth what is bad anyway and I

78
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,370
have a picture here of former Supreme

79
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,710
Court justice Potter Stewart who in a

80
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,240
famous case selling pornography said I

81
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:08,310
don't know what it is but I know it when

82
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:10,200
I see it and we want we want to avoid

83
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,480
falling into that trap we don't want

84
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,910
everyone who is kind of in charge of

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,469
deciding to know it when they see it we

86
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,940
want we want some kind of standard for

87
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:23,640
ground truth of what is allowed and

88
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:25,680
what's not so we're gonna kind of take

89
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,280
you through kind of the process of how

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,650
we build up measurement and it starts in

91
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,690
in what I call the dark ages where

92
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,900
basically that your prayer your

93
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:43,320
prioritization function is who can yell

94
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:45,150
the loudest and so you know that Bell

95
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,380
if your if your CEO is telling you to

96
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,080
work on something you're gonna work on

97
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,390
it and you know if some engineer finds a

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:56,880
little problem you know might not get as

99
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,740
high priority and the impact is

100
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:05,159
typically measured in how much stuff did

101
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:07,490
we block and I'll say in a minute why is

102
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:14,600
it not even not a great metric but

103
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:16,500
basically we're kind of blind here so

104
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,510
kind of the difference between the Dark

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,270
Ages and the Renaissance in history was

106
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,789
kind of the advent of science so if we

107
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,430
want to apply science to our problem we

108
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,650
could start to measure stuff so for a

109
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,130
prioritization we want to do something

110
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,450
like for each problem figure out how

111
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,680
much of it there is what's the volume

112
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:40,710
and classify the different problems

113
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,200
according to their harm level so in this

114
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,539
example maybe spam is yellow account

115
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,800
takeovers orange and I know theft is the

116
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,700
worst one that's it that's a level red

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,550
and we don't have necessarily a

118
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,469
scientific way to assign numerical

119
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,240
values to these harm levels but at least

120
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,860
we can we can qualitatively bucket them

121
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,570
and and you know estimate the trade-offs

122
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,510
and then to figure out your priorities

123
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:09,000
you multiply volume times harm and that

124
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:12,210
should give you some kind of number that

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,770
will allow you to at least rank the

126
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,539
problems in in order of importance and

127
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,680
then you can go through and assign

128
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:23,000
resources so once you work on something

129
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,290
how do you figure out what to do and

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,030
what I would argue here is that the

131
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,410
amount of stuff that you block is not

132
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:33,719
what matters it's the amount of stuff

133
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:35,340
you don't block because the amount of

134
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,770
stuff you block is what they use what

135
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,630
people aren't seeing and the stuff you

136
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,549
don't block is what's actually affecting

137
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,550
your users your false positives and your

138
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,100
false negatives and you can see these

139
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,050
these you know may be related maybe not

140
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,480
at the beginning of this graph you can

141
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,830
see kind of the orange

142
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,210
jumps up and the blue goes down so maybe

143
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,020
we started blocking a bunch of stuff

144
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,780
that we were previously catching

145
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,870
not blocking sorry but towards the end

146
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,539
you see the blue is fairly constant and

147
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,500
the orange is going down maybe that

148
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:12,310
means the attacker gave up and so the

149
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,470
orange going down is is a good thing in

150
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,639
this case because we you know it's one

151
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,639
less thing to worry about

152
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,659
so to do both of these things we need

153
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,909
some kind of measurement so in addition

154
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:27,789
to you know avoiding the prioritization

155
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:29,590
function of yelling measurement allows

156
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,240
you to track your progress over time and

157
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,508
figure out where you're you know where

158
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,710
you're going backwards if you get enough

159
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,500
you know quality measurement you can

160
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:41,020
train machine learning models using this

161
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,909
data if you have enough coverage you can

162
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,830
do deep dives into what are what are we

163
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:46,630
missing where are we going wrong what

164
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,840
are what are the trends what is this

165
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,389
exam you know what are the examples and

166
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,619
if you have kind of if your measurement

167
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,710
is delayed you can at least take down

168
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,590
some stuff retro actively provided that

169
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:03,698
you don't mess up your measurement and

170
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,590
I'll go into that in a little bit so

171
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:07,860
basically in this in this transition

172
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,750
from the dark ages to the Renaissance

173
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,860
from from kind of yelling and guessing

174
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,569
to using science there's we need a piece

175
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,789
of technology to enable this transition

176
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:21,759
and for for the you know cultural

177
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,830
Renaissance in you know the 1500s or so

178
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,430
this piece of economic technology was

179
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,740
the printing press it allowed knowledge

180
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:34,060
to be transferred you know broadly to

181
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,339
too many people and for measuring abuse

182
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,250
this piece of technology is labeling so

183
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:42,459
it's being able to identify which things

184
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:46,510
are bad or look at all your content and

185
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:49,719
decide which is good and which is bad so

186
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,660
now I want to talk about you dive into

187
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,520
labeling and talk about how we actually

188
00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:00,430
label abuse and the first approach which

189
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,050
is it will be the one that I you know

190
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,479
that I that I led with in the dark ages

191
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,899
we just count what you blocked you know

192
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,940
if you blocked it it's bad right even

193
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,620
assuming even ignoring false positive

194
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,920
right maybe I blocked it as a bunch of

195
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,060
false positives that so it doesn't count

196
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,479
even though even assuming these are true

197
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,099
positives having a spike in this graph

198
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,500
doesn't tell me anything I don't know

199
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,480
whether I should you know ring the alarm

200
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,510
call it my you know reserved incident

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,670
responders and and and deal with this or

202
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,140
if this is just business as usual and

203
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,260
there was a new attack the system

204
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,760
blocked it I can I can go on without

205
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,810
knowing what we didn't block this is

206
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,760
this is impossible the other problem is

207
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,770
I mean so that's one problem another

208
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,810
problem is that looking at the past

209
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,540
means you can't find new attacks you

210
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,790
only see what you've already blocked and

211
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,050
this is really a bad idea if you're

212
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,520
trying to train machine learning models

213
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,199
because it's creates feedback loops that

214
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:02,350
can that can really throw things out of

215
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:05,350
whack so the next approach is to have

216
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,760
your users do the labeling right so this

217
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,790
is this is a standard feature in many

218
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,080
large scale products on Facebook you you

219
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,650
know if there's a post you click the

220
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,120
dots there's a choice to give feedback

221
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:20,170
and then within the feedback you can say

222
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,090
this is spam harassment violence etc and

223
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,280
this gets you a lot of data alright

224
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,080
people like to report stuff you probably

225
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,790
all click spam and you're on your email

226
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,900
sometime which is another similar

227
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,069
reporting flow and this is this goes

228
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,390
good this can show is a directional

229
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,490
measure right if there were number of

230
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,620
reports doubles probably some things

231
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,720
going on or maybe you launched a new

232
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,860
product but you know let's leave that

233
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,150
aside and reports can also surface

234
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,590
things that the users care about that

235
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,209
maybe your systems are missing right

236
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:51,210
they close some of your blind spots

237
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,980
however user reporting is wildly

238
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,760
inconsistent so in some previous

239
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,900
research I've done we found that for a

240
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:07,780
certain category of reporting fake

241
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:12,600
accounts on LinkedIn the precision of

242
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:15,010
reporters with something like 35% our

243
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,230
reporting flows on Facebook we also we

244
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,569
also see you know poor poor precision

245
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,610
according to our definitions and the

246
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,450
reason for that is our definitions are

247
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,340
not the

248
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,200
definitions right if you click spam on

249
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,670
your email typically it's just something

250
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,010
you didn't want to see some promotion

251
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,420
maybe even a receipt you know someone

252
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,380
else signed you up for a service

253
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:37,900
accidentally and it's not necessarily

254
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,100
spam is in defined by the policy is

255
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:44,500
something that needs to be taken down

256
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:46,900
from the service in addition reports can

257
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,610
also be gamed so suppose that I you know

258
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,290
put in a policy that said ok any piece

259
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,400
of content that gets reported 10 times

260
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,839
gets taken down

261
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,370
well then certain unethical you know

262
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,260
parties might decide oh that my

263
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,240
competitors posting I'm gonna get all my

264
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,790
friends to report their spam report them

265
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,800
as spam and get their content taken down

266
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,300
so there's an adversarial aspect here

267
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,490
which means you can't can't always rely

268
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:15,640
on reporting data an approach that works

269
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,250
much better and is is really considered

270
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,220
the gold standard within Facebook is is

271
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:27,040
human labeling find some get some

272
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:29,050
experts to decide and I guess this this

273
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,400
is the what the problem here is solving

274
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,439
the I know it when I see it problem

275
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,449
right so getting everybody to agree on

276
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,980
what is the actual policy so the way we

277
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,430
do this is to create some kind of rubric

278
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,350
so have the experts you know go through

279
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,819
and create a system a systematic rubric

280
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,170
of things to look at and decisions to

281
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,110
make that can allow you to assess

282
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:56,500
whether a content or account or activity

283
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:59,350
is a legitimate or malicious then sample

284
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:03,010
out of all your activity and send it to

285
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,510
your trained labelers who can you know

286
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:09,850
apply the rubric and and get you

287
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,290
measurement now there's the problem than

288
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,640
most things on your site are good so

289
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:17,020
this is this category imbalance that i

290
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,880
talked about earlier and so if if say

291
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,010
you know 99 percent of things are good

292
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,760
and i send you know send random samples

293
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:26,500
to labelers they might not even notice

294
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,540
when when the one bad thing out of 100

295
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:33,160
shows up i mean this this phenomenon of

296
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,189
labor fatigue has has been

297
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,189
well-documented

298
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:41,240
and you also get large error bars if

299
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:44,100
you're sending you know very few samples

300
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,100
so we solve this using stratified

301
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,050
sampling so we can use heuristics or

302
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,930
some other classifiers to over sample

303
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,270
suspicious activity and this will

304
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:57,780
address problems of labour fatigue and

305
00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:00,689
also I get you improved statistical

306
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:03,329
estimates and so this approach is

307
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,820
deployed at Facebook on a number of

308
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:12,000
problems some of which are reported in

309
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:14,670
our transparency report and so we've

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,270
week we can define rubrics and measure

311
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,579
these types of issues and we can do the

312
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:23,250
analysis and get nice plots of over time

313
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,830
how is it changing what are the error

314
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,050
bars and then based on this we can look

315
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,760
into trends and you can say why did it

316
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,939
spike you know why did it spam

317
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,920
consumption spike on day six or what is

318
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,740
what is the examples that are driving

319
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,599
this and you can actually do similar

320
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,400
this is these are for false negatives

321
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,960
like bad things that show up you can do

322
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,640
the same thing for false positives you

323
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:50,330
know real users that you that you

324
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:54,510
blocked or benign users that you blocked

325
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:56,550
but this doesn't work for everything so

326
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,860
you need the standardized rubrics you

327
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,569
need infrastructure to handle all these

328
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,770
content queuing and farming things out

329
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:06,960
delay blurs and if I have a fake like on

330
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,069
Facebook or I guess a like on Facebook

331
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,680
and I want to figure out whether it's

332
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,180
fake you know I can't I can't

333
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,800
necessarily send that to a reviewer and

334
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,390
say here's a like tell me whether it was

335
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,819
malicious right it's easy to do with

336
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:22,280
it's easier to do with fishing I you

337
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:25,200
look at the text you look at the URL etc

338
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,020
so the human labeling doesn't doesn't

339
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,650
work for all problems so we've done is

340
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,540
is used some automated labeling so the

341
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,150
key idea kind of from up from a

342
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,439
technical point of view is use some kind

343
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:42,870
of clustering to group things together

344
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,490
compute cluster level statistics to say

345
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,320
like okay here's some properties of this

346
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,500
cluster or maybe embed this clustering

347
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,120
vector space as a point and then do

348
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,610
anomaly detection to find the outliers

349
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,340
and these tend to be the examples that

350
00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:01,280
are scripted for example if I have a

351
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:04,080
cluster of custom if I have one user

352
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,360
who's doing a bunch of likes but hasn't

353
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,220
sent any friend requests you know maybe

354
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,690
that's you know that's just what that

355
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:16,080
user chose to do but if I have thousands

356
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,430
of users who all are liking and no one

357
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,320
are none of them are making any friend

358
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:21,300
requests then that's highly suspicious

359
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,730
that would be considered an anomaly that

360
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:30,240
we could use in our labeling so the

361
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:32,040
automated detection is deployed on a

362
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,310
number of problems at Facebook and and

363
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:43,860
use to track internal direction set

364
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:45,810
goals and prioritize so I just want to

365
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,010
go back and then and compare all these

366
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,530
different approaches so I talked about

367
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,090
four different approaches and these are

368
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:55,290
some dimensions that we care about when

369
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,880
when building a measurement system so we

370
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,640
really want we want coverage right we

371
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,140
want to capture all the false negatives

372
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,880
we want to be forward-looking we're able

373
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,970
to take action based on this rather than

374
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,010
just look at the past we want to avoid

375
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,760
feedback loops so that when we act on it

376
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,869
we don't ruin our measurement we want to

377
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,069
be resistant to ever say that

378
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,629
manipulation right we don't want the

379
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,069
adversary to be able to game our

380
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,949
measurement because then we can't tell

381
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:23,879
whether they actually went away or they

382
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:26,699
just avoided our measurement we want to

383
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,470
be able to use this to inform detection

384
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,630
be able to look at the look at examples

385
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,900
take deep dives and we want to scale it

386
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,940
to new problems right so if I build up a

387
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,390
measurement system for spam I want to be

388
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:44,460
able to scale it also to fake likes for

389
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,810
example so counting blocks really

390
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,100
doesn't satisfy any of these except of

391
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,810
course it's easy to scale cuz you can

392
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:56,480
count you can couch pretty much anything

393
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:59,450
user reporting as we saw is is biased

394
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,640
and can be manipulated but

395
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,280
is independent from the measurement

396
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,300
right because it's it's from our users

397
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,950
it can scale if I mean the back and will

398
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,110
scale but you need to do UI work for

399
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,380
every new problem you need to put

400
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:17,959
reporting on and depending on the scale

401
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:22,010
you can get and the precision you may be

402
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,690
able to use it to inform detection human

403
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,720
labeling we have we have better luck

404
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,910
with and really the only the problem

405
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,670
here is whether or not you can get

406
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,670
enough samples to know that you have a

407
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:38,630
representative view of all the abuse

408
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:40,580
that's going on on the platform and the

409
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,500
real drawback is in scaling in that if I

410
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,270
want to spin up a new set of human label

411
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,430
oars I have to do do it all over again

412
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,290
there's no there's no way to scale it

413
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:53,570
anything else then make a new rubric

414
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:54,980
train up a bunch more people automated

415
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,860
labeling checks a different set of boxes

416
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,420
so so it may not capture all false

417
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,389
negatives depending on the algorithm you

418
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,100
use and also depending on the signals

419
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,690
you use and they may or may not be

420
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,010
resistant to ever Sarah man if you a

421
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:13,850
ssin but it does scale and it does avoid

422
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:16,550
feedback loops and kind of the key

423
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:20,090
takeaway here is that the successful

424
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,409
approaches amplify expert opinion right

425
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,159
so the user reporting is kind of the

426
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,990
opinion of non experts and a human

427
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,720
labeling takes some experts there write

428
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,800
a rubric and scale that out to laborers

429
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,530
automated labeling we take some experts

430
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,260
they tune anomaly detection system and

431
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:42,470
we can scale that out to all different

432
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:45,650
problems but labeling is actually only

433
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,760
the first step so we want to turn we

434
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,490
have labeling and we want to turn that

435
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,629
into into measurement somehow and here's

436
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,270
where we run into something called good

437
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,490
hearts law so Charles Goodhart is a

438
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,620
professor user was a professor at the

439
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,750
London School of Economics

440
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,610
and he coined the observation that when

441
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,880
when a measure becomes a target it

442
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,469
ceases to be a good measure so let me

443
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,710
give an example this is kind of a

444
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:12,140
hypothetical example suppose that I for

445
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,159
my metric I decide that there's some

446
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,590
product

447
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:17,179
and if a user posts content more than a

448
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,970
hundred times an hour they're not using

449
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,190
the product rectly and they're bad so I

450
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,649
can just count how many people post more

451
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,090
than hundred times an hour and then like

452
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:28,488
aha I want to solve the problem I

453
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:32,359
launched a rate limit of 100 posts per

454
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:37,099
hour and my metric went to zero I solved

455
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,749
the problem done go home so obviously

456
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:40,729
that's not the case but this is kind of

457
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:43,519
an extreme example to illustrate what

458
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:48,679
can go wrong when you when you take your

459
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:51,830
when you enforce on your metric kind of

460
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,450
taking a little bit higher level isn't

461
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:55,099
that exactly a mathematical proof but an

462
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,259
illustration of kind of a little more

463
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:59,779
abstractly what's going wrong so we can

464
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:01,639
think of like the absolute ground truth

465
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:04,460
is some vector in a vector space like

466
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:06,168
here's you know here's the actual state

467
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,830
of the world known only to God for

468
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:13,999
example you know and we we mortal humans

469
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:16,249
have to have to create some metric and

470
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:17,989
you know this is some this is some

471
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:20,720
dimension on which the ground truth is

472
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:21,200
projected and then there's an orthogonal

473
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,779
dimension

474
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,369
that's the unmeasurable part kind of by

475
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:29,419
definition so basically the ground truth

476
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:32,988
is sum the vector sum of the part we can

477
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:34,999
measure and the part we can't measure so

478
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:39,259
what happens when we when we go on the

479
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:40,909
metric and try to move it down well so

480
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:44,029
if we're successful the metric dimension

481
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:46,369
moves down but the unmeasurable

482
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,840
dimension may be moved up may be move

483
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:49,970
down may be did nothing we really have

484
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,259
no control over it but basically if we

485
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,679
were successful at moving the metric

486
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:58,729
down a larger component of the ground

487
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,950
truth is now in the unmeasurable part so

488
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:03,429
we we know less about the problem than

489
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:07,429
we did before

490
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:09,889
and so the corollary that kind of I'd

491
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:13,519
like to introduce here is what I call

492
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:16,340
the abuse uncertainty principle which is

493
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:20,529
if you have a signal you can use it for

494
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:25,099
measurement or enforcement but not both

495
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:26,940
because if you use it for both then you

496
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:31,740
essentially don't know

497
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,840
has happened and so applying the

498
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,270
uncertainty principle at Facebook we

499
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,500
kind of we take a free take any signal

500
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,060
and we have to have some kind of

501
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,420
principles as to whether we should use

502
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:44,250
it for measurement or enforcement and

503
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,320
the principle that we use is if it's

504
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:50,580
something that's sort of client

505
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,790
controlled or easily changed and doesn't

506
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,879
actually solve the problem to change it

507
00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:00,570
then we use that for measurement so for

508
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,340
example if you were so I mean we look at

509
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,530
network properties or you know perhaps

510
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,649
properties of the request or even

511
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:10,860
user-generated content and for

512
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,420
enforcement we use things that maybe

513
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,860
maybe they're easy to figure out maybe

514
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,910
they're not but even if you figure them

515
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,469
out

516
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,300
we've changed your behavior we made it

517
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,950
more difficult to carry out the abuse so

518
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,870
the rate-limiting falls into that

519
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,330
category it's easy to stay below the

520
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:27,030
rate limit but at least once you've

521
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:31,830
imposed the rate limit you've moved some

522
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:33,780
part towards solving the problem and I

523
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,399
want to note on user-generated content I

524
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,750
mean so certainly for some for some

525
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,550
categories you want image recognition

526
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,590
you want to say like this is this is a

527
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,020
bad you know this this type of content

528
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,510
is not allowed but for kind of generic

529
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,660
abusive behavior you know compromised or

530
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,710
fake accounts you don't necessary to

531
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,490
generate content because it's

532
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:56,100
adversarially controlled and we've

533
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,620
actually seen users obfuscating their

534
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,030
spammy posts to the point where it

535
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,320
almost looked like a CAPTCHA that we

536
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,600
were going to have to solve to do the

537
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:11,399
detection so we don't we don't want to

538
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:13,560
do that so other things that we do so

539
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,320
iterate constantly right it's basically

540
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:19,080
so you build v1 of your metric you work

541
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,600
on enforcement driving it down and while

542
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,370
you're doing that you build v2 and that

543
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,459
catches some of this unmeasurable part

544
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,530
that you know and kind of this is this

545
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,310
is a stack instead of the vector sum but

546
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:34,860
it's the same thing right so v2 has it

547
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,600
has a new measurement that you know cuts

548
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,000
into some of the unmeasurable part of v1

549
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,540
we drive that down while building v3 and

550
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,250
and so on

551
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,320
we also want to use similar one use the

552
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,240
metrics as directional rather than as

553
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,520
absolute truth right I know there's a

554
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,970
part that's not measurable so I'm not

555
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,379
gonna report externally that you know if

556
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:00,120
I can't be very precise that you know

557
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:03,600
so-and-so's you know such a such problem

558
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:07,199
has exactly this number of examples on

559
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,850
Facebook and even internally I wouldn't

560
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,080
I wouldn't want to make that claim if I

561
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,350
knew that there was some part of the

562
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,310
problem that we were missing and then

563
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,360
you also have to validate the

564
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,909
measurement right measure the

565
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,649
measurement one way to do this is

566
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,110
through user reporting if you can

567
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,160
properly clean it another way we've done

568
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:28,139
some work on this son

569
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:34,260
an Instagram side we can actually look

570
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:35,910
at the black market and buy traffic by

571
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,820
illegitimate traffic there's that we've

572
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:45,870
have a research paper on buying like

573
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:47,610
fake likes and comments and use this to

574
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:52,770
see if our measurement is is catching

575
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:54,629
what's going on so due to this work

576
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,330
which is you know building on the work

577
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:01,050
of many dozens if not hundreds of people

578
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:04,530
within Facebook I don't wish I worked on

579
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:07,050
ads anymore so I know how to use

580
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,910
labeling to build measurement I know how

581
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,570
to use measurement to prioritize my work

582
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,980
and determine the impact of what I do

583
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,770
there's still this problem though that

584
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,150
everything is in different units and I

585
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,950
want to leave this kind of as a as a

586
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:23,640
challenge which is to build some kind of

587
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:25,680
universal adapter that will get me it

588
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,730
will allow many compare fake accounts

589
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:32,070
and phishing and spam and you know

590
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,260
identity theft and all these things as

591
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:35,850
well as to compare false negatives and

592
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,500
false positives so I can decide which

593
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:44,250
one I need to work on so just leave you

594
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:46,650
with a few questions so one is how do we

595
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,290
obtain a truly reliable signal from news

596
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,230
reporting i we know we've multiple

597
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,300
examples of users being very imprecise

598
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,430
and i talked about reporting humanely

599
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:59,070
building automated labeling is there

600
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:02,490
some kind of unified system that can

601
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:03,770
combine all these and get us even closer

602
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,540
to our goal

603
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:09,089
thank you

604
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,089
