1
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:22,810
so I'm really excited to be here at

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,340
enigma as a social scientist because so

3
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:28,270
many of you and your presentations

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:31,540
referred back to human values in data so

5
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:34,149
let's talk about culture and there's no

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,000
better vantage point than the global

7
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:39,850
cultural phenomenon that is tik-tok so

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,890
this is a Chinese app that tops all of

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,380
the lists of downloads and engagement

10
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,630
it's one of the most downloaded apps in

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,540
over 40 countries and you can see here

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:52,750
that it's 15-second skits of lip-syncing

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,269
dancing tutorials and it has a very

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:58,210
young highly engaged audience you know

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:02,740
there's more young teenagers on tik-tok

16
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:05,079
in the US than on Facebook so why are

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,720
our legislators calling it a potential

18
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:09,429
counterintelligence threat the US

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,220
government has opened a national

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,110
security review in to the acquisition of

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,869
the American company that became tik-tok

22
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:20,020
the Army and Marines have restricted its

23
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:22,030
use the app has 200 million users in

24
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,490
India where was banned for a short time

25
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,030
last year so what is all this

26
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:31,089
controversy about and the answer is data

27
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,790
now data's been called the new oil or

28
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,190
the jugular of the world economy but we

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:39,250
are programmed to see it differently in

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,729
the EU it's about protection of the

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:45,549
person behind that data in the u.s. it's

32
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:48,490
about liability unintended consequences

33
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:50,979
of acting on that data in India it's a

34
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:53,440
public policy tool in China and national

35
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:56,229
security tool and in Russia it's about

36
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,320
the ideology behind the data so there

37
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:02,700
are human values at the core of all of

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,649
these frameworks and as data becomes

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,590
tightly integrated in every aspect of

40
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:12,939
our lives data science is moving closer

41
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:15,010
to social science and this is critical

42
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:20,349
in today's world and I am going to show

43
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:22,720
you why now we also have risk as our

44
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,548
data is transferred in between these

45
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,310
different nation-state contexts with

46
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:29,470
different cultural frameworks so I'm

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,380
going to go into the cultural de Mer

48
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,300
behind these frameworks and look at the

49
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,920
cultural elements in privacy and

50
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,490
security and then we'll go to some case

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,679
studies and a call to action so culture

52
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,290
is that level of human programming in

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,320
between what's universal to all of us or

54
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:50,079
human nature and what is individual to

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,019
us our personality it's a set of shared

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,120
norms and beliefs and practices and we

57
00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:00,280
all belong to many cultural groups

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,720
ethnic religious gender Geographic now

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,870
you hear a probably B group really

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,720
excited to be at enigma with your people

61
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,730
speaking the same language right because

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,580
we as humans don't cooperate mindlessly

63
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,459
we specialize in our roles and it's that

64
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,270
culture that helps the group thrive and

65
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,690
succeed in its environment so I'm a

66
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,950
cultural specialist and this idea of

67
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,020
cross-cultural communication or cultural

68
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,780
intelligence is not a newfangled

69
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,750
business concept since the fourth

70
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,820
century BC philosophers have been asking

71
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,480
how shall I talk of the sea to the Frog

72
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:40,630
if it's never left its pond so I've

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,810
lived worked studied in nine different

74
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,489
countries nine different ponds

75
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,890
developing emerging markets for consumer

76
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:50,350
products companies and banks and I'm

77
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,260
also a linguist and language is how we

78
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,930
navigate the world this is critical

79
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,690
today in a post digital era where our

80
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:03,610
digital spaces are our spaces and

81
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,290
cybersecurity is security so culture is

82
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,280
a collective programming of the mind

83
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,530
what we see as beautiful or visionary or

84
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,630
intelligent depends on our cultural

85
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,450
framework and it's not just what we see

86
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,760
it's how we apologize across cultures in

87
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:22,659
a data breach or what information we

88
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,700
deem to be private in our culture so

89
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,460
anthropologists say that we all face the

90
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,289
same universal problems or tasks but

91
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,450
it's the approach that each group takes

92
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,120
that becomes the dimensions through

93
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,010
which we filter that experience so there

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,070
are hundreds of cultural dimensions

95
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:42,360
let's look at just one which is the idea

96
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,400
of individualism or collectivism

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,650
so the u.s. is the most individualistic

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,919
country in the world from very early on

99
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,000
we raise our kids to believe in

100
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,639
individual achievement and personal

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,620
recognition this is where we get our CEO

102
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,500
culture and our entrepreneurial spirit

103
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,560
but most of the world operates under

104
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,110
collectivist values of long term trust

105
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:08,009
and relationships and of shared goals

106
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:11,189
and priorities so when we navigate the

107
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:14,879
web or process data or frame our

108
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:17,669
policies we do this through these

109
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,919
cultural frameworks individualist will

110
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,539
seek information independently from

111
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,340
objective third-party sources

112
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,550
versus relying on their groups or

113
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,739
influencers and we in the u.s. have task

114
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,270
based relationships kind of disposable

115
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,520
around the task at hand

116
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,389
be it a product or a project or a

117
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,169
conference versus longer term

118
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:39,900
generational or trust-based

119
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,659
relationships and we take a monochronic

120
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,029
approach to time so very clear deadlines

121
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:48,060
and milestones it's almost like time is

122
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:51,960
a litmus test for responsibilities in

123
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,199
our culture and my class go crazy for

124
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,388
missed deadlines and late arrivals to

125
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,680
meetings and other cultures we need to

126
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,379
step back and think many of these

127
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,960
collectivist cultures have a longer view

128
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:05,849
of time then than we have in the US

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,888
history so a lot of time behinds a lot

130
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:11,009
of time in fronts it's not necessarily

131
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:13,409
an expiring resource so think of it as

132
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:16,620
like a balloon that inflates or deflates

133
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:18,509
according to the topic necessary so it's

134
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,349
actually a more sophisticated view of

135
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:24,719
time or of an agile approach so if

136
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:27,360
culture is how we frame our interaction

137
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:30,000
in our understanding the language is how

138
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,000
we process it and language is a soft

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,029
power in the digital world so if you

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,069
look at this chart this is Wikipedia

141
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:40,580
translations between languages you see

142
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:44,039
English they're firmly at the center

143
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,900
framing ideas and biases as that

144
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:49,080
information flows through people

145
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,179
speaking English so this is why China

146
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,389
through Baidu has its own collaborative

147
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,430
encyclopedia and Russia has announced an

148
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,130
investment

149
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:02,900
in a Russian week up Wikipedia to avoid

150
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:05,330
the Western biases of Wikipedia so this

151
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,000
is essentially a rejection of the

152
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,190
Western colonization of the digital

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,449
space and we'll take a look at that in

154
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:17,509
our case studies so if the original idea

155
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:20,630
of the Internet was this utopian view of

156
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:21,919
sharing information across cultures when

157
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,650
it came to the privacy and security

158
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,740
behind that data things started to get a

159
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,940
little bit more complicated so cyber

160
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:34,970
security is global by Nature but we're

161
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,340
using domestic security measures to

162
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,979
tackle global problems and looking at

163
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,729
these problems through national lenses

164
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:46,940
with domestic legal tools and as

165
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,909
transnational interactions become the

166
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,099
new normal it's hard to pinpoint what is

167
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,669
that contextual legal environment who

168
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:59,539
has jurisdiction and how the idea of

169
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:01,880
privacy is a cultural construct it's not

170
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:05,180
a deep primal need like human connection

171
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,580
and it's a young value so the first

172
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,099
definition in 1813 and case law only

173
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:14,840
started to emerge around ideas of

174
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:16,639
privacy in the early 1900s and if we

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,500
look about how much we're talking about

176
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,539
privacy we're only starting to really

177
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,320
wrap our minds around this when we saw

178
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:26,210
Microsoft's timeline of explicit privacy

179
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,550
initiatives the timeline started in the

180
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,650
year 2000 and here we can see across

181
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,529
languages whether it's English German

182
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:37,159
Spanish that we only started to talk

183
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:39,770
about privacy in the middle last century

184
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,830
and this is relevant because theories of

185
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,449
linguistic relativity inform that our

186
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,150
perception of the world is shaped

187
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,400
through the language we have and vice

188
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,860
versa so if we're not talking about it

189
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,350
we're not developing ideas around it and

190
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,650
the ideas are very different so in the

191
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,740
EU privacy is tied back to the dignity

192
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:03,380
of the person privacy is a fundamental

193
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,560
right in the EU charter countries like

194
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,450
Germany have a historical cultural

195
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,160
affinity for privacy

196
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,800
very different than say China or Russia

197
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,949
where privacy is literally a foreign

198
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,660
concept in Japan it's about

199
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,970
accountability and transparency not

200
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,949
about regulation and in u.s. it's

201
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,900
industry-specific what is the purpose of

202
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,050
that data and that privacy like HIPAA

203
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,959
and in China privacy is secondary to the

204
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,910
collective values of the state then we

205
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,430
usually frame privacy from an

206
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,250
individualistic perspective but remember

207
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:40,599
those collectivist cultures they take a

208
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:44,660
shared view towards the idea of privacy

209
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,390
so they negotiate privacy as a group now

210
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,310
a Boca dear and I'd are in their study

211
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,680
of social media used in the midle social

212
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,599
media use in the Middle East

213
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,880
demonstrated how Arabs don't see their

214
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,200
online personalities as reflecting

215
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,970
themselves as an individual but as part

216
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,850
of the larger familiar groups to which

217
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,310
they belong and when they took a look at

218
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,830
discussions on Twitter of privacy in

219
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:12,829
Arabic most often these translated back

220
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,630
to honor so the idea of honor is an

221
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,730
entrenched cultural value in

222
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:20,300
collectivist societies especially Arab

223
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:24,020
cultures and the idea of honor is really

224
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:26,050
a group dynamic not an individual one we

225
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,460
see this across all languages to the

226
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,920
nuances of how we translate this can be

227
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,050
different so if you ask a bilingual

228
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,880
Russian how they would translate privacy

229
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,130
they may struggle a bit because there

230
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,160
never really was much privacy in Russia

231
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,780
it's not part of the vernacular and we

232
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,040
see this in Chinese and across other

233
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:48,500
languages so even what we determined to

234
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,290
be private to us it depends on our

235
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,500
culture so is your home address private

236
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:57,410
information 82% of people in Poland say

237
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,780
yes it is but only is 32 percent of

238
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,990
people in Finland and we see similar

239
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,970
discrepancies across even the EU on

240
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,510
financial information your mobile phone

241
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,850
number search history so if we don't

242
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:14,330
have a universal understanding of what

243
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,940
is private how can we expect a global

244
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:21,080
GDP our or universal privacy and

245
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,750
security regulations so now let's take a

246
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,660
look at some taste

247
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:30,529
so as technology and globalization have

248
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:33,709
leveled borders nations are reinstating

249
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:36,350
these borders through tools for digital

250
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:38,930
sovereignty and many of these are

251
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:43,730
complicit with data digital colonialism

252
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:48,170
and digital authoritarianism so why is

253
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:51,380
5g a geopolitical issue China's military

254
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:55,510
academy talks about a military struggle

255
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:58,130
in the cyber domain the u.s. fears that

256
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,110
Huawei equipment can be used by the

257
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,120
Chinese government to spy on American

258
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,810
networks so the u.s. put together an

259
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,089
entity list China responded with the

260
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,119
announcement of an unreliable list and

261
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:14,839
these moves are drawing the battle lines

262
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,660
through data and technology last week at

263
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,639
Davos you've all her re said when you

264
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:23,269
have enough data you don't need to send

265
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,399
soldiers so the idea of national

266
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:28,510
sovereignty is becoming just as much

267
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:32,209
about data as it is about land and

268
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,550
there's many tools that nations use to

269
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,439
reinstate those borders that have been

270
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,219
broken down by the free use of

271
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,380
technology so we just saw in December

272
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,230
Russia shut down access to the Internet

273
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,110
for 24 hours to test its national

274
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,240
internet and we've seen total Internet

275
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,579
shutdowns in certain regions of India

276
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,380
and Iran over the last few weeks in a

277
00:12:52,579 --> 00:13:00,140
context of political protests so

278
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,720
firewalls are one of these tools to

279
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,370
reinstate these borders and it's not

280
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,199
just the Great Firewall of China

281
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,800
there's firewalls all over the world I

282
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:13,880
just got back from Dubai and in the UAE

283
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:19,279
there's no voice so no FaceTime no Skype

284
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:22,010
no whatsapp no VPNs so the local

285
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,350
alternative is totalk now nothing to do

286
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,689
with tick-tock except for the fact that

287
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,010
they are both accused as being tools for

288
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:33,260
surveillance so when the New York Times

289
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,520
came out with an investigation calling

290
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,050
totalk

291
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,230
an Emirati spy tool the App Store and

292
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,490
Google Play took the app down and

293
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:47,270
Google's only recently kind of very

294
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:49,010
quietly reinstated it so it's really

295
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,770
interesting how it's the New York Times

296
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:58,330
Google and Apple drawing the battle

297
00:13:51,770 --> 00:14:01,520
lines in geopolitics and the EU also is

298
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:06,500
testing national borders in a whole new

299
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,350
way so the EU laws on hate speech have

300
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,060
been applied extraterritorial e there

301
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,030
was a recent case of an Austrian

302
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,569
politician who sued Facebook to expunge

303
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:20,150
comments calling her a lousy traitor and

304
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,370
a fascist and Facebook was required to

305
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,790
remove these comments not just in the EU

306
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,410
but worldwide so very different than the

307
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,640
idea of right to be forgotten which so

308
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:33,860
far has only held up within EU borders

309
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,560
so another tool to bring back this

310
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,200
sovereignty in a digital form is data

311
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,020
localization so the Russian data

312
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,240
protection Authority has stated that any

313
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,120
website aimed at the territory of Russia

314
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,970
or dealing in rubles needs to store its

315
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,550
data in Russia and China's cybersecurity

316
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:56,120
law stipulates that all sensitive data

317
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,729
be kept within China and India's central

318
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,040
bank requires all payment operators to

319
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,020
store the data of Indians in India

320
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,380
although as a couple days ago it looks

321
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,470
like this may be being relaxed a bit so

322
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,990
all of these are examples of digital

323
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:14,120
protectionism every concept we've had

324
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,390
prior in history is just taking another

325
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,310
digital form this can actually increase

326
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,010
cyber security risks as we get these

327
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:25,880
kind of honey pots of data entirely

328
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,710
within national jurisdictions so some of

329
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,340
these initiatives are labeled as digital

330
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:34,040
colonialism as the powers of the world's

331
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:37,610
use technology to assert control in the

332
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:40,089
global south this is a map of undersea

333
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,860
cables previously the domain of telecoms

334
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:46,040
now an arms race between Google and

335
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,730
Huawei so we're all familiar with

336
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,529
digital with

337
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,300
China's brick and Road initiative this

338
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:54,899
would be example of the that's called

339
00:15:51,300 --> 00:16:00,209
the Digital Silk Road but to see how

340
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:02,130
pervasive this is take a look at Cuba so

341
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:06,869
this is a country with very little at

342
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:09,029
stake 11 million people 1 undersea cable

343
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,399
out to Venezuela where all the data goes

344
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:13,620
through I was lucky to go here a couple

345
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,170
times last year for a project for an

346
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:20,190
international client and I saw a way

347
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:23,699
everywhere Russia telecom is following

348
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:26,850
and Google has a memory memorandum of

349
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:30,359
understanding for connectivity so this

350
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:35,790
is what the recolonization of the global

351
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,079
South looks like in a digital age now I

352
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,620
know you in this room are all familiar

353
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,819
with facial recognition the

354
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,980
controversies behind digital

355
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,220
surveillance but for this to get

356
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:50,220
dangerous you need a compulsory national

357
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,740
ID program the US doesn't have a

358
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,810
compulsory ID program most countries do

359
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,380
and increasingly these are going

360
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:01,079
biometric so India's ad Harr has 99

361
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,510
percent of Indians registered and what

362
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,339
is the largest biometric database in the

363
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,720
world

364
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,730
alles thumb and France is following with

365
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,819
the same paradigm and there's many

366
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:15,120
biometric data programs for identity

367
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:18,720
throughout the EU even Iraq Cape Verde

368
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,099
have these programs and increasingly we

369
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,620
are beginning to fear that these are you

370
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:25,109
being used as tools for social

371
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:29,428
manipulation so we hear a lot of Big

372
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:31,020
Brother stories about China and access

373
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:35,040
to transportation based on your social

374
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,480
history you know crazy stories about pet

375
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,178
etiquette and people in their pajamas

376
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,000
being monitored but in the u.s. we have

377
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:44,970
social credit systems we have credit

378
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,370
scores we have legacy admissions to

379
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,429
universities you know many of you

380
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,739
probably came here in preferential

381
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,080
classes of traveler lines based on your

382
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,260
loyalty programs so it's important to

383
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,129
look at these social paradigms through a

384
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,129
cultural lens

385
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:09,350
so what next what do we do

386
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,990
cybersecurity calls for cyber diplomacy

387
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,480
you know we heard yesterday about we

388
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:18,080
need a lexicon even around encryption a

389
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,610
common lexicon and we've gone over some

390
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,590
of these terms today but they're very

391
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:27,139
nuanced you know is smart technology

392
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:29,449
really surveillance technology is that

393
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,760
what we mean and in the u.s. we're

394
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,190
behind on developing roles behind this

395
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,780
we have big tech running the show as we

396
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,760
saw in geopolitics but other nations

397
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,399
like the UAE has a Minister of State for

398
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,280
digital intelligence Denmark has the

399
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,260
world's first tech ambassador and many

400
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,789
countries are following and France has a

401
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:53,270
Secretary of State for the digital

402
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:55,460
sector so in our world today we are

403
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:58,639
learning how to coexist

404
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:02,780
in these new digital spaces that are

405
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:08,350
very quickly replaced our community pubs

406
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:11,059
and summits with world leaders down to

407
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,459
tweets of policy by world leaders and

408
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:16,730
all communication taking place within

409
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:20,030
digital forums you know we have big tech

410
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,440
in the US mega tech in China and they

411
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,809
eat you in between with all the

412
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,309
regulatory framework but with not much

413
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:30,379
to regulate so this is a world where

414
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:33,590
free speech and privacy are in constant

415
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,250
conflict with surveillance where 5g is a

416
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,980
geopolitical issue where undersea cables

417
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,580
are remapping the digital infrastructure

418
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,950
and where world leaders and tech leaders

419
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:51,350
are getting into debates over hacking

420
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:53,960
each other's cell phones so if we know

421
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:57,530
that data is valuable whether or not

422
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:01,190
it's the new oil or the new currency we

423
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:04,820
as a society need to develop privacy

424
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:07,460
standards around that data we need to

425
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,879
either assign it economic value and

426
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,700
compensate the data principals or decide

427
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,040
that it's a human right

428
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,650
tradeable for no value and on the

429
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,500
business and tech side we need standards

430
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:23,230
of interoperability data coalition's

431
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,870
with common language common standards

432
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,360
common values and we need risk

433
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,850
management tools you know when I'm as a

434
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,070
banker in Chile we can create any risk

435
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:37,169
product to protect our clients against

436
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:39,669
say price fluctuations in copper and

437
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:42,880
multinationals hedge all kinds of

438
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:46,870
currency and commodity risks but until

439
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,550
we have these tools for data the human

440
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,600
values that are at the core of all this

441
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:56,350
digital behavior can't prevail in

442
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:00,070
multilateralism so it's our culture and

443
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:03,159
our values that help us and protect us

444
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,260
in our environment and if you'd like to

445
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,720
hear more about this i'm on twitter at

446
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,430
because culture and i am really excited

447
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,810
to see what kind of questions you have

448
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,810
so thanks so much for your time
