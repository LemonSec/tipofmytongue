1
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:30,100
imagine living every dream that you've

2
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:34,690
ever had except seeing it like a reality

3
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:38,910
an image of your city for instance with

4
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:42,849
complete moving traffic patterns a

5
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:47,470
painting of your favorite artist except

6
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:54,039
now you can walk into it and touch every

7
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:56,820
brush stroke in multi-dimension these

8
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:01,750
representations are called virtual

9
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,660
worlds and mark my words pretty soon

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:09,370
they are going to be available to all of

11
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:15,640
us in these virtual wars

12
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:18,130
you can't just see or see an image or an

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,110
object but you can actually interact

14
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,619
with it like we do now with our

15
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:28,110
perceived reality all of this is

16
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:28,110
possible with the use of virtual reality

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,729
this virtual reality technology is

18
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,220
already revolutionising the way

19
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:41,890
computers are used turning them

20
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,560
transforming them from mere Handy tools

21
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,960
to something like a crystal ball where

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,360
you could see into this world more

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:56,530
vividly and gaze into it more deeply

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:02:00,579
reality as we know is being replaced

25
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:06,189
gradually piece by piece with software

26
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:10,810
imitation what we're witnessing now is a

27
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:18,160
great humanistic advance and of course

28
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:20,890
with it it brings real risks I'm Cavia

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,970
Perlman I'm the founder of X our safety

30
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:28,299
initiative in the next 15 to 20 minutes

31
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,490
we will answer the very question are we

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:33,570
ready

33
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:39,690
and then we'll talk about potentially

34
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:43,920
explore the answers to it on December

35
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,500
22nd 2017 my friend Carolyn Wong paid me

36
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,359
a visit at my previous workplace where I

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,480
was the head of security protecting to

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,750
virtual economies any gamers out here

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,079
have probably heard of Second Life

40
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,820
Linden Bob my previous employer had also

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,540
launched another virtual reality

42
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,390
platform called sansaar on this day

43
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,950
Caroline told me that she'd never been

44
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,559
into virtual reality I was like alright

45
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,359
and I knew that she was pregnant so I

46
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
was like okay I know the perfect

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,890
experience for you Caroline so I put her

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,530
on this experience called wonderful.you

49
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,929
its journey of human embryo in the

50
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,770
mother's womb a developmental

51
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:33,510
walkthrough of human life for next and

52
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:36,360
for the nine months it literally teaches

53
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:40,200
you how the senses are developed the

54
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,990
five senses the touch smell sight sound

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,060
all of this needless to say it was a

56
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,880
very compelling experience for Caroline

57
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,830
and for me to witness I also like this

58
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,170
picture particularly because it shows

59
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,170
you that she is using a head-mounted

60
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,940
display goggles to experience we are and

61
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,649
then she has these touch controllers

62
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,290
right below the screen you see the

63
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,320
sensors that potentially coordinate and

64
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,060
allow you allow the system that you

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,660
don't see in the picture it's a heavy

66
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,240
computing GPU computing device that it's

67
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:17,010
connected to so it basically allows you

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,870
to capture these coordinates and make

69
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:23,990
use of it to potentially create an

70
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:26,610
experience there is a misconception that

71
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:29,400
virtual reality is sort of isolating

72
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,880
well there is another aspect of virtual

73
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,909
reality called social be our social vr

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,520
is where you can potentially meet people

75
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,569
in these environments not only talk to

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,058
them interact with them which is

77
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:47,129
I know what I did oftentimes I'm faced

78
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:51,069
with a problem of talking about right

79
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:54,119
securely like topics and I'm often

80
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:56,860
looking for ways to sort of make it fun

81
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:59,679
so in the next clip I'll show you what I

82
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,259
did is created a replica of Taj Mahal in

83
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,938
virtual reality brought in experts and

84
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:08,349
experts joined in from various countries

85
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:10,629
we played games and we did what what I

86
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:14,009
called cybersecurity Awareness Month we

87
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:18,050
organized a whole month long celebration

88
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:47,289
events in PR so let's take a look

89
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:47,289
[Music]

90
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:54,339
[Music]

91
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:24,040
[Music]

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,390
now there is another umbrella term

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:31,210
called XR an XR is referred to all of

94
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,130
these realities under one umbrella term

95
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,109
XR makes extended reality

96
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,520
so let me start with what is virtual

97
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,260
reality it is literally this digital

98
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,510
artificial fully artificial environments

99
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,940
that is digitally created and then there

100
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,340
is the augmented reality most of you are

101
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,260
probably familiar with it the snapchat

102
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,960
filter which basically allows this

103
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,719
digital object overlaid on the real

104
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,820
world environment and then there is the

105
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,920
mixed reality where you can use these

106
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,909
digital environments potentially a

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,220
head-mounted goggle to let's say operate

108
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:11,170
a forklift manipulate the real-world

109
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:14,290
parameters so this XR is inevitably

110
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,600
changing lives we can do a lot of things

111
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,510
it's influencing a lot of industries and

112
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,880
there is predictions that a tremendous

113
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,650
amount of marketplace would be captured

114
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,570
by these technologies well I'm only

115
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,570
going to talk about just the two that

116
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:32,230
I've highlighted in the light blue so

117
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:35,110
real estate imagine now you no longer

118
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:37,660
have to travel to the location to

119
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,640
potentially see a house that you're

120
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,970
about to purchase but if you live in

121
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,430
India my parents do and I can actually

122
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:48,010
show them mom this is the place that I

123
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,260
am going to purchase what do you think

124
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,330
and not only to show them by a

125
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,280
construction but even the lighting the

126
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,820
setting how the Sun rises and whatnot

127
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,859
and this already being used by apps like

128
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,680
Zillow and whatnot they're exploring

129
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,540
these technologies automotive before we

130
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,790
actually manufacture these parts now you

131
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:11,050
can actually create design in virtual

132
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:12,970
reality and think of it it BMW Adie lot

133
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,150
of these companies are already using VR

134
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:21,390
to potentially make sales of their new

135
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:24,370
technology or collect surveys a very

136
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:27,849
amazing use case in terms of automotive

137
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,040
so anybody familiar with autonomous

138
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,820
vehicle testing level five testing is

139
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,979
not even possible because you have

140
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:38,120
to have some of fire testing means there

141
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:40,220
is no driver and because the variables

142
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,380
include human beings it is almost

143
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,020
impossible to test in real time and

144
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,720
that's where virtual reality comes in

145
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:53,000
handy and that's what is being used by

146
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:57,170
lots of these organizations however it's

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,220
bringing new risks along with it think

148
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:05,240
about privacy in the era of constant

149
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:07,670
reality capture using your foot phone or

150
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,310
virtual reality headset which has inside

151
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,930
out tracking and all other you know

152
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,000
behavioral data that is being captured

153
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,729
think about privacy how can that be

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,430
accounted for what about security and

155
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,610
we'll talk about this shortly but lots

156
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,329
of these concerns would rise up because

157
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:30,500
hackers wouldn't really care would they

158
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:34,700
that it's virtual reality trust we've

159
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,860
already witnessed the inability to be

160
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,960
able to separate the truth from the

161
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,010
false with deep fakes and misinformation

162
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,740
and propaganda some big tech

163
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,990
organizations are already using these

164
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,850
platforms to quote and quote defy

165
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:57,860
reality so where would we be able to

166
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:59,870
trust in this scenario and now I'm gonna

167
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,710
talk about some of the novel attacks

168
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:06,500
that were discovered by the researchers

169
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,630
of New Haven University under the

170
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,400
guidance of Ibrahim Virgili a good

171
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:14,900
friend of mine and also the co-founder

172
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:16,819
of X our safety initiative they

173
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,030
discovered these novel attacks and

174
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,980
published them last year and I am really

175
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,839
thankful that they over and over allow

176
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,690
me to present these to people to

177
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,640
indicate what kind of risks could V be

178
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,650
facing with the rise of these

179
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,530
technologies

180
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:37,530
before I go into it however I would like

181
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:40,920
to play this clip where I was at

182
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,390
Augmented World Expo and this is

183
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,430
basically pay attention to the

184
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,430
environment surrounding where I'm

185
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,030
playing a video game called ghost with a

186
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,910
friend

187
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:54,150
are you advisor Marco and were basically

188
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:57,439
in a social vr environment killing bugs

189
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,439
let's take a look

190
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,960
so the attack surface that used to be

191
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,810
just your computer or your network or

192
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:21,500
your back-end devices your aw server has

193
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,660
now expanded so this line the blue line

194
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,150
that now shows that attack surface is

195
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,430
not just your quote-unquote computer

196
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:30,319
systems it has now expanded to your

197
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,439
living room your objects that you

198
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,370
surround and we will see how that is

199
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,270
relevant in a little bit in this

200
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:44,540
research AIDS team Abraham's team

201
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:48,680
basically use these oculus and baibe

202
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:51,980
devices and the one assumption they made

203
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:55,280
is they already compromised the machine

204
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,770
that this devices are tethered to which

205
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,780
you know in today's day and age with

206
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,160
phishing and targeted campaigns

207
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,620
shouldn't be too difficult

208
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,969
once that machine is compromised they

209
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,810
were able to successfully manipulate

210
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,650
configurations modify some of the

211
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:15,290
configs set up a command and control

212
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:18,620
listening server and modify and carry

213
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:23,360
out some of these novel attacks novel

214
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,760
attacks being tracker attack where they

215
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,180
could literally look exactly where

216
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,330
people were looking in VR chaperone

217
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,199
removing the safety boundaries human

218
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:39,100
joystick attack being able to move the

219
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:43,370
subject wherever they wanted and finally

220
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:46,760
overlay attack blocking your vision let

221
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:49,160
me go over it quickly one by one so most

222
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,530
of these virtual reality headsets have a

223
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,079
front facing camera so what aids team

224
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,089
was able to successfully do is turn on

225
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,910
and off the camera without a subjects

226
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:02,180
knowledge and scream the video feedback

227
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,699
to their malicious server or the

228
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,099
attacker look inside the room so now

229
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,920
think about privacy without the

230
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,780
knowledge of the person and every time

231
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,380
you step into any kind of virtual

232
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,589
reality environment you set up imaginary

233
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,480
boundary called the gradient

234
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:23,650
what they were he was able to do is

235
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,890
either expand it shrink it or completely

236
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:29,170
disable it and that's why the video

237
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,910
where I was playing I was killing bugs

238
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,900
with that friend it's relevant because

239
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:37,390
so far we've only witness one death in

240
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:40,780
Russia because of somebody stumbling

241
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,939
from virtual reality some kind of a you

242
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,949
know on some object and dying and we

243
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,300
would never know what the foul play was

244
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:51,430
involved because we don't have these

245
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:54,370
forensics research human joystick attack

246
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,969
so apes team was able to what you see

247
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:01,600
with the red dot at the bottom and I

248
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,850
wonder if I can point that no so the

249
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,310
green dot is literally where the subject

250
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,410
is supposed to be by manipulating these

251
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,869
configurations they were able to move

252
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,140
the subject all the way across the room

253
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:17,770
without their knowledge in multiple of

254
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:21,720
these platforms which is pretty profound

255
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:25,900
and finally this overlay attack were

256
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,090
they literally were able to overtake the

257
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,000
vision think about this new form of

258
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:37,120
ransomware where an attacker would not

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,070
really release this view until you pay X

260
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,880
amount of bitcoins that could possibly

261
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,040
happen so we came up with three risk

262
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,740
mitigation categories when we think

263
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,310
about VR technologies is we need to

264
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,890
protect the input and the output and any

265
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:56,829
kind of a data that goes to either third

266
00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:00,970
party or whatever we need to ensure that

267
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:03,130
data is protected we also need to ensure

268
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:06,340
that user interactions especially in a

269
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:09,310
social we are setting what happens if I

270
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,680
can just send a malicious chat message

271
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,079
or if I'm a developer on these

272
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,849
technologies what if I just embed some

273
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,130
of these virtual objects with malicious

274
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,610
code you click it and I have already

275
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:23,140
initiated a warlike scenario and finally

276
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,450
the device protection what about

277
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,020
authentication on these devices but if

278
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,780
somebody else

279
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,889
impersonates me or takes over these

280
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,350
devices

281
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:35,049
and does something malicious so we need

282
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:40,389
to think about these categories and this

283
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:43,649
is a clip from March 7 2018 I was

284
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:46,509
working at Linden Lab and suddenly a

285
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:48,609
friend of a colleague comes up and says

286
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,290
hey you know what all of these devices

287
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:52,660
are bricked basically there was a

288
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,290
runtime error for for a few minutes and

289
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:58,118
then within seconds I realized Oh first

290
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,579
I thought oh my god it's happening

291
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:04,619
and then within few seconds I realize

292
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:06,969
it's just somebody at Facebook forgot to

293
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:09,759
update the firmware certificate

294
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,879
rendering these devices bricked for 24

295
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,839
hours and these kinds of things could

296
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:20,410
also be used as an attack vector so an

297
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:22,899
ex RSI this is precisely our mission is

298
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,779
to try to help build safe immersive

299
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:29,079
environments and we are doing this via

300
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:31,809
many many different projects one of the

301
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,939
main projects that I'm very honored to

302
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:36,639
announce here is X our bug bounty

303
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:39,879
program Y here specifically with because

304
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:43,149
this industry needs security researchers

305
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:47,739
we need hackers to stay ahead of the bad

306
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:50,290
guys so we are working on building X our

307
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:52,809
bug bounty program where you could

308
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:55,299
actually hack virtual reality and report

309
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:58,540
findings and we would potentially gather

310
00:16:55,299 --> 00:17:01,119
those findings to do more work we have

311
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:03,368
also rolled out in November 3 C

312
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:05,679
information security framework that is

313
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:09,490
still a work in progress and any one of

314
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,380
you can be a part of it by contacting ex

315
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,480
RSI because it's still ongoing and

316
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,490
finally we're working with National

317
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,559
Cyber Security Alliance on their stop

318
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,380
think connect campaign because this is

319
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:22,928
very important that we spread awareness

320
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,029
of these risks so we're helping them

321
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:27,850
update the campaign stop think connect

322
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,769
in 2020 when we do the cybersecurity

323
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,469
awareness month you will start to see

324
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:36,100
these kinds of new risks being promoted

325
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:38,559
and in terms of awareness and this is

326
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,990
what the 3 C framework looks like where

327
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,820
we are now accounting for things that

328
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,420
previously were not accounted for when

329
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,800
people

330
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,760
met with each other in these

331
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:51,820
environments why not we think about

332
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,790
harassment vandalism defamation

333
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,500
these are risks that nobody in the

334
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,330
security community talks about until

335
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,160
something really bad happens and even

336
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,320
then regulations that were left behind

337
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,410
there are no laws so this is our

338
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:09,280
opportunity to address things that were

339
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:12,870
not addressed in previous platforms and

340
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,700
think about what would happen when I use

341
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:19,209
virtual reality or augmented reality to

342
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:22,630
potentially order a pizza or hey Siri

343
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:26,200
order me you know uber so the women

344
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:29,290
integrally now has to be kept you know

345
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,250
would have to be validated now that's

346
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:35,680
why it also incorporates confines so if

347
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,360
you want to be a part of this bug bounty

348
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,790
program which I encourage all of you

349
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,729

350
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:46,000
email bug bounty program at exerci and

351
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,490
for any other projects info and exerci

352
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,400
and I'm going to conclude this with one

353
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:55,230
saying from Mother Teresa there are

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,780
things that I can do that you can't

355
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:02,470
there are things that you can do that I

356
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,360
count but together we can do great

357
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,600
things

358
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,600
