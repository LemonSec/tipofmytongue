1
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,360
all right good morning everyone thank

2
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,820
you for coming early on the last day of

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,930
what's been a great conference so far

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,349
I'm really excited to talk about

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,579
disinformation and the the challenges

6
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:31,520
we're dealing with data integrity and

7
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:34,879
Trust on the Internet and so we've got a

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,250
great panel today I know that Danielle

9
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,460
mentioned on Monday we were originally

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,110
had a third a panel member as well

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,579
Camille Francoise does she unfortunately

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,800
couldn't no longer make it but she sends

13
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,960
her regrets and I think we have a

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,610
phenomenal panel still so I'd like to

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,879
first start off with is just some quick

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:54,170
introductions and so start within each

17
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,489
of our panel members or just give you a

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,039
little bit of a background themselves as

19
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:00,530
well because each of us bring fairly

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,390
different perspectives and come from

21
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,160
different roles and how we approach this

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,509
information and so I think across it I

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,820
think there's some unique perspectives

24
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:10,130
that help guide and our experiences help

25
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,529
guide some where insights on on this

26
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,990
important issue so start with Melanie

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,490
and signed to my right she is the head

28
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,100
of security privacy and engineering

29
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,169
communication at uber and then we also

30
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,970
have Renee de Resta who's the research

31
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,880
manager at Stanford internet observatory

32
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,349
and I'm Andrea little embargo so I'll be

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,660
chiming in a little bit as well

34
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:30,830
my background arose in academia as a

35
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,590
political scientist to some

36
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,330
computational social science and the

37
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,229
Department of Defense before going to a

38
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,450
couple of different startups that focus

39
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,390
on security and protection and so a lot

40
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,459
of my my input that you'll see is guided

41
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,039
by both government academic and then

42
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:50,539
more private sector research that I've

43
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,910
been doing and looking at how the

44
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:54,920
different organizations and groups

45
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,060
actually look at dis information it's

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,310
not a little bit where I will be coming

47
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,450
from Mellie do you want to hold it on

48
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:06,229
your background so my background I

49
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:08,539
actually uh my initial background is

50
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,369
actually in marine biology I wanted to

51
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:16,220
be a shark scientist when I was growing

52
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:18,980
up I ended up in a PR agency actually

53
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:23,300
after college working on environmental

54
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:25,670
communication so my graduate studies and

55
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,469
my my master's thesis was really focused

56
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,369
on corporate sustainability and the role

57
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:30,500
of

58
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,379
corporate communicators not solely in

59
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,140
the dissemination of messaging but how

60
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:39,109
to actually be the conduit for external

61
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,708
feedback so that companies were making

62
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,060
more informed decisions about their

63
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:47,629
environmental footprint and in various

64
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,280
corporate sustainability efforts like a

65
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:52,280
lot of people in security I think I got

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,290
here by accident but I will say that

67
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,650
sharks and hackers have a lot in common

68
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,260
so I do get to use a lot of of what I

69
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,780
learned in school I started my

70
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,269
communication career in an agency I

71
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,160
worked in an agency as a consultant for

72
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:10,549
about six years with different security

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,359
clients mostly non security companies

74
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:16,340
who were trying to educate customers and

75
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,890
other stakeholders on various security

76
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,440
issues and because of that I've been

77
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,950
exposed to the good the bad and the ugly

78
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,829
when it comes to communication as a as a

79
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,540
business so a little bit later on and

80
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:32,870
we'll talk about some of the the

81
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,108
industry infrastructure and incentives

82
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,790
that are contributing to misinformation

83
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:40,340
with marketing and advertising and

84
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,250
public relations and then I came to

85
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:47,030
Silicon Valley I've now been at uber for

86
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:49,480
almost four years and so you know like I

87
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,549
mentioned I will be discussing a lot of

88
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,380
the legitimate business practices that

89
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,840
are actually enabling some of the

90
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:01,160
campaign's that Andrea and Renee will

91
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,900
touch on hi

92
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,470
Renee - Resta I'm at Stanford Internet

93
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,120
Observatory now my background way back

94
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,230
was actually computer science and

95
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,419
political science and I minored in

96
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,709
Russian and that was in 2004 so my

97
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,349
parents didn't really understand why I

98
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,959
was doing that and the honest answer was

99
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:19,430
I wanted to take a foreign language and

100
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,200
I basically failed out of both Arabic

101
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:25,400
and Hindi and down into Russian so I'm

102
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,979
the political science was because it was

103
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,479
a nice GPA boost versus the engineering

104
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:34,580
classes I was taking for being totally

105
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:35,960
candid here I I had a kind of a winding

106
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,419
career path actually went to Wall Street

107
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,919
I was a quant trader at a company called

108
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,820
Jane Street for a while I was a market

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,289
maker I did a lot of financial

110
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:48,390
and then after that I came out here and

111
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,130
I started doing venture capital for with

112
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,440
Tim O'Reilly and that was sort of my

113
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,670
first exposure to the valley and this

114
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,650
was during the social mobile local

115
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,940
revolution when everybody was very

116
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,520
excited about getting like geo-fenced

117
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,920
coupons and nobody wondered about you

118
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,900
know the tracking aspects of you know

119
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,420
what it took to give you those geofence

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:11,250
coupons and admittedly really I didn't

121
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:12,570
either so that was what wound up taking

122
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,070
me into the realm of disinformation and

123
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,409
misinformation was actually having my

124
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,980
first kid in 2013 and then starting to

125
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:23,400
look at anti-vaccine narratives I was on

126
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:25,800
Facebook as probably most people are and

127
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,599
I started getting recommendation engine

128
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,930
suggestions for things like anti vaccine

129
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,310
groups because I had a baby and once you

130
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,350
have a baby you start engaging in those

131
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,640
communities it's like targets on you

132
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,810
know pushing you the ads for like all

133
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,250
the baby furniture and baby clothes

134
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,250
Facebook it's like here I have a have a

135
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:46,380
90 vaccine group so notice how it was in

136
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:48,420
2015 we're sorry 20 2013 what what I

137
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,980
wound up doing was actually starting to

138
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,570
map some of the communication networks

139
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,040
just using social network analysis

140
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,349
looking at how communications were

141
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,120
happening on Twitter looking at ways in

142
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,800
which small groups of people were able

143
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,510
to sort of disproportionately amplify a

144
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,190
point of view in part because the

145
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,630
counter voices weren't there in part

146
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,640
because sensational content was

147
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,560
performing well in part because really

148
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,450
basic rudimentary automation could still

149
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,600
get things trending back during that

150
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,370
time frame in 2015 2016 and I became

151
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,870
kind of an activist about it so before

152
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,730
going into academia I really did a lot

153
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,200
of this looking at it from the point of

154
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,340
view of like a very frustrated parent

155
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,510
actually subsequent to that I wound up

156
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,580
working on some of the counter Isis

157
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,099
efforts the kind of counter propaganda

158
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,560
how do we think about societal responses

159
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:35,310
when the social ecosystem becomes a vast

160
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,630
propaganda communication machine and and

161
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,340
after doing that work through a series

162
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,270
of kind of weird events I wound up doing

163
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,310
the Senate Intelligence Committee

164
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,140
research into the Russia data set so I'd

165
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,790
led one of the teams that did the

166
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,240
evaluation of the internet research

167
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,880
agency data in 2018 and then the GRU the

168
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,020
military intelligence operation the hack

169
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,050
and leak operation in

170
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,639
in 2019 so we published that in late

171
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,440
October of 2019 so I'm going to talk a

172
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,030
little bit about comparatively what we

173
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,569
saw between these two different

174
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:07,750
adversaries operating simultaneously

175
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:10,389
over that period okay great thank you

176
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,949
and so our panel will have a little bit

177
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,129
of a different structure than some of

178
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:16,599
the other ones and what we want to do

179
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:18,009
originally it's a layout that

180
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,110
misinformation about disinformation you

181
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:22,720
know in discussing and preparing for the

182
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,889
panel you know with a variety of

183
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,419
different campaigns we could just dive

184
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,069
right into you but for us and we thought

185
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,690
was very important just to lay the

186
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,130
foundation and make sure everyone's you

187
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,060
know on the same page as far as the sort

188
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,009
of the state of affairs with

189
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,630
disinformation what is what what's not

190
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:36,909
because there is a ton of misinformation

191
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,469
about disinformation and so we'll go

192
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:40,300
through a couple of different myths for

193
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,729
the first half of the panel and then

194
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,289
we'll each go into Melanie and Renee go

195
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,758
in some different use cases and

196
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:47,500
campaigns that will come up here and

197
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,000
walk through some slides and go more

198
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,159
into more detail on the specific

199
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,960
research and it'll conclude looking at

200
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,550
some potential solutions and how to

201
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,180
address this with this growing challenge

202
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,919
before getting into Q&A so we're gonna

203
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,599
do is just kick off with debunking some

204
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,880
of the myths and misinformation that's

205
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,349
out there about disinformation and one

206
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,000
of the first ones and what you see it

207
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:08,650
every day I think and then in the news

208
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,389
right now is that you miss information

209
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,159
this information are used at the same

210
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,590
time or to mean the exact same thing

211
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,270
within the various you know clickbait

212
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,349
news feeds that we see and so first

213
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,120
thing we wanted to do is sort of just

214
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:20,949
break down and get some some of the

215
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,199
vernacular some the jargon down and some

216
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,880
of the some of the terminology clarified

217
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:30,789
and so I think Renee we'll start with

218
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:32,950
that yes so one of the things that we've

219
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,208
tried to think about as we begin to

220
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,659
think about countering these things in

221
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,919
early 2017 we started working on

222
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,958
taxonomy is for describing the kind of

223
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,390
nature of problems claire Wordle at

224
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,479
first draft roughly bucketed it into a

225
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,640
concept called information disorder and

226
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,290
as we segmented out things that were

227
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,819
like inadvertently wrong so just

228
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,360
misinformation things that were wrong

229
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,899
online from this information which the

230
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,170
pizza there is actually an allusion to

231
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:04,410
pizza geeks I was happening kind of it

232
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,420
just happened

233
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,339
but the idea that then there were people

234
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,880
who were doing things that with a

235
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,620
deliberate intent to mislead and deceive

236
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,569
started looking at ways in which the

237
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,370
difference between intent were there

238
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:19,769
ways to kind of quantify or understand a

239
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,110
notion of intent in understanding how we

240
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:24,449
treated these things because something

241
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,350
that was accidentally wrong is very

242
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,060
different than something that is

243
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,920
deliberately wrong in terms of the

244
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,619
intent of the actor behind it to

245
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,199
communicate it to people then there was

246
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,519
propaganda which was just kind of you

247
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,170
know it's communication with an agenda

248
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,839
but it's a thing that's been around for

249
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,160
centuries and so some of our attempt to

250
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,930
understand where that kind of

251
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,300
delineation between propaganda and

252
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:48,120
disinformation was actually took us back

253
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,370
to definitions from the early 1920s

254
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,060
through to the 1960s an understanding of

255
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:57,839
propaganda as having kind of black white

256
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,130
and gray types white propaganda is quite

257
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,509
easily attributable it's something that

258
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,579
will come out from a state that will

259
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:04,860
have a state logo on it Artie is a great

260
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,630
example of this you know exactly what it

261
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,209
is if you're remotely familiar with the

262
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:13,199
media ecosystem then there's this kind

263
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:14,939
of slow spectrum that takes you down

264
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:18,060
into the realm of subversive propaganda

265
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:21,449
where the actor is obscured the funder

266
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,888
is obscured the reason that it exists is

267
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:25,170
obscured and so you find yourself

268
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,850
looking at things that are communicating

269
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,540
information with a very particular slant

270
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,279
but are not it's not quite clear who's

271
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,709
behind it or why and that's where this

272
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:38,040
information kind of rolls up as a tactic

273
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:40,709
and in black propaganda operations fake

274
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,779
news was information that was

275
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:44,279
demonstrably false that was the way that

276
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,899
it originally was intended to be used

277
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,689
before it became anything I don't like

278
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,089
on the internet and with fake news in

279
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,980
particular a lot of the motivation there

280
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:55,139
was economic so people who were

281
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,220
economically motivated or behaving again

282
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:58,050
differently than people who are

283
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,480
motivated ideologically are people who

284
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,949
are you know running a state-sponsored

285
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,259
campaign and so we tried to have a

286
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,969
different you know conceptualization of

287
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,009
fake news which in many ways was

288
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,689
actually quite similar to spam sort of

289
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:11,250
an evolution of kind of like a Content

290
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:13,319
spam type model where people would write

291
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,970
sensationalist content largely for the

292
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:16,769
purpose of driving someone to a web site

293
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,600
that had a high ad load and

294
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:21,089
capitalizing on that and that was as you

295
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,939
may recall in 2016 the Macedonian

296
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,800
teenagers sites that were running things

297
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:27,629
that you know articles like Pope

298
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,429
endorses Donald Trump and sensationalist

299
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:32,730
content that was likely to get clicks

300
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:34,970
and then finally filter bubbles that was

301
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:39,779
our way of kind of conceptualizing how

302
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:43,350
the information that you see is in some

303
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,579
ways bounded by the environments that

304
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,679
you participate in

305
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,299
so filter bubbles have kind of evolved

306
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,299
now into conversations a little bit more

307
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,279
about echo chambers or my term for it

308
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,350
and I was like the spoke realities where

309
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,720
you have these you're in some ways

310
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,549
actively choosing to participate in some

311
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,649
of these siloed media environments but

312
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:04,319
when you're in there you are seeing

313
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,179
media kind of not only you know kind of

314
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:08,099
chosen in part because of a particular

315
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:10,139
political alignment position or interest

316
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,519
you hold but then you're also kind of

317
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,869
telegraphing your interest and it

318
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,089
provides an interesting vector for

319
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:17,249
people who want to transmit malign

320
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,199
information of the black propaganda or

321
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:23,209
disinformation variety to people who

322
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:23,209
have particular inclinations to start

323
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,649
okay

324
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:30,209
great didn't I think we increasing our

325
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,730
seeing is more awareness about each of

326
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,589
these and are you notice that are people

327
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,179
responding any differently online or do

328
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:37,619
with growing awareness do you think to

329
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,129
the various kinds or do you think that

330
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:43,319
behavior is still almost absent it any

331
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:46,139
understanding of some of the variations

332
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:47,160
and and how how much data is actually

333
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,499
supporting a lot of information that's

334
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,959
out there I think there's there's more

335
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:53,670
awareness that it happens that's kind of

336
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:55,018
a double-edged sword because now you see

337
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,170
everybody screaming fake news all the

338
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,839
time or a Russian bot all the time so

339
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,969
there's a there's an awareness that the

340
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,669
information you see online is not

341
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,290
necessarily the of the you know kind of

342
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:09,269
degree of integrity you might have seen

343
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:14,519
you were getting it from your library or

344
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:17,970
even from less economically incentivized

345
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,769
in media environments and so we're

346
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,360
differently incentive Isis maybe but

347
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:23,160
that's where I think we we see this

348
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,049
rising awareness it doesn't necessarily

349
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,240
translate into the ability to detect it

350
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:29,249
in the moment which is why you still see

351
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,700
people sharing things like coronavirus

352
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:32,770
conspiracy theories

353
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,960
because even the act of doing the

354
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,250
fact-check is very difficult still it's

355
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,340
hard to know where to fact-check

356
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:42,280
to wikipedia is kind of the default at

357
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,080
this point but in the moment people just

358
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,400
hit the retweet button because they you

359
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,540
know we're trying to like push the

360
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,370
message along even if the message is a

361
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,770
graph of a you know distribution pattern

362
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,610
of a disease that's not real yeah

363
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,949
interesting even though along the

364
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,990
fact-check sites even some of those

365
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,980
actually tend to be you know hidden

366
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,110
disinformation within it that are

367
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,240
actually not there fact check sites with

368
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,550
a with an agenda and so even there it

369
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,290
makes it very hard so cruelly it's a

370
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,760
complicated landscape yeah at a at a

371
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,280
minimum and i think it's growing in

372
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,260
complexity which leads into one of the

373
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,480
next topics is that when we think about

374
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,650
it we often think about the election in

375
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,790
the united states we think about when

376
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,590
you think about disinformation and fake

377
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,300
news and interference we often think

378
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,060
about the the 2016 election that seems

379
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,709
to be the dominant paradigm but the

380
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,760
reality is that it actually is much

381
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,750
bigger than elections you mention the

382
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,240
corona virus and some of those

383
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,190
conspiracy theories it smelly what we'll

384
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,250
touch upon some the broader motivations

385
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,500
that are driving this information and in

386
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,940
their impact yes sure everybody likes to

387
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,590
hear that the problem space is actually

388
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:46,300
bigger than we thought so I do think the

389
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,980
current events in politics I think have

390
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,439
raised awareness to some of these things

391
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,760
but the the reality is is that a lot of

392
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,900
the the objectives the motivations for

393
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,330
for these types of campaigns have

394
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,430
existed for thousands of years what we

395
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,530
are seeing now is kind of a new flavor

396
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:04,420
because of the technology and in the

397
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:07,660
various distribution platforms that we

398
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,040
now have so if you think about even you

399
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,469
know those of us that deal with like

400
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,110
cybersecurity defense understanding the

401
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,060
motivations of our they really

402
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,470
adversaries and misinformation perhaps

403
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,060
I'm gonna call them adversaries I'm

404
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,880
thinking about the motivations of your

405
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,420
adversaries is key to understanding the

406
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,000
defense

407
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,920
I'm key to being able to understand when

408
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,540
somebody is trying to manipulate you or

409
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,939
even to be able to identify your own

410
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:34,360
vulnerabilities and weaknesses so very

411
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,420
similar to the types of motivations that

412
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,620
we see technically in terms of

413
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,780
cybersecurity attacks you know there's

414
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,990
financial motivation ideological

415
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,350
motivation it can be political but it

416
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,280
can

417
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:51,550
you know go well beyond elections and

418
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,199
it's interesting there's a lot I think

419
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,510
when we looked at those categories that

420
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,100
that you had Rene sometimes it can be

421
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,410
really hard to distinguish between

422
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,750
something that's propaganda versus

423
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:05,949
something that is just a a policy

424
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:08,700
awareness effort but knowing that these

425
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,350
types of motivations and objectives

426
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,170
exist is the first step and actually

427
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,440
being able to identify what the message

428
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:20,170
is who the messenger is but also what

429
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,080
what's expected of you I think just

430
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,819
building resiliency to other people's

431
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,410
messages is also something that's that's

432
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,210
really important and I think that that

433
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,240
is an analogy that makes sense to a lot

434
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,320
of us that work in InfoSec because we

435
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,810
are essentially trying to build

436
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,660
resilient networks and systems and when

437
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,890
it comes to misinformation and just

438
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,120
disinformation we need to build

439
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:44,710
resilient individuals you know thanks

440
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,910
and then as far as you know looking at

441
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,250
some of these in a little bit more

442
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,719
detail beyond the politics beyond

443
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,000
elections or something might be more

444
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,020
targeted I think I'm christening and

445
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,430
seeing you which there was some stock

446
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,569
where discussion last night here and

447
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,010
he's starting to see some more of the

448
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,250
targeting both on individuals and as

449
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,450
companies I think similar to them have

450
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,500
motivations are growing I think some the

451
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:07,569
targets and the victims have a lot of

452
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,770
disinformation tax is a broad range of

453
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,899
actors as well I'll see very similar

454
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,010
sourcing in cyber on that side too so

455
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,630
there are some parallels why should I

456
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,450
think are interesting to look at and

457
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,980
that in that realm then especially if we

458
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,690
look at some of the politics beyond the

459
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,730
elections you have some of the social

460
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,110
divisions that are created and are some

461
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,550
of the main efforts you're those get

462
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,949
into both geopolitical efforts but there

463
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,840
also can be you driven by various kinds

464
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,600
of you know almost grassroots levels

465
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,550
social societal unrest not if you want

466
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,070
to add anything else to this or we've

467
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,240
got it covered

468
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,230
yeah and that's why all these will be

469
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,330
coming up throughout some of the

470
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,370
campaigns as well but first we really

471
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,350
want to just lay the landscape out for

472
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:48,760
everyone make sure we understand just

473
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:49,990
how broad and you know widespread some

474
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,120
these aspects are make sure we're on the

475
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,220
same page and so which gets into you on

476
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,389
the next aspects actually gets into you

477
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,350
and when we think about disinformation I

478
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,789
think probably most people think about

479
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,728
Russia please the United States that's

480
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:03,700
that seems to be almost used hand in

481
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:05,200
hand and unfortunately it is not just

482
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,299
limited to Russia up I knee stretch the

483
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,590
imagination and so Renee will go into a

484
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:14,309
little bit of the landscape of the who's

485
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:21,340
who in this area in the next one oh

486
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:23,619
there we go yeah seriously yeah so one

487
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,908
of the opportunities I've had over the

488
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,709
last few years as I mentioned I started

489
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:28,359
looking at conspiracy theorists and then

490
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,129
I worked on the counterterrorism and

491
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,019
then following that state actors

492
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:34,928
I personally focus primarily on state

493
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:38,379
actors now but our understanding is a

494
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:40,570
little bit you know the infrastructure

495
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:42,309
of the social ecosystem is what provides

496
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,349
the opportunity to run these campaigns

497
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,149
and because it's low cost and low

498
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:47,529
barrier to entry and there's really no

499
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,969
consequences and you're gonna lose your

500
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:51,429
account like a big deal it's not

501
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,409
significant deterrence what we see is

502
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:54,759
that increasing numbers of different

503
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:57,789
types of actors across the political

504
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,289
spectrum across the world have chosen to

505
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:01,119
participate in this in part because they

506
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,859
believe that if they don't they're kind

507
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,720
of seeding the ground to their political

508
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:06,879
opponents and so we do see it actually

509
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,539
quite a bit and it is a global problem

510
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:13,209
state actors are the best resourced so

511
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:15,220
particularly Russia Russia is the most

512
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,139
sophisticated I would say of the

513
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,710
adversaries that that I've had an

514
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:22,238
opportunity to do firsthand research on

515
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,519
there's an extraordinary commitment to a

516
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,099
long game that we see out of Russia that

517
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:30,190
we haven't seen to the same extent from

518
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:32,470
others Iran may be a little bit Saudi

519
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:36,609
Arabia and China and in their social

520
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:39,369
influence campaigns they kind of throw

521
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:41,168
up you know BOTS and automated accounts

522
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:42,759
and sock puppets at opportune political

523
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:45,129
times but they don't really have the

524
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:46,629
same evidence of the deep long sustained

525
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:49,178
commitment to these campaigns that we

526
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:51,759
see from from Russia and again to a

527
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,320
slightly lesser extent Iran the

528
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,080
terrorists use it mostly as a propaganda

529
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,029
recruitment tool and it's much more of a

530
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,859
kind of a radicalization and recruitment

531
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:01,359
cycle so they put out their propaganda

532
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,189
Isis used to do this on Twitter all the

533
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,869
time but the goal was really always to

534
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,629
pull people into private messaging apps

535
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:10,119
so they would use propaganda in part

536
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:11,320
because having overt propaganda is

537
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,870
actually kind of a sign that scene is

538
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,149
sign of power it's it's demonstrating

539
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,649
that you are putting on a message as

540
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:19,090
yourself you are an organization you are

541
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,670
a force to be reckoned with you are

542
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,770
official and so propaganda for an

543
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,540
organization like Isis is used to

544
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,360
reinforce the perception that they are

545
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,649
effectively a state actor but and that

546
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,959
was how they wanted to be seen at the

547
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,030
time so that type of behavior is much

548
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,700
more to kind of reinforce the glory of

549
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:39,129
the Caliphate and then to recruit people

550
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,150
into these kind of private channels when

551
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,030
they would engage with the content

552
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,230
online domestic ideologues again this is

553
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,820
the really hard one right this is you

554
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,680
know got a Pepe up there but there's

555
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,500
another couple of Twitter icons I could

556
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,970
have just as easily been and that's

557
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,670
because what we see again is that where

558
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,460
is that line between coordinated and

559
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,590
authentic activity and digital activism

560
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,880
and in our early understanding of the

561
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,620
problem we thought about it from the

562
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,870
standpoint of like who is the actor is a

563
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,129
Russia oh then it's fake but then we

564
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,229
began to look at it from the standpoint

565
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,430
of overlapping techniques with spam and

566
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,650
things like that and looking at it more

567
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,930
as a kind of behavioral models and

568
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:17,440
dissemination models as opposed to who

569
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:19,150
is behind it the other two the you know

570
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,710
spammers I mentioned again just kind of

571
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,540
financially motivated but they're really

572
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:27,670
remarkably you know kind of at the front

573
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,960
lines of trying things out and then the

574
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:31,450
true believers are more than a kind of

575
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,700
conspiratorial groups that are wholly

576
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,190
ideologically motivated and in some ways

577
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:40,810
do kind of overlap with the domestic

578
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:43,060
ideologues great thank you and so

579
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,159
clearly again very similar to on the

580
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:49,870
cyber domain where we see a lot of tax

581
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:52,030
the the actual attacker set of a set of

582
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,860
actors doing it as expanding a ton same

583
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,520
things went on with disinformation which

584
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,260
we did actually a good segue into you

585
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,270
know we have not yet talked about any

586
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,770
kinds of exploits or vulnerabilities or

587
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:06,040
compromising machines or anything along

588
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,540
those lines so why you know why are we

589
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,850
even having a panel on just information

590
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,940
without a security and privacy

591
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:14,620
conference and so I I was actually asked

592
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,480
I presented something at Derby con

593
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,679
several years ago that looked at the

594
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,300
integration of cyberattacks and

595
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,830
disinformation and there's actually

596
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,780
discussion among the audience as far as

597
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,120
whether it's even an appropriate topic

598
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,050
for the security community

599
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,370
and there was a actually new string back

600
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,570
and forth where some people felt very

601
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,370
strong late it's not and some people

602
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:33,010
felt very strongly that it is and so

603
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,840
this is a next one to it next myth to

604
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,490
address and I think all of us believe

605
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,350
that it we are here so we believe it it

606
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,490
is very relevant for the work that we're

607
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,719
all doing within this community and I

608
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,630
think Melanie will talk some about that

609
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,059
sure so the first thing I want to say is

610
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,790
for people who think that cybersecurity

611
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:52,350
and the industry of information security

612
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:54,639
is really just about data protection

613
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,449
things are gonna change very quickly for

614
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,340
you we have already seen a trend in the

615
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,740
industry were some of these

616
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:06,669
non-traditional cyber issues whether

617
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,980
it's fraud or platform abuse or you know

618
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,260
integrity these things are falling

619
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,190
within the responsibility of security

620
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,530
teams within organizations you know the

621
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:20,410
big platform teams I I remember a time

622
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:22,750
when like the spam fighting teams used

623
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:26,110
to be different from the data protection

624
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:29,080
teams they all work together now so the

625
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:33,040
this issue of disinformation is

626
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,100
increasingly being expected for security

627
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:40,090
teams to actually address that being

628
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,610
said there's also as Andrea mentioned

629
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:45,070
this intersection between what's being

630
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,428
called like cyber-enabled disinformation

631
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,889
so there there is an overlap between

632
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:53,410
cyberattacks and in Rene Mathis as well

633
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,470
with you know trying to hack accounts

634
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,670
that have influence that you can then

635
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,880
spread information so there's a number

636
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:03,190
of areas where that overlaps but the

637
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,100
thing that I think is probably most

638
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,960
important for this group here is

639
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,409
recognizing how we as a community are in

640
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,600
fact contributing to the problem if any

641
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,929
of you have a Twitter account and follow

642
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,010
anyone in InfoSec you probably have some

643
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:25,630
inkling of our community's own somewhat

644
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:29,440
inability to discern correct information

645
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:32,320
and not to propagate miss information or

646
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,170
even disinformation social media is

647
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,730
definitely a difficult area for us as a

648
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,230
community I would consider to be our

649
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,680
Achilles heel

650
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,700
in terms of information integrity we are

651
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,880
quick to judge

652
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,470
we have knee-jerk reactions we love to

653
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,340
share information that we disagree with

654
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,540
which by the way is counterproductive

655
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:58,360
and you know at the same time we have

656
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:02,680
quite a few very loud voices that love

657
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:06,370
to use social media as well as

658
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,980
traditional media and to spread their

659
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:15,030
own version of whatever they considered

660
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:17,410
to be truth and that's problematic

661
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,060
because we have a lot of people who are

662
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:20,590
presenting commentary on things that

663
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,899
they don't actually understand and

664
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,459
there's a whole I think a whole separate

665
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,950
talk and discussion about our

666
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,350
relationship with the press and the

667
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,710
press is commitment to fact-checking and

668
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:35,800
accuracy as well but you know I do want

669
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,690
to note you know that we as a community

670
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,129
to be a lot more discerning and a lot

671
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,140
more careful about what we're sharing if

672
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,740
you see an article that is technically

673
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:47,080
inaccurate don't share it with a mean

674
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,500
comment about it I will tell you the

675
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,449
hardest thing or the worst thing you can

676
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,670
do if you're trying to get a publication

677
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,830
to actually issue a correction on

678
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:59,800
something is to make that piece of

679
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:01,750
content so popular that an editor or the

680
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,740
editors senior editor is scared to

681
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:08,160
change it I several years ago I spoke

682
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,640
with a tech editor at a publication

683
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:15,250
because they had put up a video

684
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,630
seemingly about like privacy tips for

685
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,540
consumers about a whole bunch of

686
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:21,010
different technologies and products and

687
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:25,659
one of the things that they were

688
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:27,970
mentioning was a Chrome extension that

689
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:30,940
would allow you to change the UI of a

690
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,740
certain website and in order to use this

691
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:37,540
Chrome extension you had to give it

692
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:40,210
complete owner rights to your account so

693
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,790
you know here's a news outlet that was

694
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:46,330
promoting the use of a highly invasive

695
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:49,000
Chrome extension simply in order to give

696
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,070
people the ability to change a website

697
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,200
UI and when I reached out to the

698
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,928
in order to explain to them this was not

699
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,750
only inaccurate but also very dangerous

700
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:00,639
advice for consumers the response I got

701
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:02,519
was the most popular video on our site

702
00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:05,350
right now we're not changing it

703
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,389
so I do think it's really important for

704
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,689
us as a community to be aware of the

705
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:13,120
fact that sometimes our rage is actually

706
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:17,380
fueling the Machine that we are in fact

707
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,908
trying to fight great thank you and so I

708
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,919
think hopefully as we go out throughout

709
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,690
the panel you'll see more and more this

710
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:24,220
intersection of both the with the role

711
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,179
of our community the role cyber-enabled

712
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,500
disinformation and just the broader

713
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:30,850
focus setting as I wonder stream moves

714
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,740
towards information integrity and I

715
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,059
think that at least to me that's one of

716
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,529
the things that I actually was asked by

717
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:37,120
someone a little while ago and what am I

718
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,679
looking at now that wasn't hearing much

719
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,330
about six months ago and I think

720
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:41,769
information and data integrity was

721
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,000
around a little bit then not a Sarah

722
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:45,090
using those words but this just this

723
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,230
notion of integrity really starting to

724
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:49,209
become more and more irrelevant and

725
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:53,049
that's a role that we all have something

726
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,340
to play a role to play in that area and

727
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,929
so on the last myth that we'll get on

728
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,149
will cover real quick before getting

729
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:59,500
into some of the campaigns is really

730
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:00,850
this notion that it's mainly you're

731
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,799
coming from abroad and that says

732
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,870
generally a foreign nation state actor

733
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,000
and just to go quickly on to this

734
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,418
because I think especially in the night

735
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,220
States as we get into twenty20 elections

736
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm still very much worried that we're

737
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,000
still looking at 2020 that were in

738
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,610
expecting 2016 to happen again when it's

739
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,470
a whole you're things have evolved if

740
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:23,289
you look at you know what happened in

741
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:25,899
2016 moving on to 2018 and now there's

742
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:27,370
more actors there's more tactics and

743
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:30,219
there's domestic and international if

744
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,840
you just look at you know just an on the

745
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,059
election side on election interference

746
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,570
this is from freedom house freedom on

747
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:36,850
the net

748
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,168
and domestic actor has interfered online

749
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,699
in 26 of 30 countries that they are

750
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,039
looking at the head elections or

751
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,330
referendums and so if you look at you

752
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,360
look more into the details of some of

753
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:48,309
those some of it was shutting off

754
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,860
information so that's one aspect of it

755
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,389
the other aspect of it was pushing out

756
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,580
misleading information coming from

757
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:57,370
domestic actors and so it could be

758
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,860
everything from the BOTS to the to

759
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,379
state-run media sites to other kinds of

760
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,699
web sites and spam and so forth it's

761
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:04,870
really a broad range of tactics they

762
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,130
were using to push forth

763
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,949
alternate narratives to try and

764
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,150
influence the elections and so if I no

765
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,620
means is something that happens just

766
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,270
here it's a global phenomenon and these

767
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,678
are a lot in many cases its domestic

768
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,629
actors that we have to increasingly be

769
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,419
thinking about what the role might be

770
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,730
and then to even add on to some of the

771
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:23,799
complexity of that you know it's a

772
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,570
growing privatization as well that we're

773
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,158
seeing so just as we're seeing you know

774
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,570
marketplace for hackers for hire we're

775
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,929
seeing a marketplace for basically

776
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:34,629
disinformation and shaping reality for

777
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:36,250
for hire from these firms and so I think

778
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,230
is that the New Yorker had an article in

779
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,450
a sy group which is former Mossad who

780
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,240
are now doing influence campaigns with a

781
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,460
slogan to shape reality and they've

782
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,190
worked they worked on one of them one to

783
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,990
one of their targets was a hospital

784
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,669
board seat in California so this is like

785
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,230
elections at all various whole discreet

786
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:54,490
the most local level which is kind of

787
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,289
crazy

788
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,360
this panel fly dragon campaign that's

789
00:29:56,289 --> 00:30:00,158
something that grafica did that's

790
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,168
Camille's team and looking at some of

791
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,909
that the role of cross-platform spam

792
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:05,470
networks and various kinds of networks

793
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:07,690
that may or may not be attributed to

794
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,220
nation-states and so justice on the

795
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,710
cyber side we have cyber mercenaries

796
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,850
that may or may not be attributed to

797
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,230
nation-state actors same things

798
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,668
happening on just information where you

799
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,870
know the attribution becomes very very

800
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:20,080
difficult as far as whether it's state

801
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,820
connected or not Philippines I think we

802
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,039
know they do tear tay is pretty well

803
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,389
known for you know leading various kinds

804
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:27,820
of disinformation campaigns against its

805
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,710
public in response there has been a the

806
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,689
white troll is pushing back both against

807
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,760
do tear tape but also just put it

808
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,520
pushing out in shaping reality for work

809
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,690
for companies for celebrities so it's a

810
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,668
it's a broad

811
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,929
clientele that a lot of these new

812
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:42,220
companies are using and that's where you

813
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:43,960
get to the disinformation for hire and

814
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,630
so some of the rise of the black PR

815
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,340
firms and so it really makes a

816
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:52,690
complicated landscape that's out there

817
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:54,730
you hope we've now pried something of an

818
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,470
equalizer to show you how broad it is

819
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,940
and what some of the impact can be and

820
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,500
so I think what we'd like to do next is

821
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,659
go into some of the campaigns and

822
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,039
Melanie's going to segue off us some of

823
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,620
this this notion of the privatization in

824
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,870
the disinformation for hire and walk

825
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,870
through a specific example

826
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,990
all right so this is a very beautiful

827
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:26,720
landscape from the Great Barrier Reef

828
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:29,960
and I'm showing this to you for a couple

829
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,940
of seconds take it in because after this

830
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,090
what I'm gonna show you is ugly as sin

831
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,440
so this is the pretty part that I want

832
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:42,939
you to appreciate for the next three

833
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:46,399
seconds so this is a snippet of the

834
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,950
current landscape of advertising

835
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,090
marketing and public relations firms as

836
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:57,980
well as my least favorite which is

837
00:31:53,090 --> 00:32:01,699
influencer marketing but these if you

838
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:04,720
can't see all of the logos it's cuz

839
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,279
there's so many and there are even more

840
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,760
these are our charts that I borrowed

841
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,460
from the internet there is a lot a lot

842
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,590
more and I'm showing you this just so

843
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,139
you can get a sense of all of the

844
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,720
players and all of the actors that are

845
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:23,990
involved in this space how big the

846
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,929
ecosystem is how deep the economic

847
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,909
incentives are for not just platform

848
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:30,500
companies but for all of the companies

849
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:34,370
that are involved in this whether you're

850
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:38,240
the marketer you are the broker there

851
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:41,959
are various degrees of integrity even

852
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,299
with legitimate PR firms suit it is no

853
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,299
wonder that to the average person and

854
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:50,658
the internet feels like this there is no

855
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:56,960
way to get out and you know might feel a

856
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:59,240
little bit uncomfortable and a lot of

857
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,320
that has to do with some of the metrics

858
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:06,470
that the industry is using this image is

859
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,918
I actually really love this image it is

860
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:11,360
from I do a lot of cave diving in Tulum

861
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,789
and so they they have these these

862
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,949
caverns called uh cenotes and this is

863
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:18,850
the image that they put it on the

864
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:21,889
warning sign that you've gone too far so

865
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:23,629
we are at the point where as an industry

866
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:26,809
in marketing advertising and public

867
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:28,129
relations we have gone too far

868
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:31,490
and I believe a lot of that has to do

869
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:33,469
with the common metrics that exist in

870
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:35,090
our industry and I want you to think

871
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,690
about as I go through the next couple of

872
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,970
slides the parallels that this

873
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,450
profession in this group of companies

874
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:46,460
and in industry is going through what

875
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,889
that has in common with those of us in

876
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,169
information security as well it's not

877
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:54,498
like security has really great metrics

878
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:57,639
either right so we're all kind of in

879
00:33:54,499 --> 00:34:00,470
this hand-wavy metrics confusion

880
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:04,369
situation together and that intersection

881
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,899
of information and cyber and the fact

882
00:34:04,369 --> 00:34:07,759
that nobody knows how to measure it

883
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:10,489
effectively in a way that doesn't hurt

884
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:15,230
people is kind of why we're all in this

885
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:17,418
situation together so some of the the

886
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:19,190
more common in really terrible metrics

887
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:23,569
that we have as an industry are things

888
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:25,460
like mentions now mentions is

889
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:27,168
essentially just counting how many times

890
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:30,949
you got quoted or mentioned in a press

891
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:33,138
article I don't know what that means

892
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:35,810
but it is widely used across the

893
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:39,609
industry as something to be proud of and

894
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:42,889
a measurement for a success impressions

895
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:45,649
equally pointless is essentially about

896
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:49,720
the potential audience that could have

897
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:53,210
maybe seen your message so things like

898
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:56,029
subscriber numbers readership numbers of

899
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,670
a publication again I'm not really sure

900
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,380
the value of measuring all of the people

901
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,060
who subscribe to the New York Times

902
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:04,250
versus the people that maybe read the

903
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:07,130
article versus maybe rent the whole

904
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,440
article versus read the article through

905
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,780
to the end saw my comment and actually

906
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,390
formed an opinion about it and then did

907
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:16,670
something so you there's like I said

908
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:19,490
there's a lot of hand waving metrics

909
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:23,119
going on share a voice is really popular

910
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:24,919
with PR firms this is essentially if you

911
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,109
pick a topic or you pick an area of

912
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,490
interest share of voice is a measurement

913
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:32,779
of how much you are you get visibility

914
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:36,348
in that conversation versus other

915
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:40,170
competitors or or peers in the space and

916
00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:42,000
so you can imagine uncertain hot topic

917
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:43,770
for any particular industry they're

918
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,359
gonna be thinking about are we driving

919
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,069
the public narrative or is it being

920
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,869
driven by somebody else that is

921
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:51,869
essentially what this metric is trying

922
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:53,790
to do but again it's it's all based on

923
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:55,380
things like how many times you got

924
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:58,200
mentioned in an article getting

925
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,690
mentioned in an article it is really not

926
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,618
a direct correlation to your influence

927
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:07,049
on the issue engagement is a metric that

928
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:08,730
has come up in recent years be caught

929
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:11,160
particularly because of social media

930
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,380
platforms I also don't know what it

931
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,420
means if somebody retweets you like I

932
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,680
don't know that that justifies my spend

933
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:21,690
in any way but the reason that I have

934
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,480
things like engagement and click-through

935
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,910
is is because there is a lot of focus on

936
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,099
platform companies right now in regards

937
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,500
to misinformation and that's warranted

938
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:34,619
but it's also important to remember who

939
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,740
those platforms customers are and why

940
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:40,140
our platforms like Twitter and Facebook

941
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:42,689
creating platforms where engagement is

942
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,160
the goal and it's because they have a

943
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,690
customer who needs to go to a meeting

944
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,808
tomorrow with an executive and have a

945
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:51,690
number so we've made up numbers that

946
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:52,740
mean nothing but make us feel like we

947
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:57,569
are delivering value to our

948
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:59,790
organizations the last this last metric

949
00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:03,029
advertising value equivalency one of my

950
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:06,890
least favorites it's essentially PR

951
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:10,020
professionals trying to one-up our ad

952
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:13,140
advertising colleagues to say we got

953
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,700
this much visibility for something for a

954
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,540
lot less money than if you would just

955
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,339
purchase an ad or commercial it still

956
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:27,240
doesn't actually lead to any outcomes

957
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:30,599
however and so it's important I think to

958
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,848
also think about there's this shift

959
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:37,049
happening within the industry where it's

960
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:39,150
moving from being an art to maybe be

961
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:42,569
more of a science it's kind of like a

962
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,950
dark science but I do think it's

963
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:45,900
important to note that the industry is

964
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:49,649
trying to mature in terms of

965
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,780
quantitative measurement I think those

966
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,780
of us in cyber security can appreciate

967
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,150
that effort

968
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:58,420
however the root of these metrics are

969
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,580
not they lend themselves to a lot of

970
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:04,630
distrust and a lot of manipulation and

971
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,400
so at the same time they you know these

972
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,220
professions are going into executive

973
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,490
meetings to to you know lay out their

974
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:13,959
numbers what's interesting is that

975
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,240
industry awards the awards that we give

976
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:19,150
ourselves and each other are still

977
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:23,348
focused on the creativeness of the

978
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:25,630
campaign so to me it's a red flag when

979
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:27,490
the way that we are trying to

980
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,440
demonstrate value to our organizations

981
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:33,310
doesn't actually align with how we

982
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,160
ourselves value what we're doing that

983
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:38,650
should cause more of these organizations

984
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:41,140
pause if you're reporting something to

985
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:47,109
your business that is not actually how

986
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:49,029
how you value your profession and so I

987
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:52,450
want to go through one campaign in

988
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:54,130
particular so bell parties are and I'm

989
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,109
using this example because this company

990
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,770
is no longer in business and because I'm

991
00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:02,140
not an idiot

992
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:05,890
so Bell Pottinger is now a out of

993
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:08,700
business british PR firm that got into a

994
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:12,839
lot of hot water

995
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:16,210
mostly post 2016

996
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,089
they were notorious for representing

997
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:22,210
like dictators and repressive regimes

998
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:24,099
and quite honestly celebrities that had

999
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:28,060
been accused of despicable crimes like

1000
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:31,839
murder and in 2016 it came to light that

1001
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:34,029
they had been hired by a group of

1002
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,990
brothers these three billionaires from

1003
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:39,730
india who had very strong economic ties

1004
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:43,060
and empire that they were building in

1005
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,980
south africa and the whole point of this

1006
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:49,240
campaign and the reason why the PR firm

1007
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:52,630
was retained was to create rachel racial

1008
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:56,560
tension in the country in order to

1009
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:58,990
distract media and public attention from

1010
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,170
the crazy corporate things that that

1011
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:05,229
this group was doing in the country and

1012
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:06,010
in less than a year they lost all of

1013
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,720
their clients

1014
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:12,760
they had to fire all of their employees

1015
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,950
and the entire company just went

1016
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,390
underwater the crazy thing is that the

1017
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:20,910
found one of the founders Tim Bell

1018
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:26,640
actually said on the record that

1019
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:31,029
morality is a job for priests not PR men

1020
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:33,670
and so you can think about the problem

1021
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:37,540
that we have as an industry in terms of

1022
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:40,090
information developers sharers

1023
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:43,000
exchangers that there doesn't really

1024
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:46,300
seem to be a sense of morality or

1025
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,800
integrity within either of the

1026
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:53,770
industries that I work in and you know

1027
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,230
and as a result we have there isn't

1028
00:40:53,770 --> 00:41:00,910
really a standard for professional

1029
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:02,980
communication you know agencies or even

1030
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,799
professionals in terms of like we don't

1031
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:08,650
have an accreditation that's mandatory

1032
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,450
we have PRSA which is the public

1033
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,280
relations Society of America we have

1034
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,689
IABC which is the International

1035
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,030
Association of business communicators

1036
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:18,280
each of those do have their own

1037
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,930
accreditation with an ethics standard

1038
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,770
and you can certainly get kicked out of

1039
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:26,589
that group if you violate their code of

1040
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:28,240
conduct but it's not mandatory to be in

1041
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:30,490
that group in order to practice the

1042
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,229
profession and so that makes it

1043
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,069
increasingly difficult to actually

1044
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:37,300
enforce in police any type of

1045
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:41,859
intentional misinformation that's being

1046
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:43,450
spread online and so the last thing that

1047
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:47,230
I want to close with and then we'll move

1048
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:49,810
on to the next campaign is that there

1049
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:52,510
are also a lot of media outlets now that

1050
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:57,730
are actually owned by by some of the

1051
00:41:52,510 --> 00:42:02,109
clients of these various firms advocacy

1052
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:04,660
groups can also get paid to seemingly

1053
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:08,200
represent a certain position within an

1054
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,270
issue so I know this is a challenge for

1055
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,210
advocacy groups to consistently assert

1056
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:14,859
their independence and to make sure that

1057
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,350
you know if you're taking donations or

1058
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:19,098
funding from from any organization that

1059
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:22,130
you're being fully transparent and

1060
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:24,650
that is not affecting your decision as

1061
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:26,180
an organization and so there's just

1062
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,700
there's a lot of things that are coming

1063
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:31,759
together here to actually create this

1064
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:35,629
ecosystem that is just so ripe for

1065
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:37,009
professional lying and I think it's it's

1066
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,710
you know it's one of the reasons why I

1067
00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:41,210
think you know those of us in in the

1068
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,599
security space just need to be really

1069
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:46,130
aware of this or it's really easy to get

1070
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:50,150
caught up in it

1071
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:51,950
please poke your PR teams your marketing

1072
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,799
teams your advertising teams make sure

1073
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,569
that everything is carefully fact check

1074
00:42:53,799 --> 00:43:00,950
call them out on any type of hype or

1075
00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:02,930
 and you know make sure and the

1076
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:05,749
one thing that I will add is make sure

1077
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:08,359
your documentation is really good I will

1078
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,950
tell you the hardest thing for a

1079
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:12,589
communications professional who's

1080
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:16,910
actually trying to seek the truth is an

1081
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:19,190
incomplete fab ticket make sure that

1082
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:21,828
your stuff is is documented that there

1083
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:24,529
is really clear receipts on why

1084
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:26,779
decisions were made why certain paths

1085
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:28,309
were taken even changes to your code

1086
00:43:26,779 --> 00:43:31,190
base all of that needs to be documented

1087
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:32,900
because we will need it in order to make

1088
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:39,160
sure that what we're sharing this is

1089
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,160
accurate and honest thank you

1090
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,630
yeah alright so I'm gonna talk a little

1091
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:53,160
bit about kind of comparative TTP

1092
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:56,130
analysis tactics techniques procedures

1093
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,930
of internet research agency versus the

1094
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:00,599
GRU which is some work that I've done

1095
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,399
over the last three years but more

1096
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,940
broadly at Stanford internet observatory

1097
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,070
we look at everything from forensics of

1098
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,410
attributed campaigns to proactive

1099
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:12,890
detection and working on attribution for

1100
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:16,080
emerging campaigns to policy solutions

1101
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,040
related to and kind of drawn out from

1102
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,140
what we learned in the course of

1103
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,660
understanding those campaigns so we've

1104
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,549
also recently done work on Taiwan Saudi

1105
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:25,589
Arabia and we just announced a Poland

1106
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,040
project so if you want to see what this

1107
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:28,349
looks like

1108
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,180
beyond Russia particularly Saudi Arabia

1109
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:31,830
which actually does hire mercenaries to

1110
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,930
run its campaign's quite regularly I

1111
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:37,710
would definitely encourage you to kind

1112
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,270
of hit up our blog at some point I want

1113
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:41,490
to talk about these two actors which

1114
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:44,070
operated concurrently in the US over a

1115
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,839
multi-year period they operate in fact

1116
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:48,000
globally so they are not limited to the

1117
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,950
US but I'm going to use us examples for

1118
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,220
the purposes of this talk just to kind

1119
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:54,990
of condense it down a bit I want to talk

1120
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:58,259
about it from the standpoint of

1121
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,310
understanding frameworks for how we

1122
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,690
think about propaganda and

1123
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,270
disinformation that's why I think these

1124
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:06,270
two kind of compare and contrast quite

1125
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,770
well so when we talk about the internet

1126
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,210
research agency and this is the thing

1127
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,490
that has kind of really dominated a

1128
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,730
conversation on influence operations and

1129
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:17,220
disinformation campaigns over the last

1130
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:19,140
almost four years now three years the

1131
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,089
IRA should be understood as mimetic

1132
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,819
propaganda and a form of social

1133
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:26,790
manipulation so the content produced was

1134
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:28,349
largely memes memes are units of

1135
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,420
cultural capital we think of them as

1136
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:32,220
kind of like the cat picture but they're

1137
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,859
actually intended to be kind of a remix

1138
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,649
culture like a block a gene in fact of

1139
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:39,299
remix culture that is that spreads from

1140
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,520
person to person they're deliberately

1141
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,430
they are intended to be shared that is

1142
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,960
the entire point the entire point is of

1143
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,940
course to create something that really

1144
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,410
communicates a message to the in-group

1145
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,410
and very few words

1146
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:54,060
very discreet you can't hold a complexed

1147
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,690
nuanced conversation and a meme you're

1148
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,849
going to get six words

1149
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:59,170
but as long as it is well targeted as

1150
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:01,059
long as it makes people feel a certain

1151
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,680
way it's emotionally evocative the

1152
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:04,630
prompt is for them to continue to share

1153
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,220
it and in doing so they continue to

1154
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,260
spread the message and one thing that

1155
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,730
the IRA was particularly good at was

1156
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:12,069
they branded all of their content so

1157
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:14,109
angry Eagle was one of their Instagram

1158
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:16,000
accounts it really targeted young

1159
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:18,220
conservatives there is a degree of

1160
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,809
audience segmentation and sophistication

1161
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,609
that sometimes gets glossed over in the

1162
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:24,700
media the extent to which they

1163
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:26,710
understood exactly what subset what sub

1164
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:28,328
segments even of a particular audience

1165
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:31,599
they were talking to is actually quite

1166
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:33,730
remarkable and so angry eagle targeted

1167
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,410
very young conservatives this kind of

1168
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:39,390
content they did not create this meme

1169
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:41,950
this meme actually came from it's been

1170
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:43,029
possibly attributed to turning-point USA

1171
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:44,919
we've seen a couple others that were

1172
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:46,119
attributed to turning-point USA but it

1173
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,819
moved around through kind of like the

1174
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:51,309
alt-right young conservative cluster

1175
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:55,240
that was active on the Internet in the

1176
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:56,890
kind of 2015 to 2017 timeframe this was

1177
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,328
distinctly different than the kind of

1178
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:00,339
older conservative content they were

1179
00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:02,230
producing with a lot of American flags

1180
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:04,240
on Ronald Reagan so there were age

1181
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,920
segmentations there were interest

1182
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,660
segmentations they weren't just

1183
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,700
producing quote-unquote conservative

1184
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:12,788
content they had an understanding of how

1185
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:14,680
to target unto whom they did a really

1186
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:16,000
good job of understanding mimetics from

1187
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,009
the standpoint of grabbing something

1188
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,279
that had some resonance elsewhere and

1189
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:23,200
then repurposing it so this meme about

1190
00:47:21,279 --> 00:47:25,420
amnesty which is a big topic of

1191
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,009
conversation during the election but

1192
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,380
also important to note most of this

1193
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,510
content was active from about 2014

1194
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,339
through 2017 so the election happened

1195
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:34,930
during that time but this was a long

1196
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:37,000
term operation that was happening and

1197
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,440
social issues were the vast majority of

1198
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,270
the kind of content that was being put

1199
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,180
out the political content was actually

1200
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:44,829
around just made 10% or so of candidate

1201
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,270
mentions so what they were doing was

1202
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:48,549
they were leaning into these issues that

1203
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:51,400
were hot-button issues in the American

1204
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:53,559
political and social conversation they

1205
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,589
actually grabbed this particular image

1206
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:59,140
was traced back we traced it back to in

1207
00:47:56,589 --> 00:48:00,069
2014 somebody posting it on a message

1208
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,109
board

1209
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:03,880
so even but this was not actually

1210
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:05,710
originally social network native

1211
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,660
conversation this came just from a

1212
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,950
message board and then it was pushed

1213
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,859
onto Facebook and rebrand

1214
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,839
by them in a number of different ways

1215
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:15,520
they operate to some extent like a

1216
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,500
marketing agency and so oftentimes

1217
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,480
you'll hear them referred to as like the

1218
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,030
troll farm the kind of troll marketing

1219
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:24,310
agency one of the things that was really

1220
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,260
interesting was when we had the data set

1221
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:30,160
their army of Jesus account which is

1222
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:33,250
quite it was quite um quite popular tons

1223
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,660
and tons of engagements what we saw from

1224
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:37,180
that was actually it started out as a

1225
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:39,009
Kermit the Frog meme page so they were

1226
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,169
trying a lot of different kind of

1227
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:42,760
American cultural iconography what could

1228
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,650
they use to speak to people what would

1229
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,570
grow an audience and so you see them

1230
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,849
really trying so many different things

1231
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:51,430
and using metrics engagement metrics in

1232
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:53,829
particular to see what sticks and so

1233
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:55,960
they actually evolved this before him

1234
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:58,030
before the page found Jesus it was a

1235
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,619
Kermit the Frog main page and then when

1236
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,540
they decided that Kermit wasn't hitting

1237
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:04,119
as well they moved it to be a Simpsons

1238
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,680
meme page and then all of a sudden like

1239
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:09,070
I said it finds Jesus and all of a

1240
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,020
sudden the content is 100% you know it

1241
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,670
was a about a hundred you know 100

1242
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,770
percent Jesus but with like 10 percent

1243
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:17,800
of and also Jesus hates Hilary kind of

1244
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:20,940
like stuck in there so that's how again

1245
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:23,650
in a sort of standard like canonical

1246
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:26,200
1960s propaganda tactics that are just

1247
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:28,000
deployed for the Internet age the idea

1248
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,649
of like in order for propaganda to work

1249
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,180
it has to be immersive and so they are

1250
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:33,250
trying constantly to create this

1251
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,529
immersive environment it's not the idea

1252
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,730
of propaganda as touch which I think is

1253
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:39,069
how some people particularly in the

1254
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,720
media reported out it's not that if you

1255
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:42,310
saw one meme your heart or mind would be

1256
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,689
changed it's that you're put into these

1257
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:48,670
immersive environments the memes are

1258
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,099
repeated across pages so again they had

1259
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:52,810
some idea of what their winners were and

1260
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:54,609
when they found winners they spread it

1261
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,650
to as many of their accounts as possible

1262
00:49:54,609 --> 00:49:59,109
again these were the ones these were

1263
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:01,569
ones that were particularly engaging for

1264
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:03,430
their audience oh and you can see the

1265
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:05,560
kind of the turning point icon up there

1266
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:07,299
on the top which has been removed and

1267
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,759
replaced with their rebrand down there

1268
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,710
on the bottom and further Rand Paul meme

1269
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,329
and the point of that of course is you

1270
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:14,800
see this content it's branded stop all

1271
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:16,420
invaders you think wow I really like

1272
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,500
this stop all invaders content let me go

1273
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,550
follow them on Instagram so we see some

1274
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,210
of the content these were some of the

1275
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:25,089
most popular

1276
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,920
again engagements is not impact in the

1277
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:29,259
sense of when we gauge did this change a

1278
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:30,940
heart or mind we can't really make that

1279
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,010
assumption baby we can't make that

1280
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,839
determination based on the data that

1281
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:37,150
that I was given which didn't include

1282
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:40,029
comment data but what we can see is that

1283
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:41,950
these things were liked shared commented

1284
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:43,630
on hundreds of thousands close to a

1285
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:47,140
million in this case with the Yosemite

1286
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:48,910
Sam Times so we do try to understand and

1287
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:52,420
contextualize these things relative to

1288
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:54,910
stuff like crowd tangle stats for

1289
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:57,070
similar types of content at the same

1290
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,140
time it's not a direct parallel but we

1291
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:00,400
do try to understand where it fell and

1292
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,740
we could see that some of the

1293
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,300
conservative pages and one or two of the

1294
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,549
black community targeted Instagram

1295
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:09,280
accounts did perform very well even

1296
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:12,700
relative to authentic America in

1297
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:17,770
American produced similar media at the

1298
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:19,330
time once you have people following one

1299
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,580
or two of your pages that's where you

1300
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:23,319
start to see the networking to create

1301
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,690
that immersive environment that kind of

1302
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,670
once your following one of their pages

1303
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,710
the whole point is to recruit you into

1304
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:32,140
the the sort of broader media ecosystem

1305
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:34,510
I apologize this is a lot fuzzier up

1306
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:37,150
there than it is on mine but what we

1307
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:39,099
looked at is the ways in which if you

1308
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:41,140
can see the different colors the red

1309
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:43,750
dots are internet research agency

1310
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,640
accounts and the blue dots are real

1311
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:47,740
community media accounts that they

1312
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:51,220
mentioned and so you it's this is on

1313
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:54,250
Instagram so what you would see is you

1314
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:56,919
would see them shouting out or reposting

1315
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:59,170
or regram this content from real

1316
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,790
community media which in turn through

1317
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:04,359
you know kind of spirit of reciprocity

1318
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:05,710
would do it back to them and so by doing

1319
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:08,109
this they really integrate themselves

1320
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:10,270
into most effectively in the black

1321
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:11,529
community but again also in the in

1322
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:13,480
certain parts of the conservative

1323
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:17,800
community you can see up there at the

1324
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:20,890
top the extremely kind of loosely linked

1325
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:23,170
ones that was their feminism and general

1326
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,270
kind of left-leaning stuff it was really

1327
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,730
very significantly underdeveloped

1328
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:30,339
relative to the black community and the

1329
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:33,190
conservative community they went after

1330
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:34,839
some social issues there feminism page

1331
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,710
was mostly like these kind of like it

1332
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:37,540
was literally they were

1333
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:42,040
cribbing from a t-shirt company that

1334
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:43,810
made like platitude t-shirts so so many

1335
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,220
times actually that when I saw the

1336
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,049
mentions I actually wondered if that

1337
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,000
t-shirt company was an Internet research

1338
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:53,050
agency account and I sent a DM and I'm

1339
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,490
like hey so like where would I go to buy

1340
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:57,339
your products if they hypothetically

1341
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:59,098
existed you know and their customer

1342
00:52:57,339 --> 00:53:02,200
service person actually did write back

1343
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:04,510
so but it was again it's an example of

1344
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,460
like so much repurposing of that content

1345
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:09,210
so much incorporation until like the

1346
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:12,280
sort of real community media the real

1347
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:14,560
stuff that you it was very hard at times

1348
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,660
to figure out what was theirs and what

1349
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,700
wasn't and so even though we had been

1350
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,080
given the pages and these accounts as

1351
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,580
attributed by the companies of course

1352
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,680
sometimes the companies miss one or miss

1353
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,240
a tribute so we did do a lot of digging

1354
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:30,310
into trying to understand which of those

1355
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:32,439
other ones were in fact real but what

1356
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:34,690
comes next is actually this kind of

1357
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,310
recruitment of the unwitting and this is

1358
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,900
where it gets out of the realm of social

1359
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:40,060
media and this is where when we talk

1360
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,730
about things like impact we look to

1361
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:46,180
understand how they turned real people

1362
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:48,280
into inadvertent unwitting you know the

1363
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:51,580
phrasing kind of Soviet times was useful

1364
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:54,580
idiot but the people who become

1365
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:56,710
unwittingly a part of the operation and

1366
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,630
they do that by encouraging them to

1367
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:01,330
participate in the community so again

1368
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:03,820
the propaganda is never phrased as like

1369
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,680
you should do something it's always we

1370
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,480
need to as members of the black

1371
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,549
community we shouldn't vote for Hillary

1372
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,220
so it's always framed as something that

1373
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:14,140
like draws you in reinforces you in your

1374
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,009
identity and that's the mechanism by

1375
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,598
which it operates

1376
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:18,130
and then as a member of that community

1377
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:19,630
of course you want to advance the

1378
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,250
interests of that community of course

1379
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,780
you want to help them and so you're

1380
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:24,880
going to show up to the protest and take

1381
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,900
video which you're going to DM back to

1382
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,240
them and then they're going to use that

1383
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,339
in their next propaganda campaign with

1384
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,290
on the street video of unrest in the

1385
00:54:30,339 --> 00:54:34,960
streets of America and that was how they

1386
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:38,589
were carrying out the sort of real world

1387
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:42,550
aspect of this and then my favorite part

1388
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:43,690
of the content was actually them posting

1389
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:45,369
particularly in the conservative

1390
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,760
community clusters about how they didn't

1391
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:49,850
exist

1392
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,410
so this was during 2017 when people were

1393
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:53,029
beginning to talk about whether there

1394
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:55,160
had been a Russian influence operation

1395
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:56,690
and beginning to try to understand what

1396
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,089
had happened on Facebook and that's when

1397
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:00,740
these memes were coming out you know

1398
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,720
mommy there are monsters on the red it's

1399
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,870
probably just the Russians right and so

1400
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:07,189
that's where you start to see them

1401
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:08,600
diminishing and turning it into a joke

1402
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:11,000
the very idea that Russia would have

1403
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,799
interfered again producing content and

1404
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,090
propaganda for the audience that was

1405
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,590
most likely to believe that so then we

1406
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:20,330
look at a very different type of

1407
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:25,640
operation that was actually happening at

1408
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:26,750
the same time so the GRU Russian

1409
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,850
military intelligence

1410
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,380
so one thing I'll say when we talk about

1411
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:32,630
like mercenary organizations and things

1412
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:34,310
the internet research agency is not an

1413
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:36,530
arm of the Russian government it is

1414
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:38,240
owned by a Russian oligarch but that

1415
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:40,940
provides an extent of plausible

1416
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,859
deniability that as Putin has said these

1417
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,360
are just some patriotic trolls god only

1418
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:47,420
knows what they're doing we certainly

1419
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,610
didn't tell them to do anything the GRU

1420
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,620
is Russian military intelligence that

1421
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:54,740
plausible deniability does not exist it

1422
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,970
is controlled by the Kremlin so we have

1423
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,410
an interesting situation here where you

1424
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:59,359
have the plausible deniability and

1425
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:02,660
mimetic social stuff happening on one

1426
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,600
hand and then simultaneously you begin

1427
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:07,700
to see this was from a page trying to

1428
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,230
paint us opposition to the Russian

1429
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,779
invasion of Crimea as like rank

1430
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:13,100
hypocrisy because of course the US had

1431
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:15,380
invaded so many countries in the past

1432
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:19,490
but what was interesting about it was

1433
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:23,060
where the IRA was all like social means

1434
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:25,279
what you see from the GRU is really it's

1435
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:27,590
like strong geopolitically focused

1436
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,920
activity so kind of a significant level

1437
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:32,870
up in terms of the kind of type of

1438
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:36,020
content and the degree of sophistication

1439
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:37,250
to even understand the mimetics that

1440
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,960
they were going for like a strong sense

1441
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:42,860
of history and things like that but

1442
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:45,620
ultimately their memes failed so as a

1443
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:47,990
social influence operation on the left

1444
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:50,569
or the Facebook pages that I was given

1445
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:53,569
and you can see on the right total

1446
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,670
engagement total engagement across all

1447
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,990
of these pages which spanned a period of

1448
00:56:55,670 --> 00:57:01,330
literally years

1449
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:04,339
ranging from 2012 to 2018 late 2018 was

1450
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,840
14,000 so if you've ever run a Facebook

1451
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:08,000
page or run a marketing campaign you

1452
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,080
know that that is like abysmal that like

1453
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,900
with like a couple hundred bucks you

1454
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,799
should be able to do better than that

1455
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,030
contrast that with the internet research

1456
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,400
agency which was about a hundred and

1457
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,930
sixty seven million engagements so even

1458
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,060
though engagements are not a proxy for

1459
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,470
impact when we look at these operations

1460
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:24,619
kind of side by side one of the things

1461
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:26,359
that we see is this glaring realization

1462
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:28,760
that half of these posts didn't even get

1463
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:32,540
a single comment so why were they even

1464
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:34,340
bothering and so this is where we look

1465
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:39,050
at what they were doing right and and so

1466
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:42,320
I spent about probably nine months the

1467
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:44,420
internet the IRA dataset was about four

1468
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,220
hundred gigs of material provided by the

1469
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:48,410
platforms attributed by the platform's

1470
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,660
the GRU data set was a collection of

1471
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:53,270
folders with some PDFs in them from

1472
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:58,009
Facebook that was basically the name of

1473
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:59,360
the page the posts PDFs and then we had

1474
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:01,220
to do the work of figuring out what it

1475
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,330
was so this was actually a very

1476
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,220
interesting open source intelligence

1477
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:06,230
project for about eight or nine months

1478
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,700
trying to track where this content

1479
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,920
appeared elsewhere on the Internet to

1480
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,319
understand it in the broader holistic

1481
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,540
information environment space not as a

1482
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,609
social influence operation at all but as

1483
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:18,290
narrative propaganda and what began to

1484
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:20,330
emerge was a picture of media

1485
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:22,160
manipulation instead so rather than

1486
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,440
going peer-to-peer and trying to produce

1487
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,540
content that you yourself want to share

1488
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,960
what you see instead a significant

1489
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:31,340
narrative long form pushing a particular

1490
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,310
geopolitical version a particular

1491
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:37,970
particular state aligned point of view

1492
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:40,520
on geopolitical activities and the way

1493
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:44,660
that they did that was by creating first

1494
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:47,780
these kind of front authority figures we

1495
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:50,259
called them like Potemkin pages from the

1496
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:52,400
Potemkin village which is kind of a

1497
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,350
maybe an obscure cultural reference I

1498
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,500
won't go into it now but this was a page

1499
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:59,660
called inside Syria and media center

1500
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:01,850
inside Syrian media center purported to

1501
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,529
be a news organization a media

1502
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:05,930
organization with about eight or nine

1503
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:09,070
reporters operating to tell the the true

1504
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:10,370
truth of the of the Syrian conflict and

1505
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:12,500
so

1506
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:17,540
what they did was they created these

1507
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:21,140
this very legitimate seeming extremely

1508
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:22,880
high volume kind of looked like a news

1509
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,460
agency that was reporting out constantly

1510
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,620
on what was happening in Syria and in

1511
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:32,900
the course of doing that they created a

1512
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:35,180
series of personas in my slide here this

1513
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,400
is actually I probably should have done

1514
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,839
this slightly differently not the inside

1515
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,090
Syria Media Center reporter but I

1516
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,220
grabbed this guy because he's nice and

1517
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:45,710
kind of distilled down this is a persona

1518
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:48,439
named Andrew Cole kovitch Andrew Cole

1519
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:49,880
kovitch is the first persona that we

1520
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,160
were able to find this is the oldest

1521
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,590
this was like kind of v1 Andrew Cole

1522
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,399
Kovich was a quote-unquote reporter or

1523
00:59:54,590 --> 01:00:00,020
contributor for this site news Land as a

1524
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,220
anyone can contribute kind of site but

1525
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:02,750
what andrew cole kovitch was writing

1526
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:05,779
about was how the US should continue to

1527
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:07,250
hate japan and why should the US

1528
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,050
continue to hate Japan well it turns out

1529
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,580
Japan and Russia were involved in a

1530
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:13,130
territorial dispute about the Kuril

1531
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:14,480
Islands this apparently is a territorial

1532
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:16,340
dispute that as I learned has gone

1533
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:22,550
unresolved since World War two this is a

1534
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:24,560
very old gripe but here in 2012 we see

1535
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:27,050
them beginning to push this this kind of

1536
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,190
gripe out on to social media and so we

1537
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:30,110
have the guy answer

1538
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:32,840
asking and answering questions on Quora

1539
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:34,610
he claims to be a University of Oregon

1540
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,070
employee he has a Twitter account he's

1541
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:39,100
got a Facebook page stub profile really

1542
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:42,920
poorly done again the Twitter account

1543
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:44,839
meaningless you know hands iconography

1544
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,980
no banner no nothing but he's tweeting

1545
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:50,570
out his own his own writing and as we

1546
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,890
start to map our understanding of how

1547
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:54,380
Andrew Cole kovitch fits into this

1548
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,730
operation again this is persona number

1549
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:58,340
one this is the oldest one that we have

1550
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:59,990
evidence of we begin to see that there's

1551
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,970
a face suit on the left or the Facebook

1552
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,979
pages so there's Andrew Cole kovitch

1553
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:05,750
true to life which was his Facebook page

1554
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,730
made kind of to be a fan page for his

1555
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:10,190
writing then there's the destiny of

1556
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:12,050
Russian curl Islands which is their page

1557
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,270
where they're griping about who owns the

1558
01:01:12,050 --> 01:01:16,850
curl islands and of course Andrew Kovac

1559
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,710
is authoring content and the destiny of

1560
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:20,440
the Russian curl islands is sharing his

1561
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:22,990
content and so this is

1562
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,640
brought together the pages grabbing

1563
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:26,529
articles from the internet andrew cole

1564
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,839
Kovach's writing the articles on the

1565
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:30,910
internet and been a group is a fake

1566
01:01:28,839 --> 01:01:32,859
think-tank they begin to stand up not

1567
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:34,980
only fake media organizations but fake

1568
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:37,060
think tanks and that's because these are

1569
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,430
organizations that we treat a sort of

1570
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:41,290
authoritative sources our inclination is

1571
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:42,640
not to think well that think-tank must

1572
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:44,980
be fake or a front of Russian military

1573
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,359
intelligence our inclination is to think

1574
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:49,060
even if we don't agree with the point of

1575
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:51,009
view there is likely some legitimacy and

1576
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:53,349
the value of this is when someone is

1577
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:56,050
writing going back to inside Syria Media

1578
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:57,700
Center we would see RT & Sputnik doing

1579
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:00,210
things like saying according to the

1580
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:03,220
experts at inside Syria Media Center ,

1581
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:05,109
and so they're able to use their fronts

1582
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:07,060
use their personas to create this

1583
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:09,250
perception of authority that this is the

1584
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:12,310
point of view on this geopolitical event

1585
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:14,349
that you should take seriously so Andrew

1586
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:16,000
Cole kovitch is sharing content from and

1587
01:02:14,349 --> 01:02:17,829
been a group even though he didn't write

1588
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,079
for it so they used each of their

1589
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:24,010
personas as producers as well as

1590
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:26,560
amplifiers of content so again sorry you

1591
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:29,109
can't see the lines here but what we did

1592
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,990
was we mapped our we identified a

1593
01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:33,578
collection of fake personas and then

1594
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:37,868
began to look to understand to what

1595
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:40,420
extent these personas produced content

1596
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:41,859
and where that content wound up and what

1597
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,079
we saw is that each of these personas

1598
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:45,670
Sophie Mangal and Alice Donovan are the

1599
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,099
two that were actually exposed by the

1600
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:51,190
FBI and then a number of articles about

1601
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:53,890
them were written so those two appeared

1602
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:55,660
in our dataset and alongside them as we

1603
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:57,069
were going through this data and tracing

1604
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,779
back you know kind of like through

1605
01:02:57,069 --> 01:03:00,490
archives and everything else where this

1606
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,440
content appeared you can see that each

1607
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:04,629
of these personas had a unique kind of

1608
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:07,150
political point of view or regional

1609
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:08,710
focus and then they also all contributed

1610
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:12,730
content to what we would call the kind

1611
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:15,250
of mainstream main streams not main I

1612
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:16,630
guess independent media ecosystem in the

1613
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,849
United States and that's where you see

1614
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:21,760
like global research counterpunch

1615
01:03:18,849 --> 01:03:25,060
veterans today these sorts of pages that

1616
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,920
are seen as being an alternative to the

1617
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:29,828
mainstream media but have large

1618
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:31,690
followings themselves so even though

1619
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:33,970
maybe the zoom in will help a little bit

1620
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,340
even though they are fail

1621
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:39,220
at getting social engagements on their

1622
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:41,349
own pages when they write the article

1623
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,839
and contribute it to veterans today add

1624
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:46,119
veterans today shares it to their page

1625
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:47,680
that's where you see the engagement come

1626
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:49,359
in so that's where you'll see five

1627
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:51,759
million engagements five million views

1628
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:53,500
you know that's where you'll see the

1629
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,500
real engagement will come through the

1630
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:59,050
laundering process at the end point if

1631
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,490
that makes sense as opposed to on the

1632
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:03,190
stub Facebook page or profile that

1633
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:04,839
they've created for themselves and then

1634
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:09,099
they use these amplifying accounts to

1635
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:10,840
kind of push stuff out in the into pages

1636
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:14,460
and groups and that's where we start to

1637
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:17,800
see a little bit of that kind of the

1638
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:20,560
pushing into those closed communities so

1639
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:23,859
this is where the spearfishing and the

1640
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:26,170
hacking leaked activity is done in part

1641
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:28,598
in service to having these sorts of

1642
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:30,150
narratives that then can be picked up by

1643
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:37,510
the media laundered through the media

1644
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:39,460
and then move towards getting into the

1645
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:41,260
the kind of a canonical example here

1646
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,760
would be like DC leaks they go they do

1647
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:44,950
the hack they try to push it out on

1648
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,980
social they fail on social they give it

1649
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:49,750
to WikiLeaks they give it to media media

1650
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,640
then begins to write the story and each

1651
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:53,410
time they release a tranche of documents

1652
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,940
they control the media narrative so

1653
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:57,250
again we see this media manipulation

1654
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:59,080
this narrative first operation that the

1655
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:01,359
goal is not to have social the goal is

1656
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:03,400
really to to run things through this

1657
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:05,650
entire other channel and that's why

1658
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,970
they're operating simultaneously but

1659
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:10,300
they're running two completely different

1660
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:13,118
strategies so just in closing I think

1661
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,859
this is where we look at detection is a

1662
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,359
challenge and algorithms

1663
01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:17,920
asari detection is a challenge and

1664
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:19,810
attribution is getting a lot harder so

1665
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,240
as we do this research as we try to

1666
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:23,950
understand operational frameworks for

1667
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,410
these things we actually do draw a lot

1668
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:28,299
on cybersecurity methodologies thinking

1669
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:29,770
about staging thinking about attribution

1670
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,990
thinking about ways to kind of

1671
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:34,030
collaborate and understand sort of

1672
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:35,439
persistent threat actors in the form of

1673
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,400
state actors in the information space

1674
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,400
Thanks

1675
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:47,350
okay we have a little over ten minutes

1676
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,430
left to go and so I do this are getting

1677
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:51,460
people if they have questions to start

1678
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:53,740
lining up and before that are while

1679
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:55,480
we're waiting for that it would have

1680
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:58,359
questions so want to quickly go into

1681
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,310
we've heard a lot about you know this

1682
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,790
isn't new disinformation propaganda all

1683
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:04,660
this trying to shape reality is not new

1684
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:05,650
one of things that we are dealing with a

1685
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,149
lot that right now is that the

1686
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:08,980
algorithms and propagation are

1687
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:10,900
escalating it they're allowing might

1688
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,850
very micro targeting the subsets of

1689
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,750
populations and widespread reach now

1690
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:16,480
just looking you know quickly through

1691
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:18,760
some of the Regents going on right now

1692
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:21,130
Australian walk in a wildfire is the

1693
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,190
anti-boycott Amazon

1694
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,900
that's oregano oil which apparently some

1695
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:27,940
reporting is a cure for coronavirus so

1696
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,770
it's really it's hitting all aspects of

1697
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,450
every current event going on right now

1698
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,710
and so just wanna keep that in mind and

1699
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:34,180
there's many different ways that the

1700
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:36,250
algorithms are being here they're being

1701
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:37,960
gamed there's astroturfing

1702
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,369
we're having you the micro targeting the

1703
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,990
ads and some of the platforms are

1704
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:42,640
responding and turn to that they're also

1705
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:44,200
algorithms that are determining where

1706
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,609
companies are financing and some of

1707
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,660
those determinations are actually

1708
01:06:45,609 --> 01:06:49,390
funding some of the state-run propaganda

1709
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:51,310
sites and so they've been some recent

1710
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:52,720
articles on that worried about Geico

1711
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:55,960
Amazon Walmart and big companies are

1712
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:56,890
funding a ort unknowingly because that's

1713
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,300
where the algorithms are sending them

1714
01:06:56,890 --> 01:07:00,339
and so there's lots going on there game

1715
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:02,140
we're more complicated with a deep fakes

1716
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,250
voice mimicry read fixed it's it's an

1717
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,660
evolving landscape that's going to

1718
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:06,700
become more complex but the nice thing

1719
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,290
about this also units it's a dual use

1720
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,730
technology and so we also can leverage

1721
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:12,580
some the technology for the solutions as

1722
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:13,600
well and so I think the questions were

1723
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,340
probably it into some of the solutions

1724
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,720
as well but I think all its here look at

1725
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:19,510
it as means company a combination of the

1726
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,830
the legal the social the technical all

1727
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:24,220
aspects of our community of coming

1728
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:25,840
together to try and address this so with

1729
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:27,790
that I think would save some time right

1730
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:31,020
now for Q&A I guess start over here

1731
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:33,759
Michael oh man kazoo i was wondering how

1732
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:36,220
effective the use of

1733
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:39,089
the graft techniques can be in

1734
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:42,549
determining which accounts are false or

1735
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:48,940
otherwise fronting like share that sort

1736
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:51,940
of thing compared to a real user so we

1737
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:57,819
use that we do we'll map a network and

1738
01:07:51,940 --> 01:08:00,040
then things that look to only be

1739
01:07:57,819 --> 01:08:01,599
involved in a particular operation like

1740
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,040
they have no back story and no back

1741
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,720
accounts when you look at the tweets you

1742
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,270
see the language change that was one of

1743
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,980
the things we saw with China it's

1744
01:08:07,270 --> 01:08:11,710
usually intended to be a flag for an

1745
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:14,619
analyst so then go do further work so we

1746
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:16,839
don't rely on things like bot assessment

1747
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:19,350
scores at this point we just don't think

1748
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:22,089
they're very reliable a lot of the time

1749
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:23,739
we do work in conjunction with the

1750
01:08:22,089 --> 01:08:25,089
platforms as well so when we see things

1751
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:26,678
that are anomalous one of the things

1752
01:08:25,089 --> 01:08:28,359
that we'll do is we'll actually flag it

1753
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:29,859
and communicate with somebody on

1754
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:32,259
Twitter's integrity team and say this is

1755
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:33,489
where we think anomalous behavior is

1756
01:08:32,259 --> 01:08:35,080
occurring here's how we would describe

1757
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:38,068
it here's how here's our kind of

1758
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,089
confidence level in a potential

1759
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:42,880
attribution or what we think it might be

1760
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:44,979
here's why what do you think and so we

1761
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,620
do have that we've been working pretty

1762
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:49,299
hard on building relationships - to

1763
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:51,460
ensure better attribution and better

1764
01:08:49,299 --> 01:08:52,750
identification yeah I don't think it's

1765
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:57,600
something that you can do wholly on your

1766
01:08:52,750 --> 01:09:00,969
own on the outside anymore Thanks I

1767
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:03,969
wanted to ask briefly the panel's

1768
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:05,560
opinion on some points made by Neal

1769
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:09,549
Stephenson the sci-fi author he just

1770
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:11,969
published a book on this topic and like

1771
01:09:09,549 --> 01:09:14,528
a hundred I'm sorry - 50 years from now

1772
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:15,609
all of the disinformation topics that

1773
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:18,160
you've been talking about are like a

1774
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:20,049
hundred times worse and he makes three

1775
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,460
points one is that if you're a person

1776
01:09:20,049 --> 01:09:23,679
who's trying to spread the truth you

1777
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:25,149
have to weaponize these tools and that's

1778
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,910
the only kind of defense that's going to

1779
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:29,379
exist and that access to truth is a

1780
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,120
privilege of the upper class and the

1781
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,469
third point is that these bespoke

1782
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,028
realities that you talked about are

1783
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:35,500
going to become the norm and they're

1784
01:09:34,029 --> 01:09:37,540
just just whole populations that we're

1785
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:41,529
going to lose so I wonder if you all

1786
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:46,179
could speak to some of those projections

1787
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:47,350
I mean I'll start and I'll just start by

1788
01:09:46,179 --> 01:09:49,410
saying

1789
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:52,960
I don't see current reality is

1790
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:55,210
particularly much different than what I

1791
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,030
have seen throughout my entire career I

1792
01:09:55,210 --> 01:10:00,340
do think I think because I come from

1793
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:03,070
that background of like I I know how the

1794
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:06,550
legitimate businesses or I mean

1795
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:08,290
legitimate businesses you know like

1796
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:11,650
trying to manipulate people with

1797
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:13,540
information is not a new concept and

1798
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:18,519
what I what I think we're seeing I mean

1799
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:20,410
we saw the trend first in like marketing

1800
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,540
and advertising in PR where it was all

1801
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:24,130
of a sudden now we we have the Internet

1802
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:26,230
and there were all of these talks and

1803
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:28,630
all these blog posts about oh my god PR

1804
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:31,750
is changing because of the internet it

1805
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:36,070
didn't in terms of the fundamental

1806
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:38,530
objectives what changed was was the

1807
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:40,719
tools that were available to us and the

1808
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:42,280
ability I think Rene pointing this out

1809
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,410
very well the ability to have more

1810
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:47,440
integrated campaigns across different

1811
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:51,580
types of platforms and in formats but I

1812
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:54,759
personally if it gets worse I think I

1813
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:56,170
will it will look like this because they

1814
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,090
just think it's a problem that's existed

1815
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:03,520
for so long and what we're talking about

1816
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:11,860
now is tools rather than a a new measure

1817
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:13,780
of human nature all right Colin Chisholm

1818
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:15,849
zero technologies it seems that one of

1819
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:17,889
the major actors in this entire sort of

1820
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:21,130
ecosystem of misinformation are the

1821
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:23,050
individuals who are engaging or are

1822
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:24,640
propagating you know the content that's

1823
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:28,120
being generated has there been any

1824
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:32,440
research done to identify the the

1825
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:34,420
demographics of people who are more more

1826
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:37,089
active in that or is it really just

1827
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:42,430
everybody in every social media platform

1828
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:44,530
it's just InfoSec on twitter there's a

1829
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:46,180
couple of academic papers that have come

1830
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:48,190
out recently one on Twitter and I think

1831
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:50,740
one on Facebook looking at the

1832
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:54,700
prevalence of older people actually who

1833
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:58,420
are not digital natives and seem to have

1834
01:11:54,700 --> 01:12:00,340
a seem to be challenged by not looking

1835
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,150
at the domain that created the content

1836
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,409
that they're sharing

1837
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:05,379
thinking that all news is kind of

1838
01:12:02,409 --> 01:12:07,000
equivalent news and so even looking at

1839
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:08,260
things you know Tristan Harris and other

1840
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,210
people have done work on what are the

1841
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:12,850
design well what are the ramifications

1842
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:15,550
of design and kind of like Facebook kind

1843
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:18,340
of stripping out branding and just all

1844
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:20,110
media looks identical and so there has

1845
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:22,300
been some some work done looking at that

1846
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:26,710
what we saw though with with the IRA

1847
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:28,480
engagement data again their left-leaning

1848
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,890
kind of the feminist d-type content was

1849
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,570
just bad it just wasn't very

1850
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:33,250
sophisticated it wasn't very good the

1851
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:36,790
content that was better the content

1852
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:38,890
particularly the race divisive nity

1853
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:41,650
content and then the kind of Confederacy

1854
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:42,670
type communities the engagement was very

1855
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:45,250
high and we couldn't see the

1856
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:46,960
demographics of the people in it but

1857
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,610
judging by the fact that the content was

1858
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,440
targeting younger people and some of the

1859
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:54,000
early ad campaigns were targeting

1860
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:56,139
different age ranges starting at 18

1861
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,830
people of all types engage with this

1862
01:12:56,140 --> 01:13:01,810
stuff thank you over there

1863
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:04,330
should have found similar G from Google

1864
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:06,640
both Melanie and Rene talked about

1865
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:08,110
motivations but the one motivation area

1866
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,050
that I'm still struggling with that I

1867
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:12,969
didn't hear covered much as sort of the

1868
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:15,010
apparent nihilism or in some cases this

1869
01:13:12,969 --> 01:13:16,390
sort of stochastic terrorism of some of

1870
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:19,239
these campaigns where it's not entirely

1871
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:20,530
clear exactly what they're chasing

1872
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:21,580
they're putting a lot of energy into it

1873
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,750
and they're creating an awful lot of

1874
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:27,940
discord and dissonance

1875
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:31,000
but the ultimate outcome seems decidedly

1876
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:34,120
unclear and I was curious if either of

1877
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,250
you had sort of a take on that are they

1878
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:38,710
just chasing engagement is this just a

1879
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:42,580
form of particularly malevolent a be

1880
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:44,590
testing like how how do these almost

1881
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:48,250
nihilistic campaigns what's the outcome

1882
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:50,020
at the far end um I can start I think

1883
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:53,620
you probably know more than I do on this

1884
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:55,960
topic but but my my immediate thought is

1885
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:58,750
that it could very well be an experiment

1886
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:02,830
to see what what will stick and to be

1887
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:06,340
able to identify an upward trend and get

1888
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:08,170
on at the at the ground level as new

1889
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:12,250
content starts starts to stick and take

1890
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:13,659
off a lot of what's roughly kind of you

1891
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:15,070
know I think I don't even remember if I

1892
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:16,299
still had the trolls up there but

1893
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:19,440
like the stuff that comes out HN and

1894
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:21,820
4chan the kind of for the lulz stuff

1895
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:24,160
it's the it's fighting the culture wars

1896
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,750
right it's like this it's their culture

1897
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,950
warriors fighting the culture war online

1898
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,570
and that's the point of view and that's

1899
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:32,490
what they're kind of going for sometimes

1900
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:32,490
it's you know the the sort of like

1901
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:37,959
trolling mischief really did kind of

1902
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:41,849
take a dark turn at some point over the

1903
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:43,960
last five years probably around 2015

1904
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:45,130
2014 maybe they kind of like when it

1905
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,370
became like gamergate and

1906
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:49,390
and you started to see a lot of the

1907
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:51,550
again a lot of the activity where there

1908
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:53,170
was that that line between coordinated

1909
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:54,550
activism and freedom of expression and

1910
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:57,250
then things that really moved into the

1911
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:59,650
realm of harassment misinformation

1912
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:01,270
targeting I'm targeting people with lies

1913
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:02,889
to try to ruin their lives during their

1914
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:04,990
careers targeting companies with the

1915
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:07,330
same kind of thing some of the some of

1916
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:09,400
the actions against companies that may

1917
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:10,990
take a particular social position that

1918
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,549
they disagree with and so that kind of

1919
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:14,889
trolling is really done as sort of like

1920
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:18,610
another front in the culture war I think

1921
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:21,070
there's also this this aspect where some

1922
01:15:18,610 --> 01:15:23,259
of these campaigns are organizations

1923
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:25,450
that are recruiting individuals to

1924
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:27,820
participate or propagate the campaign

1925
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:30,940
and I think some of these this malicious

1926
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:33,130
trolling is essentially individuals who

1927
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:36,129
unfortunately that is who they are as

1928
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:38,920
people and they find each other and form

1929
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:40,240
a group so it's a bit more organic in

1930
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,340
the sense that it may just be for

1931
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:46,420
personal fulfillment of the individuals

1932
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:47,680
who are participating thanks great we

1933
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:49,000
got time for maybe one or two more

1934
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,440
questions I appreciate everyone so far

1935
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,560
keeping these as questions so we're able

1936
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,700
to get through some more so thank you hi

1937
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,660
francie.rose know University of

1938
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:58,150
Washington

1939
01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:00,490
one thing I find really interesting is

1940
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:01,900
this breakdown of different strategies

1941
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:04,150
and different motivations of different

1942
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:05,920
actors because presumably different

1943
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:08,650
defensive strategies will be effective

1944
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:10,180
against them and so I'm wondering if you

1945
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:13,570
have any thoughts about that and so for

1946
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:15,910
example the the more politically

1947
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:17,620
motivated examples that we talked about

1948
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:19,510
here seem like they might be different

1949
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,590
from more financially motivated ones

1950
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:22,780
that's one thing that we didn't talk

1951
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:24,520
about yet too much that I find really

1952
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:26,380
interesting is the role of just the

1953
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,860
advertising ecosystem not just in its

1954
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:31,440
ability to target but also to finance

1955
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:33,179
operations and so I guess it's a broad

1956
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,469
question but I'm curious if you have any

1957
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:37,050
thoughts about the breakdown of these

1958
01:16:34,469 --> 01:16:40,199
different scenarios and which are more

1959
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:41,460
important or more difficult or easier to

1960
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:43,259
target or if there's things that we can

1961
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:44,900
do to kind of target defending against

1962
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:48,090
all of them at once

1963
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,769
so I'll be really fast because I just

1964
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:51,750
have one initial thought on this is I

1965
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:53,820
really think it's not just platforms I

1966
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:55,889
have to be regulated I think there are a

1967
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:59,509
lot of people in the information

1968
01:16:55,889 --> 01:17:02,040
industry that need a lot more oversight

1969
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:04,679
in terms of what they're allowed to

1970
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:07,679
spread and how they they can spread it

1971
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:09,389
and and I don't mean in terms of like

1972
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:12,869
censoring content but I mean for example

1973
01:17:09,389 --> 01:17:14,040
like why is it okay for a PR firm to

1974
01:17:12,869 --> 01:17:15,839
create a whole bunch of trolling

1975
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,610
accounts on behalf of a company and get

1976
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,199
paid for that

1977
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:21,119
so that would be like my initial thought

1978
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:24,000
is that a I think a regulation on just

1979
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:26,400
the platforms is not enough to answer

1980
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,800
and I know we have a couple like seconds

1981
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,989
left

1982
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,400
we've done some again drawing on like

1983
01:17:30,989 --> 01:17:33,959
the kind of kill chain methodology

1984
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,489
looking at staging and then looking at

1985
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,850
actor types and how they intersect with

1986
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:40,980
that we do constantly in every campaign

1987
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:44,489
every type of campaign so much of it

1988
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:45,509
comes back to fake accounts and so one

1989
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:46,678
of the things that I've been working on

1990
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:48,030
is some writing around what is the

1991
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:49,380
future of identity on the Internet look

1992
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:52,679
like great how do you how do you think

1993
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:54,840
about that as since that is the linchpin

1994
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:57,330
of so much of this how do we preserve

1995
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:59,340
anonymity had a preserve persistent

1996
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:00,600
pseudonymity maybe we move towards

1997
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:02,610
persistent pseudonymity but how do we

1998
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:04,650
think about understanding the kind of

1999
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:06,000
bulk account creation process I have

2000
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:07,619
slides with like the various black

2001
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,360
markets where you can buy them we know

2002
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:11,099
state actors buy them we know spammers

2003
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,199
buy them there's like people are like

2004
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:15,030
farming digital identities at this point

2005
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:17,099
you just create a couple and growth you

2006
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:18,900
know grow your personas and then flip

2007
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:21,330
them and you have all of these different

2008
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:24,089
things that you can choose from like the

2009
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:25,409
vintage of the account is likely you

2010
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:27,150
know particularly if it started before

2011
01:18:25,409 --> 01:18:28,799
times when Facebook was more actively

2012
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:31,949
policing the creation of accounts at

2013
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,659
creation vintage accounts from like 2009

2014
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:35,610
2010 are worth a ton of money on the

2015
01:18:33,659 --> 01:18:39,388
black markets and so there is this

2016
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:41,880
interesting element of how do we look at

2017
01:18:39,389 --> 01:18:42,329
that very top level first step this is

2018
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,909
or

2019
01:18:42,329 --> 01:18:49,049
every actor type goes first and then

2020
01:18:44,909 --> 01:18:50,460
begin to address that I think sorry and

2021
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:51,780
thinks and we are now out of time we

2022
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,579
have the blinking red light I want to

2023
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,719
our panel so assuming will ply stick

2024
01:18:53,579 --> 01:18:56,820
around least for a few minutes if anyone

2025
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,440
has additional questions please feel

2026
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:02,269
free to come on up but I go around

2027
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,269
