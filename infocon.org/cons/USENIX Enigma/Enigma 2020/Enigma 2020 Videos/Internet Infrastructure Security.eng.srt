1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,520
hi everybody thank you very much and I

2
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,200
really want to look under the hood of

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,369
the Internet with you a little bit today

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,230
and talk about some governance related

5
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:30,810
shortcomings that we should all think

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,360
about this talk is based on the

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,430
experience and the ongoing work of K C

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,500
Class E and myself case C is the

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,160
directive queda de Center for Applied

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,420
internet data analysis based at UCSD in

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,300
San Diego

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,780
I've already been introduced so if we're

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,000
looking at tech news and also what's

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,510
happening at this very conference we see

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,700
a lot of application layer and

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,570
application layer plus type risks and

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,610
issues right

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,980
we just had election security we talked

19
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,039
about disinformation

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:08,039
and if we have read out the news right

21
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:10,259
we were are aware of privacy issues when

22
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:14,070
it comes to companies using your images

23
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:17,009
for facial recognition what's

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,539
interesting about these things apart

25
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,750
from the fact that we haven't really

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,110
solved them is also that they all rely

27
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,950
on data being transferred via the

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,369
internet so as I said I want to go under

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,659
the hood of the internet a little and

30
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:36,150
unfortunately remind you it's not that

31
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,229
good under there either and when I say

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,689
under the hood I'm going to focus on the

33
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,900
governance of the free fundamental

34
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:49,079
layers that requires some level of

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,850
governance to guarantee consistent and

36
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,439
reliable interpretation and that is

37
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,449
addressing routing and naming so as I've

38
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,429
already alluded to these fundamental

39
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,460
functions matter profoundly because

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,130
everything we do on T internet all our

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,619
nice apps rely on the integrity

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,500
availability and confidentiality of this

43
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,860
underlying infrastructure as many of you

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,989
will know all this dates back to the 70s

45
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,290
and 80s when he was a US government

46
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,690
funded research project that escaped the

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,390
lab we can't really say it escaped the

48
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,020
lab too early because it wasn't actually

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,390
built or designed to do the first social

50
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,320
fundamental functions we wanted to

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:38,299
perform today just Fink banking or

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:41,060
medical communications obviously right

53
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,750
we can't say that these aspirations were

54
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,000
no one's mind at least not by the 1990s

55
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:51,650
people were thinking about these use

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,320
cases but when the 1990s came around the

57
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:57,410
US government which had been the primary

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,750
administrator and funder of the infinite

59
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,630
infrastructure thus far perceived a

60
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,550
higher order challenge and what they did

61
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,850
in terms of policy changed course of

62
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:10,670
history and impacts profoundly on the

63
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:14,150
regulation and standards landscape we

64
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:17,089
have today so what was that at the time

65
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,700
the US government had taken about 40

66
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,260
years to break up the telecom monopolies

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,079
and it seems they didn't want to do that

68
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,929
again and so they were trying to

69
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,510
explicitly foster a competitive and

70
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:35,390
innovative information technology

71
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:38,000
industry so amid accusations that the US

72
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,309
funded research and educational networks

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,190
were competing with an Internet industry

74
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,790
that was just emerging and the US

75
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:49,609
government launched strategic industrial

76
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,179
policies trying to promote competition

77
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:56,330
and innovation in the emerging internet

78
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,260
transport and domain and industries but

79
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:03,170
as I said before already addressing

80
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,750
routing and naming require a level of

81
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,339
centralized governance so the US

82
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,830
government in technical community

83
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,500
cooperated and created a nonprofit

84
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,800
corporation that was supposed to be to

85
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:19,220
steward of the addressing and naming

86
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:22,130
systems quickly going into tech even

87
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,020
though this is the governance panel in

88
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,500
addressing we usually don't want to have

89
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,510
machines with the same IP address that

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,030
usually leads to problems even though

91
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:34,370
there are some exceptions to this rule

92
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,859
you want your autonomous system numbers

93
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,110
to be unique and

94
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,699
when it comes to names right if you type

95
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,719
in using x.org

96
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:46,879
you do want to arrive at the same

97
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:51,199
service or site every time and from

98
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:54,909
whatever you are so the result of this

99
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,849
technical need plus the les affaires

100
00:04:54,909 --> 00:05:00,949
self-regulation approach that was chosen

101
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:02,628
we got ICANN the international

102
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:07,490
cooperation of Assigned Names and

103
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:10,250
numbers so I can is a fun beast it's not

104
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,409
just an administrator it is a policy

105
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,430
firm that makes the rules for the domain

106
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:19,669
name system specifically for generic

107
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,520
top-level domains those other dot coms

108
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:25,068
and dot nets and not those that are

109
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,139
country codes recognizable because they

110
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:32,150
only have two letters dot u s dot u K

111
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:36,050
dot d e I want to reiterate creating I

112
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,479
can in this way of a serving dysfunction

113
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:42,500
was serious industrial policy and then

114
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,589
hadn't really been done before so I can

115
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,800
policymaking intern is also a fun little

116
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:51,949
based it follows the multi-stakeholder

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,569
approach and that also hadn't really

118
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,909
been done before in that fashion and

119
00:05:53,569 --> 00:06:00,379
what they talked about in what they do

120
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:03,919
is for example deciding and creating

121
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:05,810
rules on what goes into D who is and

122
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,878
then what is accessible or not

123
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,389
accessible this surely something some

124
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:13,520
people in this room have dealt with and

125
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:14,960
if you go to an Ikon meeting you kind of

126
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,270
see this in action right you meet

127
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,870
industry you meet government you meet

128
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,810
civil society but if you look around you

129
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:27,219
will find that the domain name industry

130
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,379
the contractor parties are extremely

131
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:32,409
over-represented son for the lucky ones

132
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,699
who don't know what this all means

133
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:36,680
contractor parties include registries

134
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,960
that run the TLD is like dot-com or

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:44,270
dotnet and registrar's the Roca Ram

136
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,120
registrations for registrants the

137
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,198
registrant that is you when you feel you

138
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,099
really need your name dot ninja

139
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,409
to link to your website so existing

140
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,628
alongside I can write we have a

141
00:06:55,409 --> 00:07:00,300
technical standards community that deals

142
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:03,419
with the kind of lower level issues so

143
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,259
the IETF spent significant effort since

144
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:09,270
the 90s to develop technical solutions

145
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,699
or patches or whatever you want to name

146
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,359
it to the underlying naming and routing

147
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:16,499
protocols for example cryptographic

148
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,430
authentication has been added to these

149
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:24,839
layers however and this is again no news

150
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:28,139
to this room not all security issues are

151
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,210
purely technical and not all security

152
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,789
issues can be solved or at rest

153
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,479
technically at least not efficiently and

154
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:38,849
effectively so in addition it appears

155
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,490
that the engineers particularly in the

156
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:44,360
beginning did the parts they could do

157
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,580
but they tended to not consider or

158
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,550
misjudge their political economy in

159
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:55,109
which their solutions would be embedded

160
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:58,830
or deployed in so going back to what I

161
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:03,060
just said not all issues are best

162
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,698
addressed by technical approaches or

163
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:09,139
solutions and sometimes it's better to

164
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:11,879
go through management essentially the

165
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:14,189
levels beyond the standard layers of the

166
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,279
OSI model so what we call layers 8 9 and

167
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:21,139
10 users organizations and governance so

168
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:24,419
to give you a simple example if I

169
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:26,699
register a domain with a registrar what

170
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:30,409
checks do they have in place to make

171
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,409
sure that what I'm doing is legitimate

172
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,919
then there are various issues that can't

173
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,559
be solved with protocol changes but have

174
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,978
to do with how things are managed on a

175
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,069
technical or organizational level so now

176
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,779
we're best practices so the IETF and I

177
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:51,479
can security stability in Weiser

178
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,290
committee and many of us wrote various

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,149
best practice documents over the years

180
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,329
essentially giving you guidelines of how

181
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:02,830
to do things well but but best practices

182
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:05,589
they're often not deployed

183
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:08,890
because they're pricey and if we look at

184
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:12,160
the domain market that I'm focusing on

185
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:17,740
in particular it's extremely competitive

186
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,810
when it comes to price so security costs

187
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:24,940
and you don't know you don't want to

188
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:27,400
spend in as a result our fundamental

189
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,650
core systems including the DNS and

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,810
routing do not provide sufficient

191
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,840
controls to really uphold integrity

192
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:38,170
availability and confidentiality and

193
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:41,500
while technologically speaking we do

194
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,959
have options were often lacking the

195
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,050
layer eight nine-ten solutions as well

196
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:52,060
as the incentives to deploy what is

197
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:55,870
already available this codes from 2004

198
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,329
by the way just so everyone notices many

199
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,730
voices right this includes law

200
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:03,100
enforcement companies consumer

201
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,650
protection champions and others have

202
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,410
called for a change of how Internet

203
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:10,569
Governance is handled and approached in

204
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:16,180
this like Internet Governance in icon

205
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:19,690
sphere but unfortunately I have to tell

206
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,300
you that there is a problem if I can and

207
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:25,690
other bodies like it it is technically

208
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:30,219
open to all we can go but meaningful

209
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:34,000
participation requires time and money

210
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,820
and naturally large vested interests

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,850
like the corporations that deal with the

212
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:42,340
DNS space that offer services will be

213
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,070
heavily involved in and try to steer the

214
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,850
governance processes because these

215
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:51,670
impact on the operating environment and

216
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:55,090
their profit margins and surprising and

217
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:58,329
can't blame them however the non profit

218
00:10:55,090 --> 00:11:00,400
driven stakeholders academics civil

219
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:05,140
society consumer protection agencies

220
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:08,170
they don't have the resources to invest

221
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,630
in this and there does less well able to

222
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:14,349
have their interests represented and to

223
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:16,339
shape policy interestingly to a lesser

224
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,620
extent even large cooperate

225
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:23,629
who are not he's kind of contracted

226
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:25,670
parties DNS players tell me they

227
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:28,970
struggle to have their voices heard that

228
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:32,628
I can because the DNS stakeholders are

229
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:34,730
so present and so overwhelming and the

230
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,559
effect of this imbalance is that the

231
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,139
concerns and the needs of the billions

232
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,689
of Internet users and many people offer

233
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:44,800
products are not considered as much as

234
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:48,769
they should be at this fundamental level

235
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,829
now going into specifics a little bit so

236
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:53,899
various I can review teams have raised

237
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:56,029
issues that relate to this governance

238
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,699
problem that I just outlined including

239
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,939
SSR to the second security stability and

240
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:06,709
resiliency review team that Casey and I

241
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:08,509
are part of so for example if you look

242
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:12,518
into things you will find that I can

243
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:18,379
contracts have close to no language

244
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:21,470
addressing systemic abuse by that abuse

245
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:23,629
we here mean criminal domain

246
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,420
registrations of phishing malware cetera

247
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:30,220
cetera I know some definitions go

248
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,929
further as an example up name's

249
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:37,429
Gibraltar based company and they were

250
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:41,019
responsible as a registrar for more than

251
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:46,730
fifty percent of the new general TLD

252
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:50,779
domains that Spamhaus blacklisted on

253
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:54,170
your own that's that's that's a feat it

254
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:56,480
folded lucky us but not because anyone

255
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,709
stuck them but because they stopped

256
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:04,249
paying their fees well this I can say I

257
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:06,138
quote there are potential limitations on

258
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:08,480
the actions that I can all can take in

259
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:10,939
addressing DNS infrastructure abuse in

260
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,639
even a registry agreement nor to 2013

261
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:15,589
registrar at accreditation agreement has

262
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,569
enforceable provisions prohibiting or

263
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:19,970
authorizing sanctions against systemic

264
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:22,219
deism DNS infrastructure abuse in

265
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,019
addition the RA and I can policies is

266
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,879
currently defined it do not authorize I

267
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:26,640
can hook to require registries to

268
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,970
suspend

269
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,779
to lead potentially abusive domain names

270
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:35,720
bummer at the same time right I don't

271
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,149
want to be too much of a downer here um

272
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,720
not always bad so I can talk to team the

273
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:44,760
office of the CTO helps various parties

274
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,790
with deploying DNS SEC which in turn

275
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,910
helps ensuring integrity they coordinate

276
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:54,240
with law enforcement they take part in

277
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:57,290
and he abuse fora etc etc I can as a

278
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,320
whole helps funding and the support

279
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:06,290
various projects and initiatives to work

280
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:09,740
on threats to the internet but

281
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:12,740
unfortunately the overall policy

282
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,630
imbalance I am talking about here is

283
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:20,279
systemic you can't solve this by

284
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:23,339
outreach and cooperation it's also not

285
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:26,550
some kind of conspiracy within a system

286
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:32,250
that otherwise works it is system

287
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:35,010
inherent and just to note again not to

288
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,230
be too much of a downer there is some

289
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:41,959
bad actors that we actually can identify

290
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,959
but also many that that are not

291
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:51,180
additionally we are facing an issue

292
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:55,560
across technology and this is that the

293
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,529
impact of technology on society is messy

294
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,339
it's a challenge for tactical standards

295
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:04,649
bodies and companies in the past right

296
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,779
if we go back a few years

297
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:10,709
techno standard making was about making

298
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,260
stuff work and now it's much more about

299
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,609
ethics and howdy standards for impact in

300
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,180
different countries all over the world

301
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,519
and rest assured whatever you do or not

302
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:24,300
to someone will be shouting at you and

303
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:28,649
be hating on you so before I move on to

304
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:32,060
the success I want to reiterate that

305
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:36,380
this hands of approach that was taken

306
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:39,459
has facilitated technical innovation

307
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,410
competition and technological progress

308
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:45,779
I've driven down the price of resources

309
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:48,069
like hosting domains etc etc however

310
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,619
right while the near general

311
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:53,469
availability and the low prices do

312
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:55,990
benefit everyday users they have also

313
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,959
got an unintended consequence and that

314
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:02,619
is enabling inevitable elements of the

315
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:05,969
human condition crime and that are often

316
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:10,029
kept in check by law and regulations

317
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:13,480
solutions now it gets fun so it is no

318
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:15,459
surprise that due to the technically

319
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,069
open but heavily Stratus host certified

320
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:20,050
nature of Internet governance goals like

321
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:21,429
public security and safety have often

322
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:25,779
been neglected in the current

323
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:29,259
environment provisions for security

324
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:30,999
would drive down profits of the parties

325
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,939
that are invested in the governance base

326
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:36,610
I can that's if you're proponent of

327
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:39,099
security you struggle to tackle these

328
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:43,029
issues through the existing policy

329
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:46,360
avenues in addition we even lack the

330
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:48,549
data and the insight and us interest

331
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,059
bodies and independent researchers have

332
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:54,160
trouble to comprehensively study and use

333
00:16:52,059 --> 00:17:01,240
security the relationship between policy

334
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:03,699
pricing costs and abuse so calling for

335
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,549
regulatory oversight has become more

336
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:09,459
common due to what some see as market

337
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:12,459
failures but that raises a number of

338
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,990
empirical questions what are the biggest

339
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,500
security threats to the Internet

340
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:21,309
infrastructure how can we understand if

341
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:24,010
not quantify the effectiveness of the

342
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:26,939
different risk mitigation strategies or

343
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:30,100
even to what extent defenses have been

344
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,230
successfully deployed let's take a

345
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,120
totally different angle on this what is

346
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:39,820
government's supposed to do and of

347
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:42,489
course which government regulatory

348
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,490
oversight is not a simple thing we can

349
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,690
just create and be done with right we're

350
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:52,680
talking about naturally unnecessarily

351
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,540
global regulation and policy making

352
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,410
assuming we want to keep the internet

353
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:02,940
global and there any yeah they're not

354
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:05,670
really any examples of you know how to

355
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,520
do this they're not really templates and

356
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:11,490
we cannot just fix this in a talk like

357
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,580
the one I'm giving you right now but

358
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,950
what I'm trying to do is to urge you to

359
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:20,280
think about these issues because we

360
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,410
really have to so who should be in

361
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:26,010
charge we could do government-backed

362
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,800
regulators right but I can transitioned

363
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,780
away from Department of Commerce

364
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,970
oversight because it was not considered

365
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,340
appropriate for the US government to be

366
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,550
technically in charge of disk level

367
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,100
infrastructure other countries have

368
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,020
called for states to play the role of

369
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,060
Internet Governance anyway so the

370
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,550
question remains who should actually

371
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,980
control the sphere who should select the

372
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,879
body that does this oversight that does

373
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,970
the policymaking

374
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,430
whom should they be accountable to and

375
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:59,250
what should their mission be so I've

376
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:01,500
been asked to think about how this space

377
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,600
would look like if I could use a magic

378
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,900
wand to get there well what we want well

379
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,419
I'd like a highly transparent steward

380
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,710
it's not beholden to or captured by one

381
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,990
specific interest group because

382
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,330
governments or industry that steward

383
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,610
have would have to be paid directly by

384
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,980
registrants or users and des be

385
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,110
responsible to them not a specific

386
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,360
interest we need accountability a proper

387
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,909
representation of parties we want to

388
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,979
hear all sides and decision making

389
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:32,970
processes that do not cut some people

390
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,830
out security should be upheld privacy

391
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,690
efficiency effectiveness of processes

392
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,340
cetera cetera as you can see there's a

393
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,830
lot I want with my magic wand

394
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,720
so more practically speaking in the

395
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,990
short term we must recognize that the

396
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,250
current lack of data and access

397
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,110
undermines our understanding of the

398
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,700
status quo

399
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,979
we have to consider that essentially

400
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,080
everything relies on data being

401
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,750
transferred over the Internet and it's

402
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,449
crucial for us to think about baseline

403
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,180
protocol level security and a network

404
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,470
that we send all our stuff over and

405
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,119
without open and available data we

406
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,999
cannot fully understand the into

407
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:12,029
that and how its protocols work and

408
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,859
particularly how they fail we need

409
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:16,139
independent parties to be able to

410
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,749
analyze these core systems reveal what

411
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:21,089
is happening and help us to improve the

412
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:23,279
digital road network in short we cannot

413
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:26,428
fix the issues we don't know about in

414
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:28,619
the medium term we argue that policy for

415
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,569
alike I can will have to be reorganized

416
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:32,639
to give a stronger voice to consumer

417
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:34,199
protection interests and the independent

418
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,839
experts and researchers that support

419
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:38,519
them one option would be to adopt a

420
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,649
parliament style approach where

421
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,839
different groups have a number of seats

422
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:45,478
and they have to form alliances to have

423
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,769
enough votes to actually pass policy and

424
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:49,289
this would make it harder for niche

425
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:53,429
interests to dominate as much as they do

426
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:56,789
now at the same time final slide to

427
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:58,919
bigger problems lack of funding for many

428
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,769
civil society and consumer advocacy

429
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,119
groups and this goes far beyond the icon

430
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,159
realm

431
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:08,428
the other is I cans financial dependence

432
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,829
on the contract at parties in the long

433
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:12,929
term we need the regulatory function or

434
00:21:10,829 --> 00:21:14,729
at least some form of oversight to be

435
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:17,759
financially independent from the

436
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:19,589
industry it regulates there are options

437
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,849
that don't go that far but you could do

438
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:25,049
that internally for example we could add

439
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:26,668
systemic abuse provision city I can

440
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,049
contract and then silo off the

441
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:30,269
compliance function I haven't provided

442
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:32,369
externally we could have more stringent

443
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:34,739
rules about who can join the board and

444
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:36,869
how they have to disclose conflicts of

445
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:39,299
interest and we could also submit the

446
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:42,869
organization to external third party

447
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:44,879
audits however as long as the money

448
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:46,738
flows from a special interest group the

449
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:49,019
contract the parties to ICANN and not

450
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:51,269
from the registrants - I can the

451
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:53,189
organisation cannot gain this

452
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,169
independence which is why this last

453
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:57,200
point is so important thank you very

454
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:59,260
much

455
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,260
you
