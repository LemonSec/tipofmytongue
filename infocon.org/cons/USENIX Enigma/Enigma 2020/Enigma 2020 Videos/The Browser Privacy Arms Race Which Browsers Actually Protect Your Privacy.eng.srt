1
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,960
hi so this is the last one we're almost

2
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,640
done

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,890
at least before lunch so who are we

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,920
EF f is a nonprofit that fights for your

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,239
civil liberties we're a collection of

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,210
activists lawyers and technologists and

7
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:39,390
we look at the world we live in in the

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,640
digital world not just from the eye of a

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,890
technologist or from the eye of policy

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,080
but we look at both how they intersect

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,059
how they affect people and this means

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,409
that we work in a in a wide variety of

13
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:55,799
subjects from AI coders rights voter

14
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:59,670
election Christian Freeman speech

15
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:02,610
privacy which is the main talk but we

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,370
also develop software we've that was Sir

17
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,650
but many of you I'm guessing have you

18
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:10,740
state issue peace everywhere pricey

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,590
badger panoptic like so we try to have a

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,810
collection of tools to fight for your

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,369
liberties whether that's with policy or

22
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:24,439
with tools coding tools so we fight for

23
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,960
the users so why does this talk matter

24
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,359
the browser's are most people's window

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,100
into the internet that's what they use

26
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,250
to access information that's what they

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:39,059
use to chat with other people or you

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:42,149
know just share something so which

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,549
window you use is important and the most

30
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:47,399
prevalent windows are the ones that set

31
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,920
the tone for this conversation now we

32
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,479
also know that users do not usually

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,060
change the defaults so defaults are

34
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,039
important so not only are the windows

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,319
important but the defaults that these

36
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,619
windows offer are really really

37
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:05,759
important to know which rights users

38
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,890
actually can enjoy so the Internet

39
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,960
should be an opt-in and should empower

40
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,890
users where the defaults are respecting

41
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,440
their rights so a lot of times when I

42
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,100
talk about privacy and especially in the

43
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,900
in in this space of browsing the

44
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,450
Internet a lot of people say you know

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,640
who cares about more relevant and ads

46
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,160
anyway it's just like if I like shoes

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,790
right

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,560
blue or so what if they got her some

49
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:38,019
information it's not a big deal well as

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,900
we've learned it in use these past two

51
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,140
years I think mostly it's not just some

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:48,160
information now advertisers take a lot

53
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,459
more than that and here's a big list of

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,960
them you know it goes age gender race

55
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,740
address where it's physical or email

56
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:00,250
your location which goes into a very

57
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,110
very very narrow location is not just in

58
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,130
general weather country or city you live

59
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,380
in your browser which device time you

60
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,390
spent on the side how you've moved your

61
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,540
mouse or on the side if you hover over a

62
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,420
specific thing for how long do you click

63
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,739
or not click your health data oh do you

64
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,299
were you writing a message but you

65
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,450
decided not to send it so you delete it

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,570
data gets blocked too so it's a lot more

67
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,079
information that the general public is

68
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,480
aware of and they can infer a lot of

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,370
things either directly or indirectly

70
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,340
from that information you can compiled

71
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,180
several different databases you can join

72
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,850
different types of data and figure out a

73
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,760
lot of things your politics your health

74
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,400
condition religion belief sexual

75
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,940
orientation how is an interest your

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,020
personality or are you going and where

77
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,660
are you going not just because you

78
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,560
search but because I can figure out

79
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,180
probably where you're going to come next

80
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,890
because I have been spying on where you

81
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:06,640
go all the time and we know or who

82
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:09,250
you've met so what can they do with it

83
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,609
marketing is what everyone talks about

84
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,200
for more relevant ads that you probably

85
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,500
ignore anyway there's a lot of studies

86
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,668
about that but that's a different talk

87
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,130
decide why you see from your friends

88
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:23,440
they get to decide what news you and

89
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,510
from which ID lets you see you and they

90
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,969
get to decide what you should interact

91
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,849
with what generates more engagement for

92
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:33,850
them so we start saying that it's who

93
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,860
decides what for the users and it should

94
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:40,240
be the users that decide what they want

95
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,960
and this contract try your psychological

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,970
button

97
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,650
and this is not some paranoid talk about

98
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:49,419
what could happen if this is real stuff

99
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,370
experiments that have been run that

100
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:53,380
every time we hear about it it's a coups

101
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,419
we didn't intend that it won't happen

102
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,490
again and a few months later or a year

103
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:58,240
later we have another IRB's and I year

104
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,280
later oops

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,500
and we continue having oops and it's

106
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:07,210
about time that we stop having oops

107
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,400
because it's getting really creepy and

108
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,239
yeah they can control your anger your

109
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,159
happiness your depression your fear this

110
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:19,389
goes beyond to just serving some

111
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:23,080
relevant ads so what are the browsers

112
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:25,300
actually doing on the last couple of

113
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,820
years we've seen a change in the

114
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,759
conversation of the that the public and

115
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,110
policy makers are having finally privacy

116
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,270
is actually something important

117
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,400
something that we care about we always

118
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,859
care about but we didn't really know how

119
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,479
much we care about it until now until we

120
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,110
saw how they could use it to manipulate

121
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,520
elections or how we feel and the

122
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,440
browser's are catching up to this

123
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,070
they're starting to do things to protect

124
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,199
their users to protect their rights so

125
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,860
let's look at a couple of them which are

126
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,710
the main windows of the Internet Apple

127
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,430
would suffer a day for a lot ITP

128
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,690
which is protections for a user based on

129
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,370
how you interact with the site if

130
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,139
there's meaningful interaction with the

131
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,860
site and this is a way to protect them

132
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,810
from third-party trackers and sites that

133
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,940
they're actually not should not be

134
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,009
sharing information with they've also

135
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,380
had battles with credo for example and

136
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,539
all for a lot of you you've never heard

137
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,539
this name but Korea is a very large

138
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:28,270
company that likes to gather data and

139
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:32,979
their their money comes from tracking

140
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:35,500
users and selling these data and when

141
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,930
they saw ITP taking a lot of their

142
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,900
customers which are very valuable for

143
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,630
advertisers they decided that the best

144
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,820
way to react to this was to use a

145
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,180
security feature in the browser to

146
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:54,070
continue tracking users HSTs so they

147
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:56,140
could have a super cooking in in HSTs

148
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:59,440
and apples responded to these but it's

149
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,030
it's a continuous battle there were been

150
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,070
working a lot and having larger than

151
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,909
image sets for their users so every user

152
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:10,420
looks the same unfortunately they don't

153
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,090
like giving users the choice and there

154
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,930
are no extensions and we'll talk about

155
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:19,479
why that's important brave has been

156
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,370
incorporating a lot of things has a

157
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,810
supersaver where built-in has a lot of

158
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,680
center and fingerprinting techniques

159
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:30,190
built in as it's blocking trackers by

160
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,320
the easy list has chromium extensions so

161
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,020
they've been adding and adding and

162
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,580
eyeing features to protect their users

163
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,349
on the privacy side and the security

164
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,620
side because it's been a priority for

165
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,660
him same for Firefox Firefox has made a

166
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,430
lot of changes lately to make sure that

167
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,950
your users are privacy has been

168
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,870
respected you know they have had a

169
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,820
disconnect tracker blocking list for a

170
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,340
while they have the widgets and

171
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,930
containers they allow you to install

172
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,549
third-party extensions because they

173
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,470
understand they can not account for all

174
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,150
of the cases because the Internet is

175
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,960
very diverse so you can style things

176
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:08,500
that cover maybe your your particular

177
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,500
set model tory's always talked about in

178
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,560
terms of security and privacy it's kind

179
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,000
of a niche case because it has features

180
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,630
that are great for security and privacy

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,760
but maybe for the largest amount of use

182
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,620
for most users you may be hard to use

183
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,690
but you get I should sever where you

184
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,370
have a large data pool and of course you

185
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,060
have a lot of fancy furniture printing

186
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,870
protections with that animatable then we

187
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,849
have chrome which is removing

188
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,039
fingerprinting vectors like a lot of

189
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,280
data that comes in the user agent but

190
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,579
not track you're blocking no protection

191
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,650
for trackers killing meaningful privacy

192
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,930
extensions because you know if you're

193
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,569
not already doing the job yourself of

194
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,849
protecting users let's also remove the

195
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:58,150
possibility of them to have meaningful

196
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,190
privacy extensions and let's not only do

197
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,220
that with lists or post standards to

198
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:07,569
even track better users in ways that

199
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:10,509
they cannot remove what is MGM doing

200
00:09:07,569 --> 00:09:12,160
so now that is based on chromium they

201
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:14,920
actually added what Crum should have

202
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,629
added which is tracking protections in

203
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,699
past versions they always supported the

204
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:21,519
NT and did a lot of work on and these

205
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:24,399
are things and the question is will it

206
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,170
support extensions in the future they do

207
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:31,120
now but we don't know if they will

208
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:33,219
commit to that so you know there's when

209
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,949
will rank them or the pronoun ranking

210
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,079
them here stacking them up it's about

211
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:42,670
their current actions and their actual

212
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:44,829
plans these are not grades like you if

213
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,689
they got a tick is not they got an A+

214
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:49,089
and they're good to go it just means

215
00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:51,430
that they have done something about it

216
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:54,970
so don't take the Greens as they're

217
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:58,599
perfect because no one is so

218
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,550
fingerprinting fingerprinting is when I

219
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:06,639
take characteristics of your browser and

220
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:09,550
that seemed simple if you look at them

221
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,199
in individually like what size of screen

222
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,209
do you have like what funds do you have

223
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:15,758
installed but when you compile them all

224
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:17,739
you can figure out pretty much which

225
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,629
person is switched you can identify them

226
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,949
and separate them individually we have a

227
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:22,839
project that has been doing this for

228
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:24,008
years that shows you how things are

229
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,040
printable do you are called pan

230
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:27,850
optically and all of the browser's do

231
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,129
something about it

232
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,499
you know Firefox blocks known third

233
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:35,399
parties doing fingerprinting Chrome has

234
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:37,929
ace committing to reduce the user agent

235
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,120
Safari does stuff about canvas if you're

236
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:42,579
printing for example tor does a lot

237
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,910
rockin scripts making sure that all

238
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:48,910
their browsers look the same brave the

239
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:52,929
active forbid access to two commonly

240
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,550
used techniques and edge same as

241
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:58,120
chromium since there you have doubt to

242
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:00,429
it what can you do about fingerprinting

243
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,800
there's a lot of low-hanging fruit the

244
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:04,779
user agent is one of those and we're

245
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,579
glad to see that a lot of browsers are

246
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:09,910
committed now to remove a lot of that

247
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:13,179
data that has no point of being there to

248
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:15,189
begin with and many times the point of

249
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,929
fingerprinting is to create I have large

250
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:18,370
anonymity pool and that means that when

251
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:20,610
you're a browser saying your browser

252
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,739
looks just exactly as

253
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,829
else's browsers so you cannot be

254
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:27,959
identified just by that now that in

255
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,609
reality is really hard so this doesn't

256
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,719
mean that fingerprinting should not is

257
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,910
not a problem that should be addressed

258
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,439
but it just means that if you're looking

259
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,329
for larger than a pool

260
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:38,879
you're gonna hit with some realities and

261
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,769
some of those realities are whether you

262
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,959
control all of the hard work or your

263
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,939
browser is implemented or not if you do

264
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,569
you're gonna have an easier time to

265
00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:53,040
build that thing up an immunity pool the

266
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:55,529
other one is how far your users going to

267
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,439
go into breaking their web experience or

268
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:00,449
not doing certain things so the browser

269
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:02,429
will look the same and Tory is a good

270
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:03,089
example of that so it's it's kind of not

271
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,649
fair

272
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,139
compression when you talk about a large

273
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,209
and in a deep pools but that doesn't

274
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,999
mean that there cannot be efforts to

275
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:14,699
reduce a fingerprint or make your finger

276
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:17,129
your pull a little bit larger so you

277
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:19,670
know just consider all of these aspects

278
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:23,970
when we're talking about anonymity pools

279
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,709
you can offer different order other

280
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,879
types of protections like here's an idea

281
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:31,469
HD ot tunneling now these are more

282
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,929
options are coming into the browser's

283
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,850
except for Safari but all of their

284
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:37,709
browsers are implementing different ones

285
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,160
and they're giving options to users

286
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:43,439
why because third parties and sites are

287
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,238
not the only threat vector for privacy

288
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,529
so you need to consider all of those

289
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:48,419
it's not just the website you're

290
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,730
visiting is the mediant where you're

291
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,350
transmitting your data to and you have

292
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,449
to allow users to choose so if you have

293
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,910
those options and you can allow users to

294
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:59,099
choose between them having good defaults

295
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,959
is a it's important but having ordered

296
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,410
and the good defaults for different

297
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,359
threat vectors is also very important

298
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:09,118
and now more to the most important part

299
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,999
of of where I want to get is the tracker

300
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:14,129
blocking capabilities almost all of them

301
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:17,220
are doing something meaningful about it

302
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:19,949
and they all have different approaches

303
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,519
to it some of them are using lists some

304
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:26,128
of them are using eristic and some of

305
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,059
them are looking at behavior or or a mix

306
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:32,009
of them and honestly I don't think lists

307
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,930
are better than heuristics or and

308
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:35,850
behavior I think we should be using

309
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,469
a combined approach because you can

310
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,649
catch different sort of different things

311
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,810
with different methods you have to

312
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:45,480
balance that protection also with not

313
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,979
break in the web we know this because

314
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,110
when we build pricey badger

315
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,120
if we go too aggressive will break the

316
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:55,080
word for everyone so how do you achieve

317
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,970
that you search for a good balance or

318
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,560
you are given the most privacy you can

319
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,959
to users without breaking their

320
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,930
experience a good example of that is

321
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,689
yellow lists where you know there's a

322
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,540
certain source that might be doing

323
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:11,370
tracking or is doing tracking but it's

324
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,959
essential for the web not to break so

325
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,690
what you can do is try to allow the

326
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,550
resource to load but do your best to

327
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,490
protect the user like removing the

328
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:24,449
capability to install to set cookies or

329
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,459
access storage or try to fingerprint you

330
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:30,149
need to also be transparent with what

331
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,949
you're doing some users just want to

332
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,080
browse the web with the best protection

333
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,760
ever and that's the end of it like they

334
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,200
don't want to click anything else but

335
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,930
it's also good to tell and what's going

336
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,589
on decisive visiting some vital some

337
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,689
sites ticular privacy that is in the

338
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,550
core of their mission to protect their

339
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,800
users as well some others not so

340
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,859
providing that transparency on what

341
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,270
you're doing too is important to users

342
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,720
allowing them to control that experience

343
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:59,550
is important too you shouldn't just

344
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,830
decide what users do it you should allow

345
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,990
them to control what it's best for them

346
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,100
and to give them choice and control and

347
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,630
choice is different you might give them

348
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,730
control on whether they like dark bread

349
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:17,430
or light red but you're not giving the

350
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:19,200
much choice of color and extensions that

351
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,989
provide real privacy are really

352
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,029
important

353
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:28,250
some of them provide you with that you

354
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:32,310
know Firefox tor brave for time being

355
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:36,300
but chrome would manifest v3 is gonna

356
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:38,719
really really really make it hard for

357
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,670
extensions to provide really meaningful

358
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,210
privacy and Safari doesn't even

359
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:48,870
allow you to do the song anyway so that

360
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:51,120
is a reality why is this important

361
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,430
the Internet is a very diverse you

362
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,270
cannot account for every threat out

363
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:59,010
there you cannot expect that even with

364
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,860
all the money you're gonna protect

365
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,319
everyone from actually every threat what

366
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,630
you can do is do your best and provide

367
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,610
ways for users to have other tools

368
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,590
there's other organizations there's

369
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,630
other users that are fighting different

370
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,670
threat vectors and if you allow them to

371
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,590
have those tools they can protect

372
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:18,810
themselves also from the ones that you

373
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:21,270
haven't thought about if you remove

374
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,910
those choices then users are at the

375
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:30,930
mercy of what you think and think of

376
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:33,600
what you're thinking think of so you can

377
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:37,560
start seeing a trend that most browsers

378
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,240
are taking privacy seriously privacy as

379
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:44,250
core of their mission to their users

380
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,410
where they are serving the users they're

381
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,780
not serving advertisers they're not

382
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,329
serving someone else's way of making

383
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:54,390
money they're serving the users and then

384
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,980
you can figure out the the rest on how

385
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,960
to make money on things if you want to

386
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,000
bring that part of the conversation but

387
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:07,350
you cannot say that privacy is not as

388
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,410
important as an industry price is hard

389
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:13,169
yes but there are easy lifts if you

390
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,680
ignore the those you're missing the

391
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,760
point

392
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,990
if privacy is too hard for you to try

393
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,819
maybe don't get involved in making a

394
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:25,470
browser ads doesn't mean that they're

395
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,569
always tracking theirs as a respect

396
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,970
users privacy it's releasing these

397
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:32,129
conversations to hear that all but you

398
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,550
know it like we need for content from

399
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,140
free content we need ads maybe but that

400
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,300
doesn't mean you have to have tracking

401
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,830
on them or that you have to remove the

402
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,530
choice or users to have their privacy

403
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:47,270
respected money doesn't make it okay to

404
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:49,440
violate our rights some challenges are

405
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,090
providing privacy while having good

406
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,370
browsing experience there is a hard

407
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,070
challenge but almost every browser out

408
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,350
there is trying to do

409
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,689
best there are actually putting privacy

410
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,030
protections while figuring out where

411
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:06,080
what's the best level to not break the

412
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:07,940
web you know we've seen that more

413
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,399
tractors blogs you even have faster and

414
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,770
less noisy browsing too aggressively it

415
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,370
might break the friction allottee you

416
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,490
have to let users choice choose pricey

417
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,560
versus security some companies have

418
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,690
invested a lot in security a lot of

419
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,760
security and that is great for the

420
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,470
entire ecosystem but when we talk about

421
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,160
security and privacy sometimes we see

422
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,930
them as different things and security is

423
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,810
a priority for everyone and sometimes

424
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:37,340
for some browsers price is not but price

425
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,460
it can be security as well for some

426
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,379
users there's certain information that

427
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,350
can put me at risk in certain regions of

428
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:49,040
the world or in the community I live in

429
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,149
and exposing that part of my life which

430
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,360
puts me at risk

431
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:55,280
security is intertwined with privacy

432
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,889
they're not a separate thing you have to

433
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,389
see them as as companions because if

434
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,340
you're not seeing that part you're

435
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,750
missing on a large portion of your users

436
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:09,230
and you're putting a big big size of the

437
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:12,440
ecosystem at risk so users shouldn't be

438
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:14,810
forced to choose this is not about which

439
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,030
browser you should choose or which one

440
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:18,560
you shouldn't you shouldn't be forced to

441
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,910
choose between browsers because which

442
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,129
one offers more security and more

443
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,900
privacy you should be choosing for other

444
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,260
things all of them should be used

445
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,600
offering you security and privacy well

446
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:33,440
so what can you do the internet needs to

447
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,939
be an opt-in world not an opt-out you

448
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,160
need to think about that when you design

449
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,130
systems especially when you design

450
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,980
browsers you need to think about the

451
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:45,560
defaults and the default security and

452
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,260
privacy should be the most important

453
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,480
thing if you're not providing those

454
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,390
defaults you're not serving your users

455
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,220
you're not doing a good job you need to

456
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,880
do as a user also you need to demand

457
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,110
better

458
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,900
you shouldn't have to choose between

459
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,750
service and security and your voice does

460
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,670
have power you just need to be heard

461
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,670
don't think because you're just a single

462
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:09,290
person among millions or billions that

463
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,440
you do not have power if

464
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,930
we all push for better for a better

465
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,060
experience and for to be better serviced

466
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,590
by the browser's if we do it all

467
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,929
together we'll we'll get a better

468
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:24,970
service you're not alone and we shall

469
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,970
get our privacy back thank you
