1
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:19,509
I don't want you all to trust me that's

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,210
we're talking about trustworthy

3
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:24,160
elections and my purpose here in this

4
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,019
talk is to convince you about a couple

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,730
of techniques that can be used to

6
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,709
improve the trustworthiness of elections

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,090
and a few challenges that are holding us

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,159
back today

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,079
what I'm trying to get across by saying

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:36,159
don't trust me is that I'm hoping to

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,079
prevent it present you with some

12
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,030
evidence around these things I'm not

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,440
hoping to convince you that I'm an

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:46,809
expert in that you should believe me so

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,599
Trust is built through evidence and

16
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:51,578
every election produces evidence there's

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,809
a whole list of things that we can take

18
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,140
into account when we're thinking about

19
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:59,289
why we should trust an election the

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,760
question for any individual task is is

21
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:03,489
this enough evidence that I can actually

22
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,190
trust the election to take an example

23
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:08,440
myself if somebody presented me with the

24
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,570
source code for an election I might

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,158
review that source code I might gain

26
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,979
some degree of trust that that source

27
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,610
code is actually doing what I would hope

28
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:20,408
that it's doing for an election at the

29
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,329
end of the day though that wouldn't be

30
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:24,189
enough evidence on its own for me to

31
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:25,509
trust an election system even if

32
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,548
somebody told me that that election

33
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,890
system is using that source code there's

34
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,540
no real great way unless they provide

35
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,520
further evidence for me to be sure that

36
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,259
that code is what's running if you take

37
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,560
somebody else that doesn't have the

38
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:40,420
ability to audit source code

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,590
open-sourcing might give them a little

40
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,840
bit of evidence it might help a little

41
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,770
bit with their confidence but it would

42
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,990
help them less than it would help me so

43
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,149
that's one of a whole range of things

44
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,429
that sort of combine to give evidence

45
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:58,240
for a correct election I've listed a few

46
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,820
on this slide but everybody again takes

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,250
into account what they believe when

48
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:07,449
they're thinking about elections so this

49
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:10,119
is by no means a complete list so if I'm

50
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,670
running an election what should my goal

51
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,350
be my goal should be that everyone who

52
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,988
votes should be able to trust the

53
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,858
outcome of an election this is sort of

54
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:22,450
the perfect world example and so who out

55
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:26,500
there sort of believes we live in a

56
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,970
perfect world - all right so nobody

57
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,910
raised their hands if you if you can't

58
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,380
see the audience

59
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,290
I also you know I I agree with that

60
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,100
assessment I don't know if this is an

61
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,060
achievable goal if this idea of everyone

62
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,570
voting and being able to trust the

63
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,420
elections is achievable and I know for

64
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,709
certain that there's no solution in

65
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,470
existence that is capable of achieving

66
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,510
this at the scale we need for elections

67
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,180
this is this is an open question how we

68
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,549
achieve this goal of sort of universal

69
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,250
trust but I also know there are

70
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,170
thousands of people working every day to

71
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,380
move us in this direction we have

72
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,950
everything from County IT to election

73
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,810
activists to large corporations a lot of

74
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,369
people are working together on trying to

75
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,260
chip away at this problem and move us

76
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,740
closer and it's really a testament to

77
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,420
the importance of the problem as well as

78
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,920
the will of those people that they keep

79
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,630
at it because Elections is a

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,760
particularly challenging area these

81
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,609
challenges exist both in in the

82
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,570
technical and the political space I'm

83
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,160
going to mostly set the political side

84
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,900
aside but remember that for every

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,390
technical solution you can present to

86
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,490
elections the political side of things

87
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,709
exist as a multiplier and the challenge

88
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,270
of implementing those so if everything

89
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,910
today seems hard just imagine

90
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,450
multiplying that by I'm not gonna give a

91
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,799
number but a quite a significant factor

92
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,329
and on the technical side I'm gonna make

93
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,440
an assessment and I look forward to

94
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,240
disagreeing with some of you that have

95
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,010
spent time thinking about elections I'm

96
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,840
gonna make an assessment on what I see

97
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,049
is the most you know the single biggest

98
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,450
challenge in in presenting elections

99
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,680
systems and and maybe it's not if not

100
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,140
the single biggest it's one of the most

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,570
unique challenges and that is ballot

102
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,089
secrecy and ballot secrecy is really

103
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,769
unique for elections because it requires

104
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,320
that nobody can figure out how anybody

105
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,570
else voted not only that it requires

106
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,640
that even if the voter themselves wants

107
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,270
to reveal how they voted they're unable

108
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:32,729
to do so which no other system that I'm

109
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:34,289
aware of has this property without

110
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,970
ballot secrecy so if we set this

111
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,250
requirement a ballot secrecy aside it's

112
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,520
actually really easy to have an election

113
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,710
that every voter is able to trust we can

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,070
just publish all of the people's names

115
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,289
next to the way that they voted so this

116
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,730
allows this allows somebody to actually

117
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,900
go to the list and they can look at the

118
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,060
list and they say oh great

119
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,169
I'm person 1 and I voted a this is

120
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,840
exactly what I expected it also allows

121
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,540
somebody to look and maybe catch that

122
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,590
something went wrong fortunately in this

123
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,850
case if we if we kept the if we kept all

124
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,109
of the user information around they

125
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,340
would actually be able to go and redo

126
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:16,470
their vote but this is sort of this is

127
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,419
this is the slide that represents the

128
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,770
massive downside the downside that's so

129
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,960
great that we can't take this approach

130
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,409
we can have conversations like this

131
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,989
where a friend a government somebody

132
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,120
that that we don't like can ask us why

133
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,800
we didn't vote in a certain way or they

134
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,200
could try to pay us to vote in a certain

135
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,690
way and in any any country that takes

136
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,909
its democracy seriously this is an

137
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,460
unacceptable threat so publishing

138
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,050
election data while very trustworthy in

139
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,150
some sense and for some people is

140
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:51,750
nowhere close to trustworthy for

141
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:53,580
everybody so this is this is a more

142
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,680
ideal solution where we have all of the

143
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,680
votes they've been accurately recorded

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,300
but they've been separated from people

145
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,900
the way that we accomplish this today is

146
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:06,510
that we separate out people from their

147
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,669
electronic records or from their paper

148
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,950
ballots at the polling place so when

149
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,740
somebody signs in we no longer keep

150
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,390
track of who they are but we use

151
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,750
physical mechanisms to ensure that they

152
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,750
can only cast a single valid vote we can

153
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,060
also do this in mail-in voting like we

154
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,650
have in Oregon and Washington by having

155
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,170
a separate signature page from a ballot

156
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,929
page we compare those all and then we

157
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:34,230
separate and shuffle the ballots before

158
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,700
counting them we don't know of any way

159
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,560
to do this electronically and we

160
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,060
definitely don't know fully

161
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,980
electronically without a paper record

162
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,380
and we don't know of any way whatsoever

163
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,480
to do this fully electronically in such

164
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,250
a way that trust can be provided so even

165
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,710
if a company did something like this and

166
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,090
said sure send me your user name send me

167
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,919
your vote and I promise I'm going to

168
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,330
separate those there's no way for them

169
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,550
to provide evidence that they've done

170
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,390
that separation and there's also no way

171
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,550
for them to provide

172
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:00,990
evidence that maybe they have done it

173
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,850
but they also kept another record in the

174
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,160
background so everything I'm talking

175
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,630
about today has the hard requirement of

176
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,070
a paper backup

177
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,550
that voters are able to verify

178
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,550
themselves so I'm going to discuss this

179
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,340
first technique that can be used to

180
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,050
improve the security and improved the

181
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,669
sort of feelings of trust around

182
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,400
elections and that's called risk

183
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,570
limiting audits to understand the goal

184
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,450
of risk limiting audits we're gonna go

185
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:30,030
through a little game sort of between me

186
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,909
and you you all get to be an election

187
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,830
official and your goal as an election

188
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,000
official is to ensure the public that an

189
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:40,380
election has been run correctly I

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,680
unrealistically get to be a bad guy for

191
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:46,170
a little while I'm quite a good guy so

192
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,510
on the screen we see a representation of

193
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,990
a paper trail think of it as a huge

194
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:53,219
stack of papers all stacked up in boxes

195
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,050
you're an election official and you

196
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,860
don't have unlimited time and you don't

197
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,300
have unlimited money but your goal is to

198
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,680
examine this in some way that gives you

199
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,000
the maximum amount of trust or an

200
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,860
acceptable amount of trust that the

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,180
election has been run correctly so if

202
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,530
you were to look at one of these things

203
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,930
you would see that it's either blue or

204
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,940
orange in this game I have the power to

205
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,040
report whatever election outcome I want

206
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,170
it so we can assume that I've taken over

207
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,840
the reporting system and I get to say

208
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:21,090
either red one or orange one or blue one

209
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,580
and I also get to say by how much they

210
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,440
won we call this the margin this margin

211
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,030
is represented as a percentage of the

212
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,040
total number of votes in this case and

213
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,780
again your goal is to assure the public

214
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,789
that the winner that I reported is

215
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,380
represented accurately by this paper

216
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,750
trail or to catch me

217
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,700
if I if I lied so I'm gonna give an easy

218
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,429
one for this example I'm gonna say that

219
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,960
blue has won by 90 percent again this is

220
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,729
your paper trail that voters have

221
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,440
verified that represents the actual

222
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,750
votes of the voters and your goal is to

223
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,820
examine some of these in order to figure

224
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,000
out whether I'm telling the truth or not

225
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,310
and a margin of 90% we'd expect about

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,200
we'd expect about two of these to be

227
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,329
orange so you can go ahead and pick one

228
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,650
and you all made a wonderful choice and

229
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:04,020
you picked one and it turned out to be

230
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,720
orange so think about how this makes you

231
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,939
feel about your confidence in this

232
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,550
election being run correctly we said we

233
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,080
would expect about two of these to be or

234
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,880
so that was actually a pretty improbable

235
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,380
choice and now that we've seen this

236
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,420
orange one opened up we're starting to

237
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,830
feel a little bit anxious about whether

238
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,260
their election was running correctly or

239
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,520
not we're not exactly gonna write the

240
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,450
election off as being running correctly

241
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,400
because we could have just gotten

242
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,840
unlucky but we need to keep picking and

243
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,699
we have decreased our confidence a

244
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,500
little so now we're gonna pick another

245
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,730
one and it's great it turned out to be

246
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,710
blue

247
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,380
this helps us feel a little better about

248
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,330
the way that the election is run we feel

249
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,370
a little more confident in the results

250
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,930
that were reported but we definitely

251
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,180
have not gotten all the way to being

252
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,890
able to say yes we believe this has been

253
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:52,079
run correctly so you pick a few more and

254
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,449
in this case with the 90 percent margin

255
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,460
reported we were actually able to sort

256
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,050
of get past to the 90 percent margin so

257
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,790
we've actually we've actually sort of

258
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,650
conclusively in this case shown that the

259
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,599
90 percent is wrong and this is sort of

260
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,709
a this is sort of a fact that was able

261
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,140
to come about because of this small

262
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,820
sample size but in this case what you

263
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,400
would basically do is you'd say I've

264
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,990
sort of lost confidence in the reported

265
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,939
in the reported outcome and we need to

266
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,070
go back and we need to reevaluate the

267
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,450
entire election with a full recount so

268
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,520
if we go ahead and do the full recount

269
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,010
we see that I was lying in the first

270
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,810
place and it looks like orange actually

271
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,370
won but we were able to do the full

272
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,439
recount we were able to catch that and

273
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,780
we are now more confident in our

274
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,060
election results this is normally not

275
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,520
going to be the case we sort of

276
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,689
generally expect that most reported

277
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,400
election results might be correct and we

278
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,920
also are going to have much bigger

279
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:46,050
sample sizes the the purpose of risk

280
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,750
limiting audits is to sort of give you a

281
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,060
tool to understand how certain you

282
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,800
should be so I mentioned as we saw that

283
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,050
orange as we saw that orange ballot

284
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,120
appear we felt less certain risk oh my

285
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,640
god it puts a number on how much less

286
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,830
certain we feel as we saw the blue it

287
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,839
increased our certainty a bit and risk

288
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,910
limiting audits also put a number on

289
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,800
that and in the way that you use a risk

290
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:10,620
living audit is you before you run it

291
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,400
you set an actual number saying I want

292
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:17,400
to be 99.99% sure that the reported

293
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,100
election results match up with the

294
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,230
reality and election risk limiting audit

295
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,830
tells you when you can stop in order to

296
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,830
achieve that goal

297
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,480
so a real election looks a lot more like

298
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,100
this as a sidenote I know this is a

299
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,779
pretty low resolution image but once I

300
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,959
sort of thought about it I had no choice

301
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,850
but to put it up if you if you know what

302
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:41,149
this is you get bonus old Windows user

303
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,649
points so there could be hundreds of

304
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:44,899
thousands of ballots this is sort of a

305
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:46,490
step towards what elections might

306
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:49,670
actually look like if we compare what we

307
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,709
were looking at before but the magic of

308
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,089
risk limiting audits is that you know we

309
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:55,420
mentioned that number is going up and

310
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:58,160
down that number does not go up and down

311
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,529
relative to the total number of ballots

312
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,510
it goes up and down relative only to the

313
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:04,820
margin and to the results you see as you

314
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,069
sample that means that an election with

315
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,320
hundreds of thousands of ballots could

316
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,630
get very high confidence from auditing

317
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,010
only hundreds of ballots this makes the

318
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,750
risk only Nagada it's a wonderful tool

319
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,260
for inexpensively gaining a high degree

320
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,970
of assurance about elections here's the

321
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,380
answer if you didn't know that's the

322
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,180
Windows disk Defragmenter there's one

323
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,459
thing we overlooked so in our game your

324
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,219
goal I I mentioned was to assure the

325
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:32,869
public of the validity of these results

326
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:38,180
yeah you got to choose which elections

327
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:40,100
which ballots to open that we we could

328
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,269
have we could have collaborated and I

329
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,069
could have told you exactly which

330
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,740
ballots were blue beforehand and the

331
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:47,300
public would be left out they would not

332
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,470
have been able to believe that you were

333
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,469
being honest in the way that you

334
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,269
selected your ballots so a critical part

335
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,279
of an audit is to actually make it

336
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:58,459
transparent how you selected the ballots

337
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,889
it's pretty common to have a public dice

338
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:02,839
throwing ceremony before and to feed the

339
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:04,910
output of that through a deterministic

340
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,139
random generator so that any interested

341
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,540
party would actually be able to

342
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:10,519
reproduce your selections and believe

343
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:14,930
that they were made without either my or

344
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,250
your knowledge so now I'm going to talk

345
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,219
about another technique which is called

346
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,019
end-to-end verifiable elections the goal

347
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,329
of end-to-end verifiable elections is to

348
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:24,709
develop a chain of evidence from the

349
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:26,959
moment that the voter casts their vote

350
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:28,310
all the way through the tally this chain

351
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,380
of evidence is meant to be unforgeable

352
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:33,109
meaning that if an end-to-end verifiable

353
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,170
election is run successfully it can

354
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:38,790
guarantee that the election was run

355
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,349
accurately so let's let's think back to

356
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,760
we discussed this sort of version of an

357
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,650
election system where everything is

358
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,510
published this gave us a lot of trust

359
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:48,209
but it was unacceptable from the privacy

360
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,640
standpoint it turns out we didn't need

361
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,650
sort of the full publication of all of

362
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,120
the ballots in order to learn the things

363
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,709
that we wanted there were sort of three

364
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,420
things that we actually wanted to learn

365
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,430
from this we wanted to learn that the

366
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,260
reported total matched up to the reality

367
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,030
so if we went through and added up all

368
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,350
the A's and the B's we want to believe

369
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,140
that that matched up to the reported

370
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,490
total for the election we also wanted to

371
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,830
be sure that every single ballot was

372
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,600
valid so if some person were able to

373
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,670
vote a thousand times for a on one

374
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,590
ballot that would sort of irreversibly

375
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,839
compromise the integrity of the of the

376
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,060
election and finally we cared that for

377
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,430
each individual voter they were able to

378
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,619
look and verify yes my vote was counted

379
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,229
and yes my vote was included in the

380
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,150
tally that we saw at the end of the day

381
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,190
again this is unacceptable for privacy

382
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,800
reasons which is where cryptography

383
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,420
comes in so we rearrange things a bit we

384
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,939
make a column per vote a and a column

385
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,219
for hope B and we encrypt zeros and ones

386
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,660
for each vote so this thing represents

387
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,850
the exact same thing on the previous

388
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,469
page but it maintains privacy we can

389
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,500
think of this function E as a function

390
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,330
that takes takes a 1 or 0

391
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,040
and makes it into something where you

392
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:57,930
can't externally tell if it's a 1 or 0

393
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,910
so now we have our we have our one math

394
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,709
slide and this is about homomorphic

395
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,900
encryption so there's a technique by

396
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,910
which we can take the encryption of X we

397
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,590
can take the encryption of Y we can do

398
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,480
an operation on the two of them and at

399
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,000
the end of the day we have an encryption

400
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,620
on X plus y and while this seems a

401
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,860
little magical to think about it's based

402
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,290
on more or less high school math if you

403
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,330
can imagine that if you can imagine that

404
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,050
exponentiation as we show in this bottom

405
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:26,100
equation is encryption then you can see

406
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,870
how we could actually turn

407
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,730
multiplication into addition on the

408
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,760
values of x and y this is a pretty

409
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,500
standard rule the good news is that you

410
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,090
can actually use exponentiation as

411
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:41,400
encryption but only in very special

412
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:43,770
circumstances so in an election of this

413
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,709
form what we gain from that homomorphic

414
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:49,590
addition is that anybody could reproduce

415
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:52,120
the results you could take the column a

416
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,100
on your own and add it up using

417
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,930
this operation and at the end of the day

418
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,089
you would end up with an encryption of

419
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,040
the election result as reported but

420
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,420
we're missing a step there we need to

421
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,370
believe that that encryption of the

422
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,910
operation is reported actually matches

423
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,430
up to the published results so in order

424
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:12,699
to do that we use a technique called

425
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:14,050
zero knowledge proof so now is where

426
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,430
I've got to stop explaining the

427
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,579
techniques to you because as you can see

428
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,469
this gets a little bit challenging we're

429
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,970
gonna return to our notion of trust and

430
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:23,710
we're gonna think how can something

431
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,820
confusing how can something that the

432
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,510
general public is not going to

433
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:30,040
understand increase trust and this is a

434
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,500
this is a method that we use all the

435
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,969
time we use experts to verify things for

436
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,589
us so in this case if we were

437
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,950
dissatisfied with an election because

438
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:44,770
our favorite politician didn't win would

439
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,260
we be able to trust the election if that

440
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:50,350
politician came forward and said my

441
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:52,720
experts analyze the data and I trust the

442
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,580
results of this competition or of this

443
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,350
election I believe the answer is yes but

444
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:00,430
I would sort of look forward to hearing

445
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,990
opinions on that so to sort of move the

446
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,188
bar forward on this

447
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:10,990
we at gal WA and free and fair galas a

448
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:12,370
large large security company that I work

449
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,319
for and free and fair is a much smaller

450
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:16,178
elections company that I co-founded with

451
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,010
Dan Zimmerman and Joe canary

452
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,449
we worked on this together with

453
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,429
Microsoft and we've actually open

454
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,589
sourced an SDK for these end-to-end

455
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:26,350
verifiable elections and we've done a

456
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,909
lot of work our expertise is very much

457
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,040
in software correctness and security and

458
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,559
we've done a lot of work in designing

459
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,300
election guard to have this end-to-end

460
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,690
property and also to be at the forefront

461
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:40,720
of secure and usable SDKs so why don't

462
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,010
we have these technologies today risk

463
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,900
limiting audits are coming along really

464
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,300
well actually people are working their

465
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,280
butts off to get pilots out there and

466
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,780
risk limiting audits are in an

467
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,129
advantageous position because they can

468
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,270
be tacked on to the end of an election

469
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,740
without any certification or improvable

470
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,780
Colorado for example has been working on

471
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,490
on risk eluding audits for a while and

472
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,129
they have open source software that we

473
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,200
initially developed next democracy work

474
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,610
developed and now it's in the hands of

475
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,050
voting

476
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,570
who is developing a new system called

477
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:12,720
Arlo but we're not seeing this

478
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:15,120
development in end-to-end verifiable

479
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,340
elections are even in sort of software

480
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,590
that feels secure in the way that we'd

481
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,030
want it to and why is this all of our

482
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:24,300
voting machines the majority of our

483
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,899
voting machines were procured after the

484
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,430
challenges of 2000 when hava was was

485
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,830
published this is when all of the

486
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,930
jurisdictions got a lot of funding to

487
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:37,320
buy new systems but we haven't seen a

488
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:39,090
lot of funding since and this is this is

489
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,250
sort of I'm not going to talk about the

490
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,689
reasons for funding I'm gonna sort of

491
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,270
let this side speak for itself but

492
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,130
you've all sort of seen what you can do

493
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,260
for two million dollars and it's not

494
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,630
enough to develop mission critical

495
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:55,170
systems not enough to develop systems

496
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,460
that our country depends on there's

497
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,530
another there's another challenge

498
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,360
outside of funding that's that's easier

499
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,700
to tackle and that's certification

500
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,919
there's this problem of certification

501
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,960
where we've we've gone after

502
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,220
certification for a good reason we want

503
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,060
a process by which we can evaluate

504
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,350
election systems and be sure that

505
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,940
they're safe that's what we've been

506
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,520
talking about this whole time the point

507
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,350
of certification is trust the reality is

508
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,600
that the system is challenging enough

509
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:24,060
that it's eroding trust by making it

510
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,120
expensive and slow to update our

511
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,590
election systems so we can look we the

512
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,659
elections community can look towards

513
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,129
communities like the cryptography

514
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,380
community who has been starting to push

515
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,660
things forward this architecture we see

516
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,950
is an example of something that NIST is

517
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,140
done for its FIPS algorithm

518
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,120
certification where they've taken a slow

519
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,010
manual process of emailing test cases

520
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,280
back and forth and turned it into an

521
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:49,860
automated communication between a client

522
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,330
and a server that's run by NIST so this

523
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,159
has made things quite a bit cheaper and

524
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,050
quite a bit faster and if we're able to

525
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,540
do the same sort of thing for elections

526
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:59,850
we'll be able to allow for quicker

527
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,680
evolution of election systems will allow

528
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,149
for new entrants into the market

529
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,300
currently there's only five companies

530
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,590
with certified systems and one or two of

531
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,200
those controls the majority of the

532
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,179
market share and we will be able to

533
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,480
allow even those companies to improve

534
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,250
their systems quicker so I'm going to

535
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,140
quickly go over what we can do I'm

536
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,539
talking to a group of people who is

537
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,129
probably

538
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:23,499
already done more for elections than

539
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:26,080
they know our everyday security efforts

540
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:28,629
affect elections officials every day

541
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,210
they're dealing with ransomware they're

542
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:32,320
dealing with reliability problems

543
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,529
they're dealing with browser security

544
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,269
problems then we can talk to our local

545
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:39,700
government San Francisco is making huge

546
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,830
strides in improving election security

547
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,999
through open source election system and

548
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,799
if you're interested in to end

549
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:46,989
verifiable elections check out election

550
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,820
guard you can actually write verifiers

551
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:49,840
for the evidence we produce and we would

552
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,789
assert that this could take an

553
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,559
undergraduate about a week to write so

554
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:55,269
it's a really fun project to get engaged

555
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,070
with elections and we'd love to hear

556
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:59,830
from you if you're able to make progress

557
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,689
on this or if you need help finally

558
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,728
think about certification in whatever

559
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,440
field you're in and reach out if you

560
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:07,629
think you have an understanding of how

561
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,889
things can be improved elections is not

562
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:10,899
the only space that's struggling with

563
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:13,209
certification and it's one of the least

564
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:15,039
well-funded spaces so it can really

565
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,570
serve it as an example to sort of push

566
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,259
the bar forward for everybody

567
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:22,389
that's struggling with certification and

568
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:23,830
so stay engaged to reach out if you have

569
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:25,119
ideas reach out if you have questions

570
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,449
and I look forward to hearing some

571
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:27,449
questions

572
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,380
