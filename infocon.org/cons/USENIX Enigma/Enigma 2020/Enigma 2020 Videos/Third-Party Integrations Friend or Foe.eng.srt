1
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,740
good morning welcome to this other

2
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,160
people's code talk dropping speaker

3
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,650
number two we just heard from Filippo

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,250
talking about the challenges of taking

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,450
code from elsewhere via software

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,390
dependencies and trying to run them

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,579
internally and how to be able to do risk

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,579
assessment on that but maybe you don't

9
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:40,600
use software dependencies I don't know

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,280
we're gonna switch tracks a little bit

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,180
we're instead of talking about software

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,320
dependencies we're gonna talk about

13
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:49,120
vendor dependencies Who am I I don't

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,070
usually do speakers background slides

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,720
but I think it's kind of important to

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,300
explain a bit of the angle that I am

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,589
approaching with this presentation so

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,779
I've been asked where as you've heard

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:01,090
around five years all of InfoSec org I'm

20
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,820
on the privacy engineering team my

21
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:06,570
day-to-day is generally working on

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,640
engineering projects and tasks revolving

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,860
data flow and data access I've also

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,780
spent four of those years participating

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,149
as part of a vendor security committee a

26
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,270
program reviewing requests that come in

27
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:21,940
for potential vendors just by a security

28
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,350
standpoint people often ask me why I'm

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,649
interested in vendor security some

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,479
people call it boring security and my

31
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,250
answer is that I since I come from an

32
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,620
academic background this whole like

33
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,200
forms and paperwork and process piece of

34
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,900
info sack is very interesting to me and

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,780
the second reason is I think looking at

36
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,970
vendor security more deeply really ties

37
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,680
into my aim and my goal of trying to

38
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:48,250
understand how data flows in and out of

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,049
a company's infrastructure you can also

40
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,670
follow me on Twitter you feel free to

41
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:53,619
take pictures of slides and tweet at me

42
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,140
my Twitter handle should be at the

43
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,270
bottom of every slide I do plan to leave

44
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,350
a few minutes for Q&A but for those of

45
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,179
you who hate microphones or otherwise

46
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,699
prefer more insert synchronous form of

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,369
communication this is the alternative

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,378
okay vendors let's talk about vendors if

49
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:10,179
any of you have tried making a Google

50
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,189
search about third-party vendors and

51
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,170
should we worry about them or not you'll

52
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:16,000
start seeing results like this basically

53
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,768
stresses to folks that maybe you should

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,400
be really trying to keep an eye on them

55
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:23,379
whatever that means or somehow be able

56
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,340
to figure out a way to manage that risk

57
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:28,899
why is that I want to tell you a story

58
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,200
this is a story of the perspective of an

59
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,020
inch

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,670
just trying to do their job and ending

61
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,319
up in the thorny edges of security

62
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:41,950
despite all good intentions this is Bob

63
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:44,130
hi Bob one day Bob receives an alert

64
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,899
take it from the local security team

65
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,670
because it turns out the automated

66
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,150
security system detected unauthorized

67
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,309
access from a service that he owns

68
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,269
connecting to the internet thankfully

69
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,910
there were systems to deny this

70
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,920
automatically but Bob is looking closer

71
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,329
and realizing that this in fact might be

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,738
a valid domain to talk to the outside

73
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:08,890
world why is that he says well it says

74
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:12,069
company - CDN comm and I work at company

75
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,708
comm so probably we use company - CDN

76
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,690
comm so maybe this is okay maybe there

77
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,230
was a change that was not properly

78
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,299
communicated so Bob goes to chat with

79
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:26,940
her with his coworker tell us about this

80
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:33,870
bob says hey note see alice is like what

81
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,870
we don't use no TV use notif mm-hmm

82
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,260
Bob makes the decision to whitelist

83
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,910
notes see anyway because you know it

84
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,100
probably belongs to their company is

85
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,459
probably a company asset what harm could

86
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:49,420
there be

87
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:51,040
so he's like sure allow it oh no Bob so

88
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,130
what happened next let's fast forward a

89
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,459
few days here's a very heavily edited

90
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,609
edited conversation from the engineering

91
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,350
team a few days later the TLDR is that

92
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,670
upon prompting from a customer they

93
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,500
discovered that there was some anomalous

94
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,208
behavior occurring in the team services

95
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,829
they were causing changes to customer

96
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,480
accounts and despite the auditing

97
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,840
systems in place they couldn't figure

98
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,850
out why these actions were happening the

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,930
logs would say like half the story there

100
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,039
were so clearly some other things

101
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,840
happening behind the scenes but they

102
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,209
just were like something weird is going

103
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,950
on

104
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:26,680
thankfully they discovered it was due to

105
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:29,260
a red team attack but let's walk through

106
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,800
the the post mortem as to the timeline

107
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:34,650
of events of what happened here so I've

108
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,120
got split here red team blue team

109
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,030
so what happened is the red team tried

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,030
to do some kind of domain fronting event

111
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,369
the main fronting attacked that trigger

112
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,719
the access alert that Bob received Bob's

113
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,150
like yeah whatever I'll whitelist it

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,920
anyway and then so when the attacker

115
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,440
tries to do the domain domain fronting

116
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,490
attack again they succeed so then

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,380
they're able to download some external

118
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,550
tools because at this point you know

119
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,590
they can download whatever they want

120
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,060
from the internet they're able to

121
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,130
conduct their targeted attack which is

122
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,610
that conversation you saw a few days

123
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,380
later they because this is a Red Team

124
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,490
exercise they're like you know it's kind

125
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,170
of weird that nobody has noticed

126
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,730
anything before so let's call support

127
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,060
and really try and light some fire under

128
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,530
these engineers so they call support the

129
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,350
inche team starts investigating the

130
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,539
inche team starts escalating the InfoSec

131
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,980
teamster is involved and pulled in and

132
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,380
then that's when we call off the red

133
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,470
team exercise was clear the red team at

134
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,420
the rate team was very effective here

135
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,280
and that's why we had and we had this

136
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,830
whole process but I was good to find the

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,400
holes here I will note that there was a

138
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,750
very very contrived attack example maybe

139
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,340
not many of you in the room go and have

140
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,890
irrigated with red team's to target very

141
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,080
specific setups and scenarios to

142
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,820
basically prove a point in this case

143
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,580
they required that the higher red team

144
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,409
had to be briefed on where and what to

145
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,680
look and it required that the red team

146
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,050
be given some initial kind of cookie or

147
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,000
like initial access or initial into the

148
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,470
system who arias Lee enough this ties

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,230
really well into filippo South because

150
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,270
the way that they did so was through

151
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,840
custom modifications of a application

152
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:14,799
dependency so we we know what happened

153
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,950
there

154
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,620
and so that was from the previous talk

155
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,390
so complex for a team but could

156
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,160
something it could there be a simpler

157
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,830
scenario like of this that could happen

158
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,570
in real life

159
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,969
so let's talk about an example with

160
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:34,540
target and the HVAC company for those of

161
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,100
you who remember in 2014 there were some

162
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,010
hackers who basically were able to

163
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:41,530
scrape a bunch of payment data from

164
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:44,250
target through an in via the HVAC

165
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,599
company that target was contracted with

166
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,190
they first broke in using network

167
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,840
credentials that were stolen from the

168
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,150
HVAC contractor the

169
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,130
question everyone asked was why did

170
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,620
target give the HVAC company access to

171
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,930
the payments network that seems like two

172
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,430
systems you should not put together the

173
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,560
answer is that the vendor needed to be

174
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,350
able to remote login to the system to do

175
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,550
things like maintenance after the

176
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,290
systems were compromised

177
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,150
the attacker proceeded to then upload

178
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,490
their malicious software because they

179
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,810
now head it into the network the

180
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,870
software started collecting all of the

181
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,430
cards all of the credit cards and then

182
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,590
more interesting is how the data then

183
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,880
got off those systems some early

184
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,010
reporting suggested that they were

185
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,159
pulled off via FTP to some locations in

186
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,719
Russia but actually they found that they

187
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,760
were transmitted to other already hacked

188
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,800
systems they produce presumably the

189
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,360
hacker had already popped elsewhere in

190
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,110
the world or an example they had was a

191
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,370
business in Miami or a server in Brazil

192
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,470
okay so here we have some pretty

193
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,650
convincing arguments that working with

194
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,940
these external integrations there's a

195
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,530
bunch of potential problems there's a

196
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,900
bunch of potential dangers so you might

197
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,090
be asking yourself why do we even bother

198
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,120
to try and work with these what is even

199
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,369
the point of this talk the example I

200
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,470
have is pretty near and dear to my heart

201
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,580
because I work at this company I work

202
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,660
for square if you didn't know what

203
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,789
square is Square is a payments company

204
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,010
it turns out when you need to physically

205
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:09,289
when you need payments to go and fiends

206
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:11,270
to flow you need to engage in

207
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,729
communications with major card brands in

208
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,500
our example Visa and MasterCard all of

209
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,210
you probably have a Visa or MasterCard

210
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,070
credit card in your wallet it is not

211
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,138
gonna work on a square point-of-sale

212
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:25,190
system if we do not work with Visa and

213
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:26,510
MasterCard and so that would if we broke

214
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,830
off those connections that would totally

215
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,639
defeat the purpose of us being a

216
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:35,029
payments facilitator so okay we have to

217
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,380
use vendors but you may be saying don't

218
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:39,110
we already have security and legal

219
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,630
processes in place why why aren't these

220
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,740
working how do these processes fail so

221
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,220
I'm going to walk you through a little

222
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,570
bit of behind the scenes of what it me

223
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,890
will look like to what it would look

224
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,540
like in most companies to establish a

225
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:53,120
vendor relationship some of these may be

226
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,849
familiar to you in the audience some of

227
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,860
them may not be so let's pretend here we

228
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,660
have a company and a third party here's

229
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,160
some business unit somewhere that wants

230
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,930
to make use of a vendor that bend over

231
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,760
there there is usually some kind of

232
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,250
centralized procurement department which

233
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,140
handles all all incoming vendor in

234
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,010
requests you can think of your of this

235
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,300
department as a project or process or

236
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,010
some kind of project process management

237
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,380
team they manage and maintain requests

238
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,120
from all of the various business units

239
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,980
and they ensure that these requests make

240
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,670
sense and are properly vetted by the

241
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,070
different departments one really clear

242
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,270
example of why they're needed here is

243
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,310
that if you have two business units

244
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,930
wanting to use the same vendor the

245
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,390
procurement department may be able to

246
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,579
negotiate a deal you have like bulk

247
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,740
discounts or wrong discounts making sure

248
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,390
the contract is centralized making an

249
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,410
inholding each business unit accountable

250
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:48,029
for the costs for the fastest to move

251
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,709
forward the procurement team usually has

252
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:52,740
to check with both illegal and InfoSec

253
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:54,660
department life in the InfoSec boxes as

254
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,730
follows we ask for documents we ask for

255
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,430
questionnaires we're maybe receive half

256
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,670
of them we read like several hundred

257
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,779
sock to type two-page reports and then

258
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,790
based on that we try and make a risk

259
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,740
assessment assessment and provide risk

260
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,959
guidance as to whether or not it's safe

261
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,330
to move forward with the vendor any

262
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,310
items goes back to info real talent the

263
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:17,070
contract how does I maintain the

264
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,839
contract look like the common one is

265
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,040
using a data processing agreement so

266
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,660
that you can help mitigate risk if

267
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,699
there's potential data exposure

268
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,170
once that son procurement talks to

269
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,390
finance or Accounts Payable to actually

270
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,979
pay the vendor with the legal end beam

271
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,350
attached and now that's all done

272
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,350
welcome to the boring world of vending

273
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,350
so okay now the business unit can engage

274
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,479
with the engineering team are we done

275
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,950
maybe well you know despite all the

276
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,930
behind the scenes process we still need

277
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,910
to actually tie the engineering team to

278
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,229
like talk to that vendor and in fact by

279
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,060
the time it hits engineering teams it

280
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,620
looks like this and the engineering team

281
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,599
has no idea what has happened behind the

282
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,430
scenes unaware of all of those existing

283
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,470
discussions all are unaware of the three

284
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,599
months of paperwork for paperwork

285
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,089
pushing in emails so from their point of

286
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,670
view like they're like cool I make a

287
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:08,100
link I'm done but you might be asking

288
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:10,529
yourselves well does the engineering

289
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,420
team know what data is or is not a lot

290
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,570
to be sent where is the security

291
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,170
oversight this is why a lot of companies

292
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:20,320
loop in a security team

293
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,969
perform some kind of design review or a

294
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,100
design or an architectural review the

295
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,950
involving the integration with the

296
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,120
third-party but it's also important to

297
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,860
remember that the actual communication

298
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,839
stream is still managed by the

299
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,740
engineering team themselves and

300
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,490
especially when you have a service

301
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,440
talking tomorrow

302
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,750
multiple third parties the security or

303
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,190
may not be able to see this nice diagram

304
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,019
they may not be able to see what the

305
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,640
other tangent risks are unless the

306
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:46,959
engineering team happens to bring those

307
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,240
up to the security org so after all that

308
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,459
and they've blabbered on for a bit

309
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,170
problem number one we come to our first

310
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,939
technical concern which is how do we

311
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,300
ensure that we don't have unfettered

312
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,920
outbound access a solution of many of

313
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,810
you may be familiar with is implementing

314
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,269
a whitelist system to control outbound

315
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,180
access the common way of doing this is

316
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:09,010
via a proxy or firewall and then

317
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,750
engineers can submit changeless requests

318
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,189
to update what is whitelisted and then

319
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:16,440
anything that's not allowed is the night

320
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:18,820
access but then when it comes down to

321
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,130
periodically auditing these although

322
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,019
even reviewing them as they come in the

323
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,820
domains and the IP addresses sometimes

324
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,130
make it really difficult to understand

325
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,410
what you know what external third-party

326
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,959
it's actually referring to so like all

327
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:34,060
the four names on this list you probably

328
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,609
only recognize two of them and me as an

329
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:40,029
insider at the company called square I

330
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,550
also only understand two of them it's

331
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:45,939
like what is the VP see - example - yes

332
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,109
- Francois Amazon AWS that I have no

333
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,540
idea

334
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,250
it's probably an AWS I can figure out

335
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,839
that much is that something hosted by us

336
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,079
is something hosted by someone else who

337
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,370
knows the other big problem is that is

338
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,529
actually hard to reason about which

339
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,209
services within the company are actually

340
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,220
allowed to access specific vendor

341
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,449
endpoints you may have a manually

342
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,120
generated service map that looks like

343
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:09,189
this but in the white list this is all

344
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,050
you see I mean it's like I have a list

345
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,529
of things they are white listed and I

346
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,300
hope everything is fine so we come to

347
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,610
technical problem number two which is we

348
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,560
have lack of vendor integration context

349
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,870
so when it comes down to performing

350
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,000
reviews or audits even if you have a

351
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,160
good like every three months cycle of

352
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,670
reviewing what's on this enormous list

353
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,530
you have so how variable to know

354
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,790
contacts for the integration so what we

355
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,380
did was we decided we were going to be a

356
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,339
bit more proactive about doesn't see

357
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,439
what we could do to improve this

358
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,240
situation and so let's look at the

359
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,950
original problem the first step here is

360
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,220
that we want to tie vendors to AB

361
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,890
somehow we have our service map that

362
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,210
looks like this let's simplify a little

363
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,569
bit to see what that technically looks

364
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:54,180
like simplify it more and so it's very

365
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,710
simple form base form we have a

366
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,170
relationship between the application and

367
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,730
the domain it needs access to that's

368
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,319
really great but it doesn't solve the

369
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,050
problem of knowing what the domain is

370
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,970
associated with in terms of like what

371
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,819
vendor is it attached to so let's see we

372
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,900
can extend these models a bit better

373
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,120
instead of having the app tied to the

374
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,189
domain directly we actually want them to

375
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,780
be tied to the vendor and actually if we

376
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,310
consider the vendor to be a company a

377
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,199
company could have multiple different

378
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:23,280
products each with their own sets of

379
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:26,340
domains so one example might be Google

380
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,160
has like pub sup which is separate from

381
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:31,050
I think they have stock driver and those

382
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,480
are totally different like use cases

383
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,599
totally different domains you don't want

384
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,340
to kind of mix those together it would

385
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,530
be super nice to capture as to why

386
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,140
different apps need access to these

387
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,329
different products so we some somehow

388
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,240
need to attach some of data to that kind

389
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:50,220
of product and app relationship so we

390
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,900
can create an integration model here and

391
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,080
what does that integration model contain

392
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,360
it contains it can be tied in to things

393
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,850
like design Docs or ticket IDs or

394
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,030
whatever fun review process system you

395
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,710
have we'd also like to use this as an

396
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,439
opportunity to add relationships to

397
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,830
particularly DRI so either an original

398
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,130
user or a group or team or role that is

399
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,650
responsible okay so we have this nice

400
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:20,400
model diagram down what does that look

401
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:23,760
like in practice so this is a screenshot

402
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,290
from from a dev environment of me

403
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,810
generating this but this is something we

404
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:31,500
have been working on over the past

405
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:33,270
you're in a bit and instead of having

406
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,860
that laundry list of domains that I

407
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:37,260
showed earlier we now have a lot more

408
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,370
contextual information we have this is

409
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,530
the view from kind of the application

410
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,870
you can see the contextual information

411
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,630
on the vendors and the products

412
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,400
I use it can contain a short thing a

413
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,740
thing like a short pluribus to why we

414
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,569
have integration what is the description

415
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,430
of the data being transferred what are

416
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,430
the domains tied to it and what the

417
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,779
approval state of each integration is

418
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,930
and you might be saying your to yourself

419
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,939
did I just hear her say you know the

420
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,829
review state or the state of approval

421
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,660
and you are right

422
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,490
that's because any new integrations that

423
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,810
need to go that go through the system

424
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,970
need to go through review as part of

425
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,099
vendor security before they are approved

426
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,930
and before the whitelist is enabled for

427
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,820
them so when adding a domain the first

428
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,189
thing to ask is is a part of an existing

429
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,860
vendor is it a new vendor if it's part

430
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,960
of an existing veter then you need to

431
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,010
make requests to change the domain or IP

432
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,210
list so that and that way InfoSec can

433
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,650
jump in and say okay this is actually

434
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,790
belong to this vendor maybe actually

435
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,699
want a new and new vendor and you want

436
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:38,209
to start a new vendor relationship

437
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,490
that's a lot of words um okay so if you

438
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:44,290
go back then to Bob and thinking about

439
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:47,839
him making that change to allow node C

440
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,900
instead of Bob here got Auto denied

441
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,010
initially we now have an automatic

442
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,750
technical security check so if he wants

443
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,689
to enable it you know someone from

444
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,730
vendor security comes by and says hey

445
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,440
why are you making this change would be

446
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,860
nice if you could provide some more

447
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,110
information could you could you please

448
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,939
document your change put it in this nice

449
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,479
little form and then everyone will be

450
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:14,150
happy and so Bob is able to do that and

451
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,890
with the supplementary documentation the

452
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,670
vendor security person runs away and

453
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:22,100
says yeah everything is fine get to

454
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,189
approval or you know name you need to do

455
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:27,188
more investigation and then so instead

456
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:30,020
of this whole attack as I showed before

457
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,300
we now like dump that whole top piece

458
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,280
and hopefully in engineering investigate

459
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,600
sooner and then we can identify the red

460
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:40,910
team serum so is this it have we solved

461
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,860
everything is this magical UI system

462
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:46,100
really the solution to all of our vendor

463
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,840
security woes I think there's still a

464
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,540
lot of future work to be done in this

465
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,399
space that is still very very simplistic

466
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,220
in terms of all we need to do is manage

467
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,620
assets

468
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,390
and in fact a bunch of this feature work

469
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,620
is one of the reasons why I'm so on

470
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,230
privacy engineering and I still have a

471
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,149
job some things to think about it'd be

472
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,400
nice if we could do some deep analysis

473
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,770
of egress of things exiting our system

474
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,230
it'd be nice to do some schema analysis

475
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,150
or tagging data types in the data

476
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,309
exiting the system it'd be nice to throw

477
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,159
an alert if there's not a change in how

478
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:20,408
much data is going up but a change in

479
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,970
certain types of data going out and

480
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,980
there's probably a myriad more problems

481
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,350
that I haven't thought of that I'm happy

482
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,990
to talk more with the audience after

483
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:30,340
this these are going to be the kinds of

484
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,309
things we're thinking about throughout

485
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,559
this year into next year and with that

486
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,990
thank you for listening I'm happy to

487
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:42,180
take questions at this time

488
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,180
[Applause]
