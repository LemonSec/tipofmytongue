1
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,540
good afternoon and welcome to the last

2
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:23,150
session I will be continuing talking

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,410
about cybercrime the previous two talks

4
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:29,360
before lunch

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:31,430
they kind of motivated this talk so this

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,769
talk is about my adventures with cyber

7
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,649
criminal tools and by sharing this

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:40,220
adventure with you I'm hoping that I'll

9
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:43,630
shed some light on some insights for

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:47,269
pragmatic defense so let's jump right in

11
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,489
so exploit kits are prepackaged

12
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,100
malicious tool kits that take advantage

13
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:54,559
of vulnerabilities in browsers and their

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,039
extensions and their purpose is to

15
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,260
spread malware so my adventure with this

16
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,980
cyber criminal toolkits began about six

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,050
years ago with exclusive access to about

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:10,340
40 different families of exploit kids

19
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:13,429
and with that much access to this

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,530
exploit kids of course you won't find

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,830
this exploit kids on the mainstream

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,460
market for us we were able to get access

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,470
to this exploit toolkits sources through

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,100
colleagues that work with law

25
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,408
enforcement so in the underground

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:33,048
cybercrime economy these exploit kids

27
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:36,200
are marketed with the colorful you know

28
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:38,540
branch that you see on the slide so over

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,329
the years the business model of these

30
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,960
exploit kits has evolved from the

31
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:47,360
traditional paper license model to what

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,439
we now call exploit kit as a service

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,829
model so once this tool kits are

34
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,949
deployed in the wild and they are there

35
00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:01,100
so they're here is how they are going to

36
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:04,130
infect victims so this is a typical

37
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,210
exploit kit infection chain which begins

38
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:10,340
usually with an entitlement state that

39
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,920
leverages social engineering or typical

40
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,680
drive-by download vectors and then the

41
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,170
victim is silently redirected behind the

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,250
scenes by leveraging or taking advantage

43
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,859
of traffic Direction systems so that the

44
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,660
purpose of this redirection is to kind

45
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,880
of conceal the footprint of the attack

46
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,420
and then we have fingerprinting which is

47
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,340
basically

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,859
profiling the client for what kind of

49
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,620
browser browser extensions operating

50
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,260
system it is running and then combining

51
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,870
this to compare it against the exploit

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,109
pool that the exploit kid has and then

53
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,020
pick the right exploit to to launch so

54
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,750
that the next stage is infection so once

55
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,989
the the exbrook it figures out the the

56
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,830
the system the the victim is vulnerable

57
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:59,930
it picks the right exploit and it launch

58
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,180
that exploit which which is basically

59
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,700
dropping and executing this payload on

60
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,180
on the victim machine it doesn't stop

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,268
there

62
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,920
a most exploited infections usually have

63
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:12,860
this last stage where they call back

64
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,738
home and say hey I'm on this machine

65
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,519
they got access to it what do you want

66
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:20,120
me to do next

67
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:25,330
this kind of credits are stepping stone

68
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:30,019
for doing further exploits later okay so

69
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:34,760
as a defender a more realistic question

70
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:38,049
that people should ask is okay this

71
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,450
exploit kids have a lot of information

72
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:45,320
but in this broader sense of cybercrime

73
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:49,429
analysis what is the the best strategy

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:52,130
to to follow to take advantage of this

75
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:58,329
exploit get intelligence and improve the

76
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:58,329
state of defense so the state of defense

77
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:05,420
whenever somebody advises you about the

78
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,489
state of defense they say oh you don't

79
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,890
have to be reactive all the time you you

80
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:13,730
got to be proactive so that's that's a

81
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:16,130
very common defense advice you get from

82
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:22,820
people in industry or you know in other

83
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:25,700
places okay fair enough here is a

84
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,950
different take on that advice so advice

85
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,250
one point over says you have to be

86
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,240
proactive and this talk is saying you

87
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,300
have to be pragmatic

88
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,570
so to meaningfully improve the state of

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,659
defense in the cyber crime arms race

90
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:43,009
well it's good to be proactive but I

91
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:46,909
argue that it's

92
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:50,180
great to be pragmatic so what do I

93
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:52,969
really mean by that so what I mean by

94
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,800
that is you can intelligently combine

95
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:59,990
reactive proactive and offensive

96
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,639
strategies for what I call pragmatic

97
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,569
defense so why why is this something

98
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,930
that makes sense

99
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:11,479
well this three seemingly disjoint or

100
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:15,979
different strategies can actually

101
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:18,469
coexist in practice and they are neither

102
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:23,210
mutually exclusive nor opposing forces

103
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:25,248
when you apply them in practice so the

104
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,799
next question people might ask is okay

105
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:29,740
is this really a thing if there's

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,009
something that we can do practically

107
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:37,309
well to illustrate advice point 2.0

108
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:41,360
which is don't be just productive you

109
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:44,149
can be pragmatic so to illustrate that

110
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,999
let's zoom in on my adventures with

111
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:50,599
exploit kids so the first part I'm going

112
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:52,969
to talk about is this work of probing

113
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:57,438
exploit kids kids to extract what we

114
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:58,519
call behavior fingerprints okay so how

115
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,229
do we do this

116
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:05,209
so basically we deployed this explore

117
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:07,279
kids because I told you that we have

118
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:10,249
access to about 40 different families of

119
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,080
explore kids so you can deploy them and

120
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:14,809
play with them and see what happens so

121
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,508
we did exactly that in a controlled

122
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:20,389
environment of course and the the two

123
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:21,939
goals we had for this are first we want

124
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,709
to understand the common behavior or

125
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:27,349
across there's 40 different families and

126
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:29,330
also the unique fingerprints of the

127
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:31,819
different families we have and the

128
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,948
second goal of course which is a follow

129
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,379
up of the first one is once we know

130
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:39,080
something about this exploit kids

131
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:42,080
collectively or individually we want to

132
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:47,029
actively probe probe and identify this

133
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:49,430
exploit kids in the wild okay so with

134
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:51,709
that goal in mind we did our analysis in

135
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,110
a controlled environment we deployed

136
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:56,569
honey clients that interact with this

137
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,639
exploit kids we also used here

138
00:06:56,569 --> 00:07:01,550
to interact with us explode kids we

139
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:05,119
combined the insights and we found out

140
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:08,149
interesting behaviors that exploit kids

141
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:11,389
exhibit specifically attack centric

142
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:14,059
behaviors and also self-defense

143
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:16,759
behaviors so for example almost all of

144
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:19,729
them do fingerprinting that happens to

145
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,999
be the core stage or phase of the

146
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:26,360
exploit kit infection chain there is

147
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:29,300
redirection chain there is education of

148
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,300
exploits across the board and there is

149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,270
even a case where an exploit kit allows

150
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,939
the kid administrator to bring their own

151
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,969
exploits basically extending the exploit

152
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:45,020
born custom exploits and on the other

153
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:47,569
side as much as they do attack they also

154
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,808
want to stay under the radar of you know

155
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:54,319
standard protection mechanisms like AVS

156
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:56,240
and so ideas and so on they have some

157
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,269
mechanisms for protecting themselves for

158
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,699
example they block robots like Google

159
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:05,029
BOTS and so on they look up their own

160
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:09,050
URL in black lists so that they change

161
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:11,419
it they look at signatures of Av engines

162
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,189
and you know try to create create a

163
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,159
different variant of themselves and

164
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:21,099
sometimes they also use this confusing

165
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:24,169
ways of responding to humans versus bots

166
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:26,659
so the defense capability that we were

167
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,969
able to distill from this kind of

168
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:31,369
experience is basically we were able to

169
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:34,578
build a system that can probe live

170
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:37,399
exploit get URLs and identify the family

171
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:42,468
of this exploit kids with respect to the

172
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:44,329
40 families we we have in store so some

173
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,389
of the intriguing findings that we came

174
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:50,329
across are for example within a span of

175
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:54,170
five months we were able to actively

176
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:57,380
probe and identify about 1100 exploit

177
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:01,339
kits which were live and kicking at that

178
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:05,779
point so the lesson that we learn from

179
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:08,870
this kind of analysis is basically by

180
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:10,040
combining the reactive strategy which is

181
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,530
observing

182
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,410
what these exploit kids have done after

183
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,380
we deployed them and come back using

184
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:22,160
that for actively probing them in the

185
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:25,189
wild we were able to combine proactive

186
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,370
and reactive strategies so as you can

187
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:31,220
see I'm building up to the Venn diagram

188
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:34,490
of the three circles reactive proactive

189
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,930
and offensive so I'm I'm done with the

190
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:42,020
two of them so but remember that we have

191
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,699
also access to the source code and we

192
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,340
didn't really look into the source code

193
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,560
in in the traditional white box setting

194
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:53,690
so that's another angle that we wanted

195
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:56,930
to explore so let me talk about that to

196
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,620
complete the whole circle here so here

197
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,709
what we did was was to kind of build an

198
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,740
infiltration framework that relies on

199
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:09,050
white box source code analysis to

200
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,020
identify vulnerabilities using this

201
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:16,790
vulnerabilities to build real exploits

202
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:18,650
that we can use as weapons to target and

203
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:25,939
infiltrate this exploit kits that we

204
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:28,550
find in the wild okay so the the the

205
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,770
whole motivation we have is since most

206
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:35,000
of the exploit kits that we analyzed

207
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:37,250
have none office gated source code this

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,180
is a low-hanging fruit for doing white

209
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,770
box analysis and using the results of

210
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,170
the vulnerability analysis to build

211
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,120
exploit kits in automated manner the end

212
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,979
goal here is to build a

213
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,170
counter-offensive strategy backed by

214
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,480
legal authorization because you cannot

215
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,150
arbitrarily apply this to any website

216
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,690
you should have that legal backing to

217
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:03,290
use this kind of toolkit so the

218
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,000
challenges we faced over there well if

219
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,860
you're familiar with white box

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,380
vulnerability analysis or source code

221
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,060
analysis in general they're this systems

222
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,730
tend to have you know false positives

223
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,849
therefore we have to narrow down you

224
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:20,330
know the large number of vulnerabilities

225
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:23,000
into exploitable ones and deploy this as

226
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,560
real exploits or concrete exploits and

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,990
we have

228
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,819
to do this in an automated manner so

229
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,410
this are the challenges we had to

230
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,720
navigate to get there okay so you might

231
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,939
wonder who will be using such a strategy

232
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,290
or such a toolkit and for what purpose

233
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:43,900
well there are real use cases for this

234
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,689
real motivations and real interest from

235
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,660
the law enforcement community to do

236
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,730
things like takedown of botnets or

237
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,279
gathering intelligence about this

238
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,290
criminal toolkits or simply searching

239
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,920
and fingerprinting toolkits so that we

240
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,959
reinforce defense or even sometimes if

241
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,990
you cannot do all of the three I just

242
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,360
mentioned you can simply interact with

243
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:13,060
the exploit kit and confuse it by

244
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:15,010
feeding it some garbage data so the

245
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,109
defense capability that we were able to

246
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,140
distill from this counter-offensive

247
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,480
approach is we were able to do things

248
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,750
like hijacking the backend of that the

249
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,850
exploited corrupting the infection

250
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,589
statistics so basically showing garbage

251
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,320
on the dashboard of the exploited

252
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:35,140
administrator or stealing configurations

253
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,050
and changing them or even deleting

254
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,750
critical files that are useful for the

255
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,760
proper functioning of the exploit kit so

256
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:45,520
in this process we were able to build

257
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:52,360
about 10 concrete exploits over six

258
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:55,350
different exploited families so again

259
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,990
you may wonder how complex is an exploit

260
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:02,530
so after you do what I just told you so

261
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:05,080
far the kind of exploits that we built

262
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,600
are the ones you look on the right side

263
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,730
of the screen for doing for example

264
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,520
hijacking the exploit gate database or

265
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,830
wipe out exploit gate installation and

266
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,329
I'm by no means assuming that you're

267
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,100
reading everything in here and that's

268
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,140
the not the point of bringing this up

269
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,790
but the point I'm trying to make here is

270
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,610
it's about 15 lines of code on average

271
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:33,839
for writing an exploit for a specific

272
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:33,839
exploit target or exploit a target so

273
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:43,210
the lesson we learn from this part is

274
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,430
okay where's legal authorization that's

275
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,890
a very important thing here because as I

276
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,010
said earlier you cannot really literally

277
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:54,130
launch this kind of attacks to target

278
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:57,550
you know other legitimate websites or

279
00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:01,330
you know individuals so with this legal

280
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:04,149
backing and automation what you can do

281
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,760
is defenders can deter or slow down

282
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:12,520
damage is done by exploit kids or

283
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:16,810
potentially stop exploit kits so

284
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,160
circling back to the the question I

285
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,160
asked it at the beginning this holistic

286
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,079
question of in the cybercrime Arbus

287
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,329
Reyes how do we improve the state of

288
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:30,370
defense well when when I told you about

289
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,660
the control probing of exploit kids I

290
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,279
was talking about the reactive strategy

291
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,860
because the characterization was built

292
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:42,250
after the fact when I talked about the

293
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:46,540
live live probing I was simply pointing

294
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:48,180
to the proactive component and just

295
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,719
before this slide I was talking about

296
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:55,479
the counter-offensive strategy which is

297
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,820
the offensive component so that kind of

298
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,380
completes the whole picture of what I

299
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,830
call the pragmatic defense

300
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,540
so this strategist as I told you instead

301
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,370
of competing against each other they can

302
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,310
reinforce each other they can coexist

303
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,440
they can be useful so hoping that I

304
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,140
convinced you on the synergy between

305
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,190
less reactive offensive and proactive

306
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:22,029
defense I will leave you with this two

307
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,610
takeaways the first one just like as the

308
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:27,180
defenders the cyber criminals have a lot

309
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:30,100
of blind spots when they do coding

310
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:34,209
configuration or deployment of exploit

311
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:36,430
gates so we can take advantage of as

312
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:39,189
defenders we can take advantage of this

313
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:43,150
exploit kit vulnerabilities and blind

314
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:45,750
spots and build pragmatic defense to

315
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:48,730
turn the table on the cyber criminals

316
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:51,130
with that I thank you for

317
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,220
attention and I look forward to the

318
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,220
questions

319
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,380
[Applause]
