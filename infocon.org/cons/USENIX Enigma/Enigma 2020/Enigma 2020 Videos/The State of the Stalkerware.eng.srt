1
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,860
so my name is Eva galperin I am the

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,890
director of cyber security at the

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,029
Electronic Frontier Foundation I am also

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:29,810
the head of EFS threat lab which focuses

5
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:35,219
on the protection of particularly

6
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:39,510
vulnerable populations and as part of my

7
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,950
work I spend a lot of time tracking apts

8
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,579
so like the kind of stuff that we've

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,520
been talking about earlier in in this

10
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,499
conference I did a bunch of work

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:56,399
tracking a PT's in in Syria in

12
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:57,960
Kazakhstan in Lebanon in Vietnam and

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,530
this was the kind of stuff that wasn't

14
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,989
receiving a lot of attention from you

15
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,180
know from security vendors because there

16
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,000
just wasn't a lot of money in it it's

17
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,140
not like Vietnamese activists were

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,560
purchasing a lot of a lot of enterprise

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,320
antivirus solutions so as a result it

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,520
very rarely got written about one of the

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,139
other reasons it was rarely written

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,600
about is because this malware was not

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,580
very sophisticated so the kind of people

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,119
who pride themselves on writing reports

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,070
about about malware often want to show

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,080
off how good they are at reversing it

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,580
and how good they are at at finding

28
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,820
stuff so there was just there was no

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,940
glory in this work but what there was

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,210
was protection for journalists and

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,750
activists so I went ahead and I did that

32
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:53,880
for a few years I spent a few years

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:02:00,030
doing that and then in late 2017 early

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,500
2018 I discovered that one of my

35
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,350
research partners with whom I had done a

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:11,310
whole bunch of this work was a serial

37
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:13,140
rapist and I was really really mad and

38
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:17,790
one of the reasons that I was angry was

39
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:22,708
that I read a interview with with one of

40
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:25,140
his survivors and she was asked so what

41
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,420
took you so long why did you not come

42
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,519
forward earlier and

43
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,339
she said well I'm you know I was just

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,739
this like teenage punk kid and he was a

45
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,290
hacker and I was really worried that he

46
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,670
was going to compromise my devices that

47
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,200
he would break into my phone that he

48
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,069
would break into my computer and in fact

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:48,450
he had threatened to do so and I found

50
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:52,350
this horrifying I not only felt terrible

51
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,790
for her but I didn't want anyone to ever

52
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,060
feel that way again

53
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:00,510
I didn't like the idea of my people

54
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:04,310
being the bad guys and so I did what I

55
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:09,269
usually do and I'm angry which was I

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,769
tweeted and what I tweeted was if you

57
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:12,180
are a woman who has been sexually abused

58
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:13,709
by a hacker who threatened to compromise

59
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,080
your devices contact me and I will make

60
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,950
sure they get properly examined now I

61
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,180
tweeted this like in the middle of the

62
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:26,450
afternoon and then I went off to get

63
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:32,459
lunch and I came back and it had been

64
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:34,380
retweeted 10,000 times as a result of

65
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,910
which I became sort of a one-woman

66
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:42,060
helpline for victims of this kind of

67
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,700
abuse who are concerned about the about

68
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,579
the compromise of their devices and I

69
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,578
would wake up every morning to somewhere

70
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:54,150
between zero and twelve messages in my

71
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:55,739
inbox of people telling me the stories

72
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:01,140
of the worst thing that had ever

73
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:02,609
happened to them that's a lot of mail so

74
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,608
there I was going through all of all of

75
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:09,570
these messages and I received messages

76
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:12,209
from from men who were being stalked by

77
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,630
women from men who were abused by men

78
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:20,280
from women who were abused by women

79
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:22,140
though the vast majority of of the

80
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,229
messages that I got were from women who

81
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,419
were abused by men and the fact that I

82
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,430
had targeted my tweet specifically at

83
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:35,640
women may have had something to do with

84
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:41,100
that I I saw all kinds of things I there

85
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:44,940
was a gentleman who came to me because

86
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:48,510
his partner had outed him as gay to his

87
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:52,080
extremely conservative Korean family I

88
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:56,310
had underage girls come to me and tell

89
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,169
me that they were being blackmailed they

90
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,670
were told that somebody had you know

91
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,990
naked pictures of them and would send

92
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,350
those photos to everybody in their

93
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,660
contact list unless unless of course

94
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,540
they took more naked pictures and sent

95
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,520
them to to their blackmailer to which I

96
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,660
replied you should tell your blackmailer

97
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,400
that he is now in possession of child

98
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:19,880
porn and he better run so I was seeing a

99
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,080
lot of a lot of different stuff and

100
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:27,030
mostly what I saw was a lot of confusion

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:32,580
over what people's problems were because

102
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:35,909
data is like water and water leaks so

103
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,039
there are different sources of leaks I

104
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,990
learned over the course of my of my work

105
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:46,950
the first is just humans humans being

106
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,830
humans talking it was very common to see

107
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,950
the source of leaks simply be someone's

108
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:55,229
friends it is not uncommon for an abuser

109
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,420
to simply approach all of their victims

110
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,120
friends under the guise of being

111
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,830
concerned about their well-being and get

112
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,460
all kinds of information about them that

113
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:09,979
they would not know otherwise this is

114
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:14,150
extra super common I saw it all the time

115
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:19,050
the other form of compromise that I saw

116
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:20,580
was account compromised email accounts

117
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,260
Twitter accounts

118
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:29,419
tik-tok accounts I had to learn what a

119
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:35,219
tick tock was basically the Apple ID

120
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:38,970
Spotify nest if it had a login I saw it

121
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,160
compromised and there's sort of good

122
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,140
news around that I know that that sounds

123
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,080
sort of counterintuitive but the good

124
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,120
news around a device compromise is we

125
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,550
have advice fordham preferred device cop

126
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,449
or sorry for account compromised we have

127
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:57,689
things that we can tell people to do

128
00:06:54,449 --> 00:07:00,599
many things that have logins also have a

129
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:02,460
screen that looks like this which shows

130
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:05,069
you who's been logging into your account

131
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,318
where they've been logging in from what

132
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,520
kind of device they're using and so one

133
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,180
of the things that I was able to tell

134
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,490
people who were concerned about about a

135
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,770
come-up compromise was to go look at

136
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,080
these screens for for their accounts

137
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,109
that they're concerned about and tell me

138
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,438
do you see any unfamiliar devices do you

139
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,089
see any unfamiliar locations and that

140
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,520
was a very good start

141
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,979
furthermore we have good advice for

142
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,669
telling people how to lock down their

143
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,529
accounts you can tell people just change

144
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:39,990
all of your passwords make sure that

145
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:43,050
your passwords are strong make sure that

146
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,460
they're unique use a password manager in

147
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:50,310
order to make sure that that's the case

148
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:53,489
and when it comes time to fill in your

149
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:57,240
security questions use those as more

150
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,039
passwords otherwise your account may

151
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,749
very well be compromised by somebody who

152
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,029
is close to you and therefore knows your

153
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:05,249
mother's maiden name or the name of the

154
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,979
street that you grew up on or the name

155
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:13,860
of your first dog the name of my first

156
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:15,360
dog is a forty character string and

157
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,499
finally the other thing that we advise

158
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,259
people to do when they're concerned

159
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:20,909
about account compromised is to turn on

160
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,409
the highest level of two-factor

161
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,810
authentication that they're comfortable

162
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:28,649
using there is a lot of argument over

163
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:31,379
whether or not some two-factor is better

164
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:35,099
than no two-factor and whether getting

165
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:38,010
people to use twos tokens is better than

166
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:41,880
not using tokens and whether or not they

167
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:45,029
should be using SMS at all but my

168
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:49,260
philosophy is that you have to meet

169
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:52,050
people where they are and usually I just

170
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,449
encouraged them to use as much

171
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,930
two-factor as they feel that they can

172
00:08:54,449 --> 00:09:01,589
handle because if I walk into a room and

173
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,640
I tell a victim of harassment and

174
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,100
assault

175
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,089
go buy a you Baqi and she doesn't have

176
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,059
fifty bucks for you McKee I

177
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:12,149
helped I'm basically just fell you know

178
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:15,399
kind of smug patted myself on the back

179
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:21,249
threw on my cape and then flew away so

180
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:24,189
not helping but sometimes sometimes it

181
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:26,980
really is a rat a rat is short for

182
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:31,839
remotes remote access tool also an

183
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:34,930
adorable little critter so I did start

184
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,850
seeing grass and the vast majority of

185
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,099
the cases that came to me were not rats

186
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,430
but the cases that came to me that were

187
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,410
that involved remote access tools were

188
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:50,079
the ones that were most often linked to

189
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,809
sustained harassment I and often

190
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,349
physical violence sometimes the

191
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:57,850
kidnapping of children these were by far

192
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,209
the most horrific cases these were the

193
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,670
cases that kept me up at night and we

194
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,888
don't have a lot of advice to give to

195
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,860
people who have remote access tools

196
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:12,610
covertly installed on on their devices

197
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,699
right now the stuff that they have

198
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,439
installed on their on their devices is

199
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:21,459
usually referred to as stalker wear or

200
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:26,019
spouse wear stalker where is the entire

201
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:28,628
class of software which is designed to

202
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:32,350
be covertly installed on a device on

203
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:38,100
your phone on your tablet on your laptop

204
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:41,699
and to covertly exfiltrate that data to

205
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,860
to the person who controls that software

206
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:48,819
the way that stalker wear usually works

207
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,620
is that it's extremely easy to find you

208
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,920
just go into your favorite search engine

209
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,689
I and you type in how do I spy on my

210
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,269
girlfriend how do I set up a spy on my

211
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:00,160
boyfriend catch a cheater

212
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:04,870
that's usually the framing that they

213
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:08,410
really enjoy using and you will get you

214
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:13,360
will get a page the page will offer you

215
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:15,179
a variety of products for different for

216
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,930
different devices and different os's

217
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,949
in

218
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:23,739
the Android ecosystem usually you will

219
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:26,378
either download it from the from the

220
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,619
Google Play Store or you will get a link

221
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:32,199
to a to a package that you can then go

222
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:38,050
ahead and install on on the Android

223
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:42,990
device we have seen sort of a

224
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,449
proliferation of these of these

225
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,869
applications in the Google Play Store

226
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:51,579
but we've also seen some some efforts to

227
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:57,069
combat them which I will talk about a

228
00:11:51,579 --> 00:12:01,149
little bit later then what you do is you

229
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:04,779
give the stock of our company your yo

230
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:08,559
credit card number and you pay for a

231
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:10,540
monthly subscription to a portal they

232
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,360
store all of the information from the

233
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,139
device and they grant you access to it

234
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,410
so the extent to which they they know

235
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:22,389
who is using this software who is buying

236
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,990
this software and what information your

237
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:32,949
exfiltrating from from the devices is is

238
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:35,399
really quite broad again how do you know

239
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:37,929
that it's stalker ware or spyware

240
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,670
usually they'll go ahead and tell you

241
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:42,429
the marketing is pretty straightforward

242
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,050
I say things like access to cocoa spy

243
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:46,029
gives you the lead on how to spy on your

244
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,069
wife with ease you don't have to worry

245
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,019
about where she goes who she talks to or

246
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:56,889
the websites that she visits you could

247
00:12:50,019 --> 00:13:02,649
also not worry by not spying this is my

248
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:06,429
personal favorite ad this is a this is

249
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:09,610
an ad for a spyware product which is

250
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:14,290
framed essentially as mobile spy app for

251
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:16,149
personal catch cheating spouses the text

252
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:20,349
which may be somewhat difficult to read

253
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:22,480
it talks about how often partners cheat

254
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,649
which is why it's so important to keep

255
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,079
an eye on them

256
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:29,769
you too could be that guy holding that

257
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,378
woman with the black eye make absolutely

258
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:36,339
no mistake this software is on the side

259
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:40,660
of the abuser that's their that's their

260
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:43,749
moneymaker so it turns out there's an

261
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,029
entire industry of software that's

262
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:49,119
designed to catch unwanted software on

263
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:51,279
your devices also known as antivirus

264
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:54,100
there may be some antivirus people here

265
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,839
in the audience and so the very first

266
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:00,730
thing that I did was I went to see how

267
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:04,420
well these antivirus companies did at at

268
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:08,279
detecting stalker wear on people's

269
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:12,160
devices and the answer was not so good I

270
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,300
downloaded a bunch of apks I ran them

271
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,309
through virustotal

272
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:21,309
and I got results like seven out of

273
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:24,660
sixty detect this or if I was in you

274
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:28,620
know particularly good luck 10 out of 61

275
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:32,529
these were exceptionally bad results and

276
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,059
I was a little bit shocked I mean not

277
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,850
surprised really but you know

278
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:41,469
disappointed we're going with

279
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:44,860
disappointed so I I went to the

280
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:48,279
antivirus companies I started with with

281
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:52,059
Kaspersky because they'd had a bad year

282
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:55,870
and I have no shame about preying on the

283
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:59,170
weak at least not in this particular

284
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,670
context and what Kaspersky agreed to do

285
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:04,378
it was really quite wonderful they

286
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,120
agreed to create a new privacy alert for

287
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,850
for stalker where what they found it on

288
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,889
people's on people's devices so that you

289
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,629
would know specifically this is the

290
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:19,089
stuff which is on your device and then

291
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:21,369
you have the option of removing it which

292
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,410
you may not want to do depending on how

293
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:26,230
you feel about the person who is spying

294
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,670
on you and the level of risk that you're

295
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,769
willing to take because there is always

296
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,740
the possibility that if you further

297
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:35,019
anger your abuser that they might

298
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,540
escalate to violence this is one of the

299
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:40,410
reasons why

300
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:44,189
I always want to put the decision-making

301
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:46,199
in the hands of of the person who is

302
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,780
being spied on because we can't make

303
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,010
that decision for them and if we do make

304
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,069
that decision for them it could

305
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:56,000
potentially put them in physical danger

306
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:58,920
so Kaspersky added this this awesome new

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,620
this awesome new thing and they got much

308
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,449
better at detecting stalker wear and

309
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:09,710
spyware as I learned in later research

310
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:12,000
because Persky also put out a report

311
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,320
since they started looking for a stalker

312
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,020
wear and spyware and they were able to

313
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,550
tell the world how much stock rewards by

314
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,860
where they were seeing among Kaspersky

315
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:23,520
customers and they showed that in the

316
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,470
first eight months of last year when

317
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,870
they started tracking these things that

318
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:32,730
they saw a 35% rise in the number of

319
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:35,340
stock aware samples that they were that

320
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:38,460
they were seeing they also broke it down

321
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,260
by country but proportionally it was

322
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,380
fairly consistent with the proportion of

323
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:47,040
which countries use because first Keys

324
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,930
products so it turns out that because

325
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,349
because Persky is a very popular product

326
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,239
in Russia

327
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:57,000
Russians love spying on their spouses

328
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:59,250
who knew additionally Malwarebytes put

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,530
out a report they had also spent some

330
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,650
time looking into this problem they were

331
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:07,410
very concerned about about stalker where

332
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:11,400
my former colleague David Rees wrote a a

333
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,020
blog post about what you might do if you

334
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,130
suspect that there is stalker where on

335
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:21,240
your device I and malwarebytes reported

336
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:25,010
that they saw something like I think it

337
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,540
was 2500 samples of potentially unwanted

338
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,920
stalker where on people's computers and

339
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:34,560
the time that they were that they were

340
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:37,530
searching for ID so that's a lot here we

341
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,610
have a blog post put out by look out

342
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:44,940
look out mostly does mobile antivirus so

343
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:50,000
this is particularly interesting I and

344
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:52,230
they also set up a separate alert and

345
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,540
wrote a wrote a blog post about how

346
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,910
concerned they are about this and got

347
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,510
much better at making sure that they

348
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:03,600
would find stalker where and call it out

349
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,530
when it is on somebody's device this is

350
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:12,360
the post that was put out by

351
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:13,740
malwarebytes not too long afterwards so

352
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,620
we have a lot of people who are talking

353
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,930
about stalker where as a potential

354
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,719
threat and we've got some antivirus

355
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:24,690
companies who have finally started to

356
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:28,740
take it seriously but what next

357
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:31,320
since the profit of the prospect of

358
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,460
being a one-woman helpline for all of

359
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:39,629
the women abused by hackers in the world

360
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:42,060
is a little bit exhausting it not only

361
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,310
is it exhausting but it doesn't work

362
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:47,280
very well is a good way to get burned

363
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:50,220
out this is what we refer to in activism

364
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,980
as the hero model where one person

365
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,100
heroically takes on all of the work

366
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,780
tries to fix the problems one by one

367
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,340
gets burnt out cries and then is

368
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,000
replaced by somebody else

369
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:06,000
the hero model is what I

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,490
strongly prefer is a coalition model and

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,240
so I worked with a number of other

372
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,950
organizations in in this area to help

373
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,750
create the coalition against stalker

374
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,560
where the coalition against stalker

375
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:21,780
where includes academics people who run

376
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:26,940
organizations that directly serve

377
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:32,430
victims of domestic abuse and law

378
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:35,550
enforcement and also security industry

379
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:37,550
people and AV companies so the idea is

380
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:41,159
that we will all talk to each other and

381
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,899
as a result we will get better at at

382
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,370
solving this problem and most

383
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:50,370
importantly I don't have to do it all by

384
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:51,659
myself we have an agenda so here are the

385
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,610
things that I am trying to achieve

386
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,669
through the coalition against stalker

387
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,139
where the first is to educate potential

388
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:59,429
it was about stalker where it turns out

389
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,600
that most people don't know that this is

390
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:04,379
the thing that could happen to their

391
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,330
devices and so sometimes when they start

392
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:10,080
seeing the symptoms when they're being

393
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,279
abused they feel crazy and they don't

394
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,730
know what to do they don't know where to

395
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,619
turn they don't know where to go to the

396
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,210
second is making the detection of

397
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:21,178
stalker whereby 80 products the new

398
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,549
normal I would like to see a world in

399
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,080
which I am NOT telling people that they

400
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:26,970
have to install Kaspersky or

401
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,989
malwarebytes or lookout on their device

402
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,759
I can just say hey install any AV and it

403
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:37,409
will find this stuff for you in a

404
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:39,330
consistent and a rigorous manner in

405
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:40,649
order to get to that one of the things

406
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,158
that we're working on inside of the

407
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:46,018
coalition gets stalker where is just the

408
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,879
sharing of samples so that not every

409
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,759
company has to have you know several

410
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:54,149
engineers devoted full time to to

411
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:56,460
tracking these things down the third

412
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,049
goal that we have is educating law

413
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,629
enforcement to recognize stalker wear

414
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:05,039
and take it seriously this is one of the

415
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:07,949
areas where the goals around antivirus

416
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,869
really dovetail with with the goal

417
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,279
around education of law enforcement

418
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:17,279
because once you have antivirus on your

419
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:19,289
on your device and it consistently

420
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,149
detects stalker where suddenly you can

421
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,100
take that information and you can bring

422
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:24,949
it to the police

423
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,330
you can prove that there is an unwanted

424
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:31,889
that there's unwanted software on your

425
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:35,100
device sometimes you can identify that

426
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:36,809
software I and possibly the police could

427
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,639
then go to the company that manufactures

428
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,440
the software which should have the

429
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:41,758
credit card number and a whole bunch of

430
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,570
really useful information about the

431
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,570
person who bought it

432
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:50,249
my other goal is involves encouraging

433
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,840
law enforcement and the FTC to pursue

434
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:53,629
stalker where manufacturers and the

435
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,279
distributors that are violating the law

436
00:21:53,629 --> 00:21:58,980
we have laws that are already on the

437
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:03,029
books one of the most recent cases that

438
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:06,059
we saw late last year the FTC going

439
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:08,070
after a company called Retina X Retina X

440
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,928
made a whole bunch of the sort of top

441
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:14,220
stalker where products

442
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:16,860
and interestingly enough the FTC did not

443
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,019
punish Retina X for writing stalker

444
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,080
where they punished retina X for writing

445
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:25,559
bad stalker where that did not do a good

446
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:30,299
job of protecting the data that that it

447
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:32,009
was collecting it feels a little bit

448
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:35,899
like complaining this restaurants food

449
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:37,830
is terrible and such small portions and

450
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:39,059
finally we will work with Google and

451
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,369
Apple to keep the stalker we're out of

452
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:42,840
their App Store's the harder it is to

453
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:46,709
find this stuff and the harder it is to

454
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,439
install on on devices the higher the

455
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,289
barrier to entry is and the less likely

456
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,820
I am to find a stalker we're on on

457
00:22:52,289 --> 00:23:01,289
people's devices and finally I have my

458
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:04,529
own sneaky broader agenda and that

459
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:07,799
involves reaching out to the people who

460
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:10,769
work in the security industry to the

461
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:13,379
people who work on UI to people who do

462
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:16,700
product development and getting them to

463
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:19,918
think about the domestic abuse use case

464
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:23,340
when somebody uses your product what

465
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,210
happens when they have an abuser when

466
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:30,209
they go through a messy divorce when

467
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,850
they kick a roommate out of out of their

468
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:36,179
house what happens when somebody has

469
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,719
physical access and the username and the

470
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:44,039
password - somebody's device but is not

471
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,240
the authorized user and that's something

472
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:50,190
that we really need to start thinking

473
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:52,259
about in a much broader and more serious

474
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,450
way because mostly when I talk to

475
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,570
companies about the domestic abuse use

476
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:59,879
case I get dismissed I get told well

477
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,529
that's a corner case that's an edge case

478
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:04,129
that's not important

479
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:08,970
you've got other things to worry about

480
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:11,879
but domestic abuse is empowered by

481
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:14,970
technology and it is increasingly

482
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:21,168
prevalent in our lives and simply

483
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:23,370
dismissing it as a woman's problem or a

484
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:27,809
or an edge case

485
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:30,919
is ignoring really one of the most

486
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:34,800
important problems that I see every day

487
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,270
so if you walk out of this talk and you

488
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,490
come away with the impression that you

489
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,139
need to move the people who have been on

490
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,330
the periphery of the security

491
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,550
conversation into the center of your

492
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:48,179
security design I will consider this

493
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:52,230
talk to be a success last of all I don't

494
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:55,380
do this alone because I am lazy there

495
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:57,480
are a number of journalists who have

496
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,240
done incredible work on stalker where I

497
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,030
want to give a shout out to the

498
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,510
journalists who work on the when spies

499
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:08,370
come home series vices motherboard they

500
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,840
did an incredible job that they did it

501
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:13,830
four years before I ever touched this

502
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:15,360
issue I would also like to give a shout

503
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:18,139
out to some of the other organizations

504
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:23,610
in the coalition against stalker we're

505
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:25,530
including operation safe escape which

506
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,750
works directly with people on the ground

507
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:31,050
and does a lot of the hardest and most

508
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,780
like breaking work around this and

509
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,760
individuals like Harlow Holmes who works

510
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,889
at freedom of the press who has been

511
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,280
doing the sort of you know tedious

512
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:44,250
helping one person at a time work and

513
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:47,520
largely like ignored and unheralded

514
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:50,460
and in this four years I would not be

515
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,170
here without these people and we would

516
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,480
not be getting this level of attention

517
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,490
if it were not for all of the

518
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,640
foundational work that they did thank

519
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,640
you
