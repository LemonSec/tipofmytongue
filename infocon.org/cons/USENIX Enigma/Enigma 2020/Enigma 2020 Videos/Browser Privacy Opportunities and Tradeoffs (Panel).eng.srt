1
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,010
so hi everybody we are going to talk

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,220
today about browser privacy we are gonna

3
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,680
have a lively panel and I know a bunch

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,180
of you have a bunch of questions because

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,980
several of you have come up to me and

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,430
told me so so we're looking forward to

7
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:36,620
this what we're gonna do is each of our

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,930
presenters is going to go and present

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,339
for a few minutes I'm gonna kick off the

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,970
questions and then we're gonna open it

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,129
up to yours I would ask that when you

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,680
ask your questions please state your

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,180
name and your affiliation and please

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,339
make sure that you're asking our

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,370
presenters things which are relevant to

16
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:57,199
browser privacy because it turns out

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,580
that they are incredibly smart human

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,549
beings but they don't actually do

19
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,559
everything on the face of the planet so

20
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,960
we're gonna start with Eric eric is a

21
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,908
program manager on the Microsoft edge

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,820
team working on networking and privacy

23
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:14,140
features he's been working on web both

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,740
web sites and web browsers since 1999 I

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,479
think that means we're gonna have a

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,920
party right and he has had previous

27
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:28,490
stints on the security teams for both

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:30,469
Internet Explorer and Google Chrome good

29
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,560
morning everybody I'm excited to present

30
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:35,479
first for Microsoft edge in some ways we

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,659
are the newest browser onstage in some

32
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:43,520
ways we have the longest lineage so we

33
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:46,130
effectively relaunched edge back in two

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,179
weeks ago we relaunched edge and so

35
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:49,969
we're going to talk about kind of what's

36
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,619
new and what's not new so first I want

37
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:53,570
to set a little bit of context about how

38
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:56,270
we think about privacy and investments

39
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,758
in general and so key thing I understand

40
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,259
is Microsoft loves the web and this is

41
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,789
in multiple forms we've had people who

42
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:05,119
have been working on the web for you

43
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,969
know 20 years and more and also we've

44
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,130
had people building web applications

45
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:11,720
continuously for a very long time but

46
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,220
for people who are skeptics there's also

47
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,260
sort of the other way of looking at it

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,660
which is the web is really strategic for

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,489
Microsoft and so you know we have

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,840
Windows it's an operating system that's

51
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,640
been around for a long time and it's

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,920
been sort of our primary platform for

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,690
our browser but other platforms are

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,069
really important now particularly things

55
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,620
like mobile platforms and so the

56
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:33,298
is in some ways a common framework or a

57
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,819
common platform for us to build things

58
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:37,790
to top and so a lot of our investment in

59
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,349
new products is going into web

60
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,670
applications and websites and so it's

61
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:45,119
really important for us that the web is

62
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,828
healthy and continues to grow now one of

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,810
the things I wanted to set as context as

64
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:51,150
well is sort of the fact that you know

65
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,400
privacy is not a unique concept to

66
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,739
computing people make real-world privacy

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,269
trade-offs everyday things like you know

68
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,950
am I gonna use my loyalty card at the

69
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,989
supermarket am I gonna tweet which

70
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,488
flight I'm flying out of and when I'm

71
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,530
landing the fact that I'm on vacation

72
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,720
people make these kinds of trade-offs

73
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,019
because they see value and sharing

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,400
things with other people now privacy

75
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,680
decisions are also not made in a vacuum

76
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,450
your decision about how you do privacy

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,950
make your privacy decisions kind of

78
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,899
depends on who you're talking to what

79
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,790
the context is what the sensitivity of

80
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,189
the information is and all of these

81
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,530
concerns also apply to web-based privacy

82
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,388
decisions privacy threat models very

83
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,310
different people have different needs

84
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,959
different expectations and different

85
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,209
understandings about what's going on

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,979
from a privacy point of view so for

87
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,620
building a browser for a billion or more

88
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,849
people how do you deal with that well

89
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,290
you've got to deal with the fact that

90
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,209
people are gonna make different choices

91
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,069
and so you have to give them the ability

92
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,349
to make those choices but make them in

93
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,510
an informed way so how do you do all

94
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:50,250
this well what we did is we talked to a

95
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,590
lot of people and we've been talking

96
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,680
user studies broad user studies

97
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,030
in-person user studies to understand the

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,680
scope of the kinds of things that people

99
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,199
expect when they're making privacy

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,970
decisions on the web and broadly and

101
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,739
this has been true for a long time there

102
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,590
are different threat actors of interest

103
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,329
in the privacy space local humans so

104
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,909
people that share your computer share

105
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,680
your house have access to your device

106
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:15,840
browser vendors do I trust the person

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,820
the company that made my browser to have

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,260
my information and then finally and

109
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,959
perhaps most interestingly for this

110
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,990
conversation web sites both the sites I

111
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,270
visit and the things that they embed so

112
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,740
our browser privacy promise and more

113
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,659
generally our privacy goals for

114
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,970
Microsoft are around sort of four major

115
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:34,710
things protection so we're gonna protect

116
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,630
your data so people can't get access to

117
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,330
your data if you're not consenting to

118
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,680
give it transparency to allow people to

119
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,500
understand what's happening with their

120
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,390
information

121
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,310
has access to it in order to make an

122
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,400
informed decision about how to protect

123
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,990
that data control so just telling people

124
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,669
hey these people have your data is not

125
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,350
necessarily useful you have to give

126
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,540
people controls that allow them to

127
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,030
control who gets that data and then

128
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,620
finally respect so respect for the fact

129
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,900
that your data is valuable and giving

130
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,610
you options to remove data or send less

131
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,469
data if that's appropriate to you and

132
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,000
generally to try and avoid collecting

133
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,580
any data that we don't need for the

134
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,920
operation of the browser itself now

135
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,810
within all of this there are principles

136
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,490
that we have to live with one of them is

137
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,080
that simplicity matters giving people a

138
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,540
complicated set of controls like this

139
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,190
locks here you know some people will see

140
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,630
this and be excited but most people

141
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,130
would be scared and the wrong things

142
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,510
would happen

143
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,159
compatibility matters if we provide

144
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,990
great privacy but we're not compatible

145
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,490
with the web people will either choose

146
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,350
different browser or turn off the

147
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,300
privacy features and then finally

148
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,820
defaults matter the reality is most

149
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,530
people do not want to go in-depth on

150
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,000
their privacy settings they just want

151
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,760
the right things to happen they want a

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,200
reasonable expectation of privacy and so

153
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,150
by setting defaults that are in line

154
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,159
with that reasonable expectation we're

155
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,840
going to do better I mean the final

156
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,150
thing I want to say about that is the

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,890
ecosystems and unintended consequences

158
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,659
the web doesn't exist in a vacuum

159
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,190
people are building sites and services

160
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,870
have choices for what platforms they

161
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,910
target they can build a mobile

162
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,440
application they can take their content

163
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,930
off the open web and put it into a

164
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,210
walled garden and so if we do things in

165
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,550
privacy that hurt the open web we could

166
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,770
end up pushing people to less privacy

167
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,710
preserving ecosystems and so for

168
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,240
instance the FF had a piece today about

169
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,299
how there's a popular Android app that

170
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,800
is leaking data out and it took a long

171
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,600
time to figure out where that data was

172
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,640
being leaked because the mobile

173
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,680
platforms are less transparent than the

174
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,909
web platforms there's no view source and

175
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,460
you can do things like certificate

176
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,870
inning and so forth to prevent analysis

177
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,489
or complicate analysis of those

178
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,100
applications and so the web's

179
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,780
transparency is one of the key values it

180
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,930
provides and if we drive people in the

181
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,789
wrong way bad things will happen so one

182
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,860
of our big promises with a new edge is

183
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,229
to help users control how they're

184
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,640
tracked on the web but before I get

185
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:50,800
there one of the things that I wanted to

186
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,090
mention is there's recently been a bit

187
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,410
of discussion about how there are

188
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,770
certain browser vendors that are new to

189
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,509
privacy

190
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,190
I think that's only true if you ignore

191
00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:00,860
the history of what's happened in

192
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,750
privacy and browsers so this was the

193
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,680
first article I found about private

194
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,009
browser privacy

195
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,990
July 20th 2003 introduced new feature in

196
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,090
cookie controls an internet explorer and

197
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,830
there's been a 20-year history of

198
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,479
continued investment in things around

199
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,349
privacy whether it's controlling third

200
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,449
party cookies

201
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,940
whether it's offering local privacy with

202
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,349
features like our in private browsing

203
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,629
whether it's features that protect the

204
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:26,419
user's privacy more generally security

205
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:28,370
is you know inextricable from privacy if

206
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:30,109
you don't have a secure platform you

207
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,610
can't offer privacy if the user

208
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,500
downloads malware that leaks all their

209
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,780
data out you haven't done anything for

210
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,430
their privacy and so we've had a

211
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,940
continual investment in these solutions

212
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,039
over time but edge 79 or newest browser

213
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,300
went stable two weeks ago and so I want

214
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,009
to talk briefly about what's new there

215
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,780
the first thing is there's new

216
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,759
foundation for edge we've Reap lat

217
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,409
formed to talk chromium an open source

218
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,440
platform used by popular browsers

219
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:56,389
including two of them on stage today and

220
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,340
so this is a great thing for us in a

221
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,349
number of ways there's a lot of security

222
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,989
benefit to doing this and that helps

223
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,460
with privacy but also a more modern code

224
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,080
base gives us the ability to innovate

225
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,719
faster and build privacy-preserving

226
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,370
features now one of the concerns when

227
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:12,889
weary platformed across chromium is

228
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,539
people said hey are you gonna then be

229
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:16,759
trusting two organizations with your

230
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:19,340
data Microsoft and Google and I'm not

231
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,810
happy with that and so you know if you

232
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,779
haven't been paying attention we've

233
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,819
replaced or removed effectively all of

234
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:27,860
the communication out to the existing

235
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,419
endpoints and so for instance Safe

236
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,029
Browsing in Chrome we've replaced with

237
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:35,419
smart screen so we understand where data

238
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:37,010
is going what it's being used for we

239
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,750
have a privacy dashboard so if you go

240
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,909
edge settings privacy you can see the

241
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,490
privacy features of the browser and set

242
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,870
your controls as you like we have a

243
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,450
white paper that goes through

244
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,430
effectively every use of client-server

245
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,190
communication in the browser to explain

246
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,199
how the data what data is how it's used

247
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,089
what controls are available to the user

248
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,320
and so if you have a question of well

249
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,790
how does that work what are the privacy

250
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,470
implications about we have a white paper

251
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,890
that is very lengthy and goes in great

252
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,199
detail we have a new feature that we

253
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,689
brought over from our legacy browsers or

254
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,400
on clearing grouser data on closed

255
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,750
so you can basically configure certain

256
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,939
types of data every time you close your

257
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,230
browser just wipe it away and so this is

258
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,500
a feature that we brought back from our

259
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,450
old version but the big the big new

260
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,090
feature in edge 79 is tracking

261
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,940
prevention so tracking prevention is a

262
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,950
list based approach for restricting

263
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,800
access to storage and blocking network

264
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,020
requests based on classes of known

265
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,120
trackers or things that have the ability

266
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,010
to track you in a cross-site context and

267
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,870
so this is a bit of an eye chart but the

268
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,939
general idea is that our tracking

269
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,560
protection tracking prevention list is

270
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,630
split into different categories like

271
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,550
advertising analytics crypto mining

272
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,620
fingerprinting and so forth and then

273
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,770
depending on the category we will block

274
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,720
different things now going back the the

275
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,699
modes that we have available are basic

276
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,860
balanced and strict balanced is the

277
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,720
default where the goal is to be as

278
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,450
private as possible without impacting

279
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,460
site compatibility but if users don't

280
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,840
want any kind of real blocking that can

281
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:07,270
turn on basic which will only block

282
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,070
crypto miners and finger printers or if

283
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,960
they want effectively block everything

284
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,750
they can turn on strict mode in which

285
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,680
case everything will get blocked

286
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,690
furthermore being built on a chromium

287
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,339
base gives us the ability to run browser

288
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,190
extensions that were written for Chrome

289
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,170
or other browsers that support that

290
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,700
platform and so if you feel that your

291
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,040
privacy needs are different than those

292
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,470
that are offered to you there are other

293
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,839
extensions whether it's a VPN or

294
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,330
something like ghostery that will show

295
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,920
you what you have available to you

296
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,870
what's coming next

297
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,430
so we're gonna have a feature that's

298
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,860
coming to chromium we're gonna bring it

299
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,900
to edge 81 around stripping refers so

300
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,530
that cross-site data is is leaked less

301
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,689
often this is our it's about time

302
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,800
1992 someone said someone should think

303
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,140
about stripping her first

304
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,000
and so we're catching up and then we're

305
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,890
also inheriting from upstream having

306
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,360
cookies default to same site lacks and

307
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,730
that's going to be a big lift and that's

308
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,730
coming very soon so

309
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:11,160
[Laughter]

310
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,590
so next up we have thon VVS and she's

311
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,000
speaking for Mozilla so she's a

312
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,650
principal engineer and the Firefox

313
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,420
privacy lead at Mozilla where she's

314
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,640
advocating for a more private web for

315
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,930
all users and in this role she leads

316
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,160
vision and development of privacy

317
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,229
features in Firefox to provide

318
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,410
protections against online tracking

319
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,340
coupled with good user experience

320
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,199
she's known in particular for leading

321
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,990
Firefox enhanced tracking protection and

322
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,360
Firefox containers and most recently she

323
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,950
took a co-chair position in the new w3c

324
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,930
privacy community group where she'll

325
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:49,620
help develop privacy focused web

326
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:51,689
standards and api's hi I'm here to talk

327
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,980
about the state of web privacy today and

328
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,510
what Firefox is doing to improve that as

329
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,880
you browse the web you're constantly

330
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,890
being tracked your interests the site

331
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,710
you visit the sites you visit the

332
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:08,189
articles you read what you buy profiles

333
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:12,030
are created about you and then share it

334
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:15,150
on the backend by companies governments

335
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,939
attackers to target and manipulate users

336
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:20,069
the use of this data has gone too far

337
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,450
today and we can't even imagine what

338
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,070
this data might be used for in the

339
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,930
future

340
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,940
here are just a few examples of how our

341
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:31,439
user data is being used in nefarious

342
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,390
ways to harm society democracies are

343
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,410
compromised and elections around the

344
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,410
world are being tampered with

345
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:42,810
populations are manipulated and

346
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,850
micro-targeted fake news is delivered to

347
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,829
just the right audience at just the

348
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:51,600
right time discrimination flourishes and

349
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,850
emotional harm is inflicted on specific

350
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,210
individuals when our algorithms go wrong

351
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,210
and perhaps worst of all sophisticated

352
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,130
users who understand that effect of

353
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,350
tracking online have a chilling effect

354
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,900
on their behaviors and stop from taking

355
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,610
action let me ask all of you how many

356
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,199
people in this room have stopped

357
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,850
themselves from a behavior online

358
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,210
because they were afraid they were going

359
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:17,510
to be profiled watched or tracked I

360
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,510
certainly have

361
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,930
this is the reality of the situation

362
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:25,270
today and at Mozilla we think this is an

363
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:28,689
unacceptable cost for society to pay as

364
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,490
backed by our Mozilla manifesto people

365
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,740
are choosing between technology and

366
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,170
privacy they can't have both at the same

367
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,150
time and we envision a web where this

368
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,969
isn't the case where people are put

369
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,829
first where users don't have to look

370
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,910
over the shoulder and ubiquitous

371
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:48,430
tracking does not exist so we've

372
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:51,640
deployed a suite of privacy protections

373
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,260
in Firefox to help get us there and I'd

374
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,550
like to tell you a little bit about our

375
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:59,470
journey to get there a few years back we

376
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,420
started with tracker blocking we would

377
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,180
block trackers from loading and private

378
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,209
mode based off a list a static list from

379
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,640
disconnect we would let users who were

380
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:12,430
so inclined to opt in to block trackers

381
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,260
and regular mode as well but as time

382
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,719
passed we realized that this wasn't good

383
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,060
enough most users never changed their

384
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,430
default settings and most users don't

385
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,650
understand the extent of tracking online

386
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,469
we realized we needed to provide a

387
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,000
solution that was private by default so

388
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,370
at that point it would have been easy to

389
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,740
just block trackers in regular mode as

390
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,810
well we already had the technology we

391
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,090
just needed to flip a press but we

392
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,959
didn't want to do that because we didn't

393
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:41,940
want to break the ecosystem of the web

394
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,620
specifically we didn't want to block

395
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,410
advertisements because advertisements in

396
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,710
it's in themselves are not bad it is the

397
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:53,079
tracking and targeting technologies that

398
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:56,980
are used to target Agra advertisements

399
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:59,400
that are the problem so we decided to

400
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,780
attack the tracking problem directly and

401
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,040
instead of blocking the advertisements

402
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,170
from loading instead of blocking the

403
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,510
trackers we blocked cookie and storage

404
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,449
access for them so the ad would continue

405
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:12,280
to load we also blocked fingerprinting

406
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,710
scripts and in this case we were

407
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,400
blocking the load entirely because the

408
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:20,140
scripts were going too far and trying to

409
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,720
learn characteristics about your device

410
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,430
to track you across the web and we

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,230
continue to block trackers in private

412
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,689
browsing mode with the option to turn

413
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,270
them on in regular mode

414
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:33,520
we also wrote an extension called face

415
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,380
book container that users can install to

416
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,290
put face book in a walled garden of its

417
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,420
own because face book continues to track

418
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,790
you when you leave Facebook every like

419
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,189
share and login button you see whether

420
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,380
you click on it or not is used to

421
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,270
identify you and see what you're doing

422
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,720
and then go back and tell Facebook about

423
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,329
it

424
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,060
so in Firefox we put a wall around

425
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,250
Facebook so that what you do outside of

426
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,890
Facebook stays outside of Facebook we

427
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:03,460
also have a Firefox Private Network

428
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:05,439
feature that allows you to proxy or VPN

429
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,320
your track traffic to hide your IP

430
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,050
address and finally we have a feature

431
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,110
called Firefox monitor that'll alerts

432
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:18,329
you when a breach has occurred and your

433
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:20,950
credentials might be compromised and

434
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,710
everything that we do is underpinned by

435
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,180
our anti tracking policy which is an

436
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,110
accountable and transparent approach

437
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:32,489
that tells us that tells the world which

438
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:37,060
type of tracking mechanisms that Firefox

439
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:39,550
does not allow and if we find that a

440
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,380
party attempts to circumvent this policy

441
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,479
by getting around our tracking

442
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,560
protections then the policy gives us a

443
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:51,070
right to apply more restrictive more

444
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,260
restrictions on that party and this

445
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,880
actually came up we discovered that

446
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,330
Facebook was trying to circumvent our

447
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,480
enhanced tracking protections by using a

448
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,830
link parameter and using it across the

449
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,780
first site visit so that they were

450
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,600
following you using cookies and links

451
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,720
from site to site long after you had

452
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,139
left Facebook so we stripped the FB CL

453
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,880
ID parameter from all refers in Firefox

454
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:20,470
so that this so that Facebook couldn't

455
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,780
track you beyond the first visit one

456
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,209
thing that makes Firefox unique is that

457
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,149
we try to maximize both usability and

458
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,790
privacy at the same time so when we

459
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:32,770
deployed our tracker blocking there

460
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,810
sorry cookie blocking we had to be very

461
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,210
careful not to break legitimate use

462
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:39,100
cases such as logging but at the same

463
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,990
time we didn't want to give blanket

464
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,040
cookie access to any site you might want

465
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,710
to log in with

466
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,540
so we deployed careful heuristics to see

467
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,700
when the user might be trying to login

468
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,790
when the user showed intent we allowed

469
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,560
cookie access otherwise we did not we

470
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:56,139
also developed the storage access API

471
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,940
where developers can request storage

472
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,740
access for cases where they really need

473
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,660
it we're quite asking the user in the

474
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:05,020
browser themselves if it's ok with them

475
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,330
and finally when we don't get things

476
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,490
100% right and the user does encounter

477
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,100
breakage we allow users a per site

478
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,370
override that allows them to be

479
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,959
protected 99% of the time and choose to

480
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:22,750
disable protection when the trade-off is

481
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:25,570
worth it to them we also added a suite

482
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,430
of user privacy tools that let users

483
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,320
know how many trackers are out there

484
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,260
who's tracking them what sites have

485
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,379
trackers on them this lets users feel

486
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,300
more in control and haven't have a

487
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,660
better idea about what's going on on the

488
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,180
web

489
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,860
in fact we've blocked one point six

490
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,510
trillion trackers since we launched

491
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,949
enhanced tracking protection which

492
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,950
speaks to the magnitude of the problem

493
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,720
so what's next for Firefox we've just

494
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,990
started arguably we've only scratched

495
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,020
the surface here we're continuing to

496
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:02,320
evolve and enhance our protections we've

497
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,270
dug a pretty deep privacy hole on the

498
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,720
Internet and we're slowly trying to get

499
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:10,180
out of it we prioritize solutions that

500
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,890
have the highest user impact first and

501
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,840
we're working with industry and

502
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:17,560
standards bodies to change the landscape

503
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,959
of the ecosystem but we can't do it

504
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:23,220
alone browser vendors need to work

505
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,960
together to push the web forward

506
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,240
legislation and regulation needs to step

507
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,890
up here and keep these companies

508
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,870
accountable for the invasive and

509
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:35,170
compromising mechanisms that they're

510
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,939
using and finally you can help too by

511
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:39,220
deploying a culture of privacy within

512
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,710
your own organization by Guinea pigging

513
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:43,420
new privacy preserving technologies to

514
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,190
show that you can accomplish your tasks

515
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,250
and keep user data private at the same

516
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:54,210
time thank you

517
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:57,460
[Applause]

518
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:00,400
so next up we have Justin's shoe from

519
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:02,890
chrome he's an inch director on Google

520
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,300
Chrome's trust in safety and has been a

521
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,340
member of the chrome team for more than

522
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,649
a decade he's been working on security

523
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,000
privacy and anti abuse for 25 years

524
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,340
across the public and private sectors

525
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:26,620
and co-authored the art of software

526
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:37,810
security assessment make myself a little

527
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:39,250
bit of space here okay so I'm Justin one

528
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,020
of the teams that I'm responsible for in

529
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,130
chrome and certainly one of the things

530
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,260
that takes the most of my attention

531
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,410
right now is a the team working on

532
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,360
Chrome's privacy sandbox effort so my

533
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,060
focus is going to be really on that

534
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,219
which is about improving web standards

535
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,050
improving the baseline it's really not

536
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,790
going to be about sort of like the more

537
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,159
browser specific features approach

538
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,830
because our idea is that we really want

539
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,140
to essentially make the whole web better

540
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:10,419
and not have browsers going off in

541
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:11,680
different directions so there we go

542
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,520
so first I want to actually talk about

543
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,860
what makes the web server eight because

544
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,900
you know on the open web we do have a

545
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,639
lot of room for improvement but the

546
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,840
truth is that you know as a platform

547
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,040
it's been great and we don't want to

548
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,000
throw out all those great parts in the

549
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,460
process so right off the bat the web is

550
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,830
built on top of open standards and this

551
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,780
really has been a huge boon to the web

552
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,750
because you have amazing reach because

553
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,680
the web is a platform that can actually

554
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,650
they can actually be supported

555
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,160
everywhere and largely it you're right

556
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:47,680
and I had to raise the mic all right

557
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,080
second there's no single entity that

558
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,490
controls the web the web doesn't have

559
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,409
gatekeepers and that absence of

560
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,810
gatekeepers means that you really do

561
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:57,580
have like a low barrier to entry it's

562
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,139
easy for someone to take product

563
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,810
services whatever they want to do on the

564
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,840
web it's it's the freest space to do

565
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,840
that

566
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,460
finally ephemerality now this is sort of

567
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,379
the killer feature of the web where you

568
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,350
know sites have the ability to compose

569
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,000
content from multiple different sources

570
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:19,840
users can seamlessly migrate between

571
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,610
like move between sites etc it's it's

572
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,230
one of those things that is so great

573
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,540
about the web as a platform and that's

574
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,179
only possible because the web really

575
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,399
does have the most robust privacy and

576
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:33,130
security architecture of any platform

577
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,280
like when you view it in the abstract so

578
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:39,100
all of this makes the web unique and

579
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,510
have made the web insanely popular but

580
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,370
it's important to also understand the

581
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:46,150
reason why content producers flocked to

582
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:48,219
the web so you first need to appreciate

583
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:51,150
that most of the media that we consume

584
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,160
is actually funded by advertising today

585
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:56,050
and it has been for a very long time now

586
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,390
I'm not here to make the argument that

587
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,490
advertising is the best or only way to

588
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:05,679
fund these things but the truth is that

589
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:08,620
print radio and TV all these funded

590
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,300
primarily through advertising and the

591
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,280
whole rise of digital media has only

592
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,480
been you know has only followed on to

593
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:19,030
that effort and the fact is that having

594
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,520
this specific model is what has made a

595
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,530
wealth and variety of content broadly

596
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,490
available to people that otherwise

597
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,780
couldn't get it across the world so now

598
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,220
I don't want to talk about what people

599
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,550
are doing with advertising specifically

600
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,710
what sellers want from advertising the

601
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,970
thing is you first need to appreciate

602
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,670
that sellers want to be able to measure

603
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,070
the effectiveness of their advertising

604
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:44,020
because that's what's really useful they

605
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,399
want to know that their that advertiser

606
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,559
is actually working for them and the web

607
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,360
made that dramatically easier Digital in

608
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,428
general not just the web made that far

609
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,990
easier the other thing that sellers want

610
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,490
is they want to be able to get the

611
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:57,790
advertisement in front of their likely

612
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,800
customers once again digital made that a

613
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:02,350
whole lot easier and this was a

614
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,809
fundamental change now the outcome of

615
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,550
that fundamental change has been that

616
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:08,950
digital advertising basically took over

617
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,540
everything like absent any other factors

618
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,410
if you can do those two things really

619
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,290
really well

620
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,260
then you get to a place where you you

621
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,870
know

622
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:21,019
traditional media gets consumed just

623
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:23,719
like it has by digital advertising this

624
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:27,950
is also why when you see studies that

625
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:31,600
call out that you would lose like half

626
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,649
or more of web revenue by taking away

627
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,299
essentially the tools that are used by

628
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:36,860
digital advertising that's basically

629
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:38,899
what they mean what they mean is that

630
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,399
the money that flocked to the web

631
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:43,279
because of the tools that it provided

632
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:45,559
will now move elsewhere to places that

633
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,490
are providing those tools so that's how

634
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:51,649
to understand that in context so with

635
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,210
that background it's time to move on to

636
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:55,939
the core points of why we're all here

637
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:59,389
which is that for all of the good that

638
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,159
the web has brought it's also come at a

639
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:04,039
significant cost like right now there is

640
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:08,360
just too much data being exchanged it's

641
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:11,139
too it's too opaque it's confusing it's

642
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,209
just not what users expect or want and

643
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:16,399
to be clear this isn't a new thing this

644
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,019
sort of data interchange happened before

645
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:21,289
you just used to do it through things

646
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:24,169
like subscriber lists or through you

647
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:25,460
know the phone book there are various

648
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,049
ways that it was done before but today

649
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,419
it's just happening at a scope and scale

650
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:31,908
because of all this connectivity that no

651
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,440
one could really predict so that's why

652
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:36,409
we need to have new solutions for this

653
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,360
but the solutions have to be robust

654
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,559
solutions that really do work they have

655
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,418
to be standard solutions that we can

656
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:45,350
support everywhere in keeping with how

657
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:47,240
the web works now there are two major

658
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,459
trends that are concerning the first is

659
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,010
that content is currently leaving the

660
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,340
web and it's this happening because it's

661
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:58,580
just easier to monetize in apps today

662
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:00,019
now I do not fault the oh sorry I should

663
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,760
say walled gardens because it's not just

664
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:03,019
limited to apps so I don't fault these

665
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,908
other platforms they have very different

666
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,679
threat models they're taking a very

667
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:07,970
different approach and it's

668
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,580
understandable they just work

669
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,529
differently the web is unique in that we

670
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,750
have you know hardened the web by fire

671
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:17,600
over the last 30 years of running

672
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:20,029
potentially untrusted content from any

673
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,590
arbitrary source no other platform has

674
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:23,090
been through that and that's why no

675
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,668
other platform can make the same kind of

676
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:29,449
guarantees as the web

677
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:31,969
the other big thing is the rise of

678
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,519
covert tracking now it's important to

679
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:36,289
understand that there are two reason two

680
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:40,249
major drivers for this one of the big

681
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:41,809
drivers is that as we had the rise of

682
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:44,779
mobile and people increasingly became

683
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:47,119
multi device users they you had the

684
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:48,559
situation where advertisers wanted to be

685
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,809
able to measure things across different

686
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,178
devices because the user might start a

687
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:55,759
conversion on one side conversion being

688
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:57,109
sort of how they determine that an ad

689
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,059
worked it started conversion on one

690
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:01,158
device and the conversion might just

691
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:04,849
happen or end up completing on another

692
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:07,190
device so advertisers came up with ways

693
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:09,829
to track identity across multiple

694
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:11,929
devices and this kind of tracking

695
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:13,759
focuses on things like IP address

696
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:15,919
fingerprinting and carrier metadata

697
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,959
tracking and the other big one is

698
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,909
joining identifiable information or

699
00:27:17,959 --> 00:27:21,469
personally identifiable information so

700
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:23,570
this is a thing like if you've ever been

701
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:24,859
to a site where they say hey if you want

702
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:28,249
to review this content please subscribe

703
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:29,599
for our newsletter odds are they it's

704
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:31,159
not so much about emailing you that

705
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,899
newsletter it's about getting your email

706
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:35,229
address so that they can connect your

707
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:38,899
data across multiple devices and sites

708
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:41,629
now the other big driver for covert

709
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:43,039
tracking was to bypass the anti tracking

710
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:47,599
mechanisms that are starting to appear

711
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:50,749
so this is a different situation where

712
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:53,299
browsers as discussing today have been

713
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:57,169
adding new mechanisms either list based

714
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:59,059
or heuristic based that are designed to

715
00:27:57,169 --> 00:28:00,979
mitigate the kind of tracking that they

716
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:03,950
we see occurring they block resource

717
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:07,219
loads or they block cookies etc the

718
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:09,950
thing is that those for the most part i

719
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:11,839
by our bye possible by the mechanisms

720
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,070
that i already mentioned but in addition

721
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,829
to the mechanisms that i just mentioned

722
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,468
you also have a whole bunch of other

723
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:19,879
tricks that can that can be used to

724
00:28:18,469 --> 00:28:21,679
track and bypass these mechanisms things

725
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:25,158
like cname redirection client-side

726
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,019
fingerprinting hostname rotation and the

727
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,479
heuristic based mechanisms can impose

728
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:32,359
other kinds of issues if you're his hero

729
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:34,279
stick is state based and it can be used

730
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:35,779
as a state channel across different

731
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,669
sites it can actually leak information

732
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:38,460
and end up introducing worse problems

733
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:43,860
than what you were trying

734
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:46,470
to prevent now actually I should go back

735
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:49,290
one because I want to be clear we

736
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,090
actually do use a lot of state-based

737
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,590
Mecca or sorry we do use a lot of lists

738
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,980
and heuristics in chrome they're not a

739
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:57,149
bad thing but you do have to be really

740
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,650
careful and you do have to think about

741
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:02,160
the ecosystem impacts of using these

742
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:04,050
things now now I'm actually going to get

743
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,640
to solutions so I wanna start by saying

744
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,240
something shocking and I'm gonna try to

745
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,910
say it fast

746
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,070
broadly speaking advertisers don't

747
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:15,300
actually need your data all that they

748
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:17,220
really want is to monetize efficiently

749
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,960
the publishers that rely on them the

750
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,750
content producers that are on them they

751
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,630
just want to be able to measure track

752
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:27,480
conversions etc so what we're proposing

753
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,700
here is that we can just give them the

754
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,020
tools to do that without actually

755
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:35,060
building profiles on you or tracking you

756
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,250
the approach that we're proposing is

757
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:42,240
called the chrome privacy sandbox and it

758
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:44,160
has four prong main prongs to it the

759
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,470
first is to remove the tracking surface

760
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,720
this is just basically take away the

761
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,800
easy tools the trackers are using you

762
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,080
may have heard that we're already

763
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,280
phasing out third-party cookies we've

764
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,620
started that with the same site by

765
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,330
default rollout that's happening now our

766
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,889
goal is to remove them entirely over the

767
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,210
next three years and the other state

768
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,130
mechanisms that are attached to them

769
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:05,010
there's also other things like user

770
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,180
agent simplification and various and

771
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,280
various other things like our privacy

772
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,410
budget so we can still allow site

773
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,300
developers to do interesting things but

774
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:15,590
not be stuck within a draconian privacy

775
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:18,300
or with integer Konan API restrictions

776
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:21,240
the next thing is audit and attestation

777
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:23,100
now this is for cases where we simply

778
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,560
cannot rely on technical measures to

779
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,240
provide any reasonable guarantee so we

780
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,370
propose something we propose willful IP

781
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,410
blindness which is a way that we can

782
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:35,610
rely on out it an attestation to protect

783
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:38,780
against Network tracking I'm gonna fast

784
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:42,570
forward really quickly now next one is

785
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,580
privacy preserving api's this is meet

786
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,520
the use cases that the developers need

787
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,939
we're talking about advertising

788
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,030
addressing that through things like

789
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,230
federated learning and other privacy

790
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,610
preserving techniques but

791
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:57,809
also talking about things like login and

792
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:03,840
various other needs the web has say like

793
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:05,580
anti abuse oh and anti abuse is the last

794
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,860
one this is more the broader case of

795
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,320
anti abuse this is the case of even with

796
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,530
all of the new api's we do need to have

797
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,260
a way to catch the things that fall

798
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,668
through the cracks and prevent prevent

799
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:29,370
sort of the kinds of workarounds and all

800
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:31,440
that that we see today thanks Justin

801
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:35,189
okay and our last presentation is gonna

802
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,750
be from yawns ooh yawn is brave see so

803
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,669
and has been doing security engineering

804
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,049
there for the last four years and in the

805
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:41,760
past she's worked on privacy enhancing

806
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:43,100
browser extensions at the at the

807
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,570
Electronic Frontier Foundation

808
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:50,879
Foundation and served on the w3c

809
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:52,559
technical architecture group hello thank

810
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,419
you I'm gonna try to go fast cuz I know

811
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,610
you guys have a lot of questions and we

812
00:31:54,419 --> 00:32:00,090
want to have time to address them so

813
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,830
brave is the new kid on the block if we

814
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,928
don't count just a completely new

815
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,540
processor I suppose we started about

816
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:08,820
four years ago and something that people

817
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,960
ask is given that we have all these

818
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,820
other great browsers why yet another one

819
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,919
so the main goal of brave is we want to

820
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:19,350
prepare the privacy problems in the

821
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,540
existing ad ecosystem in a way that no

822
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:24,809
other browser has really tried well

823
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:27,690
giving publishers a revenue stream so

824
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:30,240
the default and brave is and has has

825
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,780
always been to block the privacy evasive

826
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,669
ads and trackers I won't get too much

827
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,168
into the payment side of things because

828
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:40,110
that's kind of beyond the scope of this

829
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:42,210
talk but basically we have options to

830
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,100
send micro payments to publishers and

831
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:47,669
also an option to see privacy-preserving

832
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:50,370
ads so technically we are a chromium

833
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:53,520
fork on desktop in Android and a Firefox

834
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:57,209
fork on iOS so building upon these

835
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:00,000
people's work as you know websites are

836
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,799
mostly funded by ads a thing that some

837
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,900
people don't realize is when you make a

838
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:05,820
request to a web site

839
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,160
for Anna and the website is showing you

840
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,770
advertisements there are actually many

841
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,830
other parties behind the scenes such as

842
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:16,410
supply-side platforms ad exchange just

843
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,960
demand-side platforms so you're not just

844
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,490
making one request to get an ad behind

845
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,800
the scenes there can be hundreds or

846
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:27,450
sometimes even thousands of bid requests

847
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,730
and these requests can leak data that

848
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,990
people find concerning for instance

849
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:38,700
gender year of birth IP address and

850
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:41,910
sometimes even geolocation and as a

851
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,170
result of this and also because users

852
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:47,280
see negative performance impacts and

853
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,270
sometimes sometimes they think ads are

854
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,610
ugly

855
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,800
it's no surprise that advert ad blocking

856
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:55,709
has been going up pretty steadily in the

857
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:00,570
last decade or so especially on mobile

858
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:03,210
which is the orange line so I'm brave I

859
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:05,340
want to highlight are one of our primary

860
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,370
interfaces for privacy protection which

861
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,860
is called shields so there are these

862
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:13,560
global settings for shields these apply

863
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,050
to all sites by default the default is

864
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,149
blocking ads and trackers blocking all

865
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:20,250
third-party cookies with a few

866
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:22,799
exceptions that we had to make for web

867
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,469
compatibility and blocking third-party

868
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,929
fingerprinting and HTTPS Everywhere and

869
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:30,989
these are all over writable on

870
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:33,540
individual sites as a interface called

871
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:37,560
shields and keep in mind these are per

872
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:39,719
site settings so ads and tracker

873
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,340
blocking are based on the lists from

874
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,899
disconnect and adblock plus easy lists

875
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,179
you might ask so how is this better than

876
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:51,210
if I just download Chrome and install

877
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,760
extensions one of the benefits is that

878
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,250
were able to do this kind of blocking

879
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,230
and filtering in languages like rusts

880
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,930
which are better for performance than

881
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:05,370
doing it in JavaScript and web

882
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:07,770
extensions another thing that we have

883
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,880
tried is device recognition blocking

884
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,670
some people also call this

885
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,130
fingerprinting blocking these are type

886
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,220
stat sites made to bypass third-party

887
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:20,690
cookie blocking by recognizing

888
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:22,459
users based on their browser traits this

889
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:24,829
is a best-effort defense because when

890
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,380
you start to block web api's you run

891
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:31,190
into a high risk of breaking legitimate

892
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:33,230
website functionality so currently we do

893
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:37,910
the best we can and we only enable this

894
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:39,560
by default and third-party frames and

895
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,819
these are some of the methods that we

896
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:46,670
block another cool thing we do is embed

897
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:50,300
HTTPS Everywhere by default so that was

898
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:52,490
a project by the e FF that it's

899
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,190
basically a very long list of sites that

900
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:57,950
are known to support HTTPS but don't

901
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,680
default to them so if a site like New

902
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:03,169
York Times defaults to http and we know

903
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:09,348
has a valid TLS certificate we will

904
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:11,359
automatically upgrade it to HTTPS so

905
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,460
script locking is disabled by default

906
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,730
because websites really like to use

907
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:20,089
javascript but javascript obviously can

908
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:22,069
also be used for tracking so off by

909
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:24,890
default but this is an advanced setting

910
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:27,109
that some people can turn on so I

911
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:29,839
mentioned earlier that we are mostly

912
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:32,690
based on chromium we disable a lot of

913
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,940
features similar to edge such as Google

914
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:38,420
accounts integration chrome sync

915
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:41,329
obviously chrome telemetry your all

916
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,220
navigation suggestions and some other of

917
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:45,109
these features which have some privacy

918
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,299
impact in the cases like Safe Browsing

919
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:49,819
where we do use the Google service

920
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,710
because we aren't running our own we try

921
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:53,390
to at least proxy the requests to hide

922
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:58,550
the IP so we proxy the wrote brave

923
00:36:53,390 --> 00:37:01,520
service certain web api's we disabled

924
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,220
for privacy such as the hyperlink ping

925
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,250
attribute battery API web Bluetooth and

926
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:10,430
and pretty much all these or most of

927
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,900
these cases it's an API that has some

928
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,299
privacy impact but on the other hand

929
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:16,609
it's not supported across every single

930
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,730
browser so the risk of it breaking a

931
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:21,440
website is low because for instance you

932
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:25,400
know Firefox or Safari doesn't support

933
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,460
it by default either perhaps more

934
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,690
interestingly we restrict cookies and

935
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,270
refer

936
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:35,250
for third-party sites so as I mentioned

937
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:37,830
earlier third-party cookies are disabled

938
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,440
with a few exceptions we also followed

939
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:43,049
safaris lead in expiring JavaScript

940
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,630
cookies after seven days and setting a

941
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:49,590
max lifetime of six months for HTTP

942
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:52,890
cookies for refer on Eric mentioned that

943
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,990
edge is going to be spoofing or

944
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:57,839
stripping third-party ones we've

945
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:01,080
actually been doing that for about four

946
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,270
years I think on third-party sub

947
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,900
resource requests we spoof them so

948
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:08,910
instead of showing the true buffer we

949
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,190
just set it to the origin of the third

950
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,080
party being requested and for third

951
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,800
party navigations it's stripped entirely

952
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,840
this is good for privacy but also

953
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,240
doesn't have that much web compatibility

954
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,950
impact and I think there's only been a

955
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,490
handful of sites where this has broken

956
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,770
something another thing that we are

957
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,439
experimenting with but isn't yet on by

958
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:33,600
default is blocking Bounce trackers so

959
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,840
this is also following in safaris lead

960
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,670
with intelligent tracking protection

961
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:43,020
bounce trackers are these domains that

962
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:44,820
use redirects to track users so they're

963
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,050
never embedded as third parties rather

964
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:51,300
they they are used for first party

965
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:53,760
navigation redirects so for these

966
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,860
domains which we use a crawler to detect

967
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,620
when they're being used as bounce

968
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,190
trackers we just block storage API

969
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:04,109
access

970
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:06,510
so cookies local storage etc another

971
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,670
thing we do that was implemented really

972
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:11,010
recently is just filter out these known

973
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:14,790
query string trackers so in addition to

974
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:18,870
the Facebook ID we filter out GC LD and

975
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:21,270
these other ones so as I mentioned that

976
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:23,580
this sometimes causes well not this

977
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,560
exact thing but these features in

978
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:29,100
general sometimes cause sites to break

979
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:34,400
so for now we have just some lists of

980
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:34,400
hard-coded exceptions thank you

981
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:40,150
and we get to go to the part that I

982
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:43,690
think you've been waiting for which is a

983
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:49,239
bunch of discussion amongst our browser

984
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:51,489
folks here and it's interesting like we

985
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:53,940
have so many browsers here not all of

986
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:56,019
them but so many of these browsers and

987
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,729
you've all come up here and you've

988
00:39:56,019 --> 00:40:01,058
talked about different approaches to

989
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:02,769
user privacy and I want to know how do

990
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:06,569
you think collaboration between these

991
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,569
browsers helps user privacy and security

992
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:11,589
so I'm sure there's a bunch of answers

993
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:13,660
to this but when I was thinking about

994
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:15,519
this you know I think the the one thing

995
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,710
that comes to mind first is there's that

996
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,299
proverb of if you want to go fast go

997
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,579
alone and if you want to go far go

998
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:23,739
together and I feel like that really

999
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:25,839
applies here because in order for us to

1000
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:27,609
make the big changes that we need to

1001
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,950
really improve the privacy structure of

1002
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:32,348
the web we need collaboration between

1003
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,489
the browser vendors and frankly the

1004
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,130
people building websites and

1005
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:37,329
applications to sort of have agreements

1006
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,890
about what the shape of the

1007
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:41,049
privacy-preserving web ought to be

1008
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,118
because if we don't have that what we

1009
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:45,279
have is the outliers and outliers can

1010
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,930
get dismissed and so we've had cases in

1011
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,089
the past where we built things for

1012
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,979
instance an Internet Explorer that were

1013
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:53,170
you know intended to be open standards

1014
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:54,519
but not adopted by other browsers and as

1015
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,589
a consequence people just said well

1016
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,819
don't use IE use this other browser that

1017
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:59,920
doesn't have that thing because that

1018
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:02,019
thing that's just wrong that's not the

1019
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,119
way the web should be and so if we have

1020
00:41:02,019 --> 00:41:06,189
consensus and we have consistency and

1021
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,729
people building together we can help

1022
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:11,859
shape that web that we want to have I'm

1023
00:41:09,729 --> 00:41:13,569
also curious how competition between

1024
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:16,029
these browsers helps user privacy and

1025
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:18,999
security yeah I think this is a good one

1026
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:21,339
too because for instance one brave sees

1027
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:23,468
Safari rolling out this new protection

1028
00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:26,190
we think oh we should try to at least

1029
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:29,140
match that because as a privacy first

1030
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,910
privacy focused browser with that as one

1031
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,078
of our main selling points we kind of

1032
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,308
have to stay ahead of the curve so I

1033
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,009
think competition kind of pushes

1034
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:38,499
everyone towards be more private by

1035
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:40,960
default and also it's good to learn from

1036
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:42,700
other browsers especially for us since

1037
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,089
we're really small from from larger

1038
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,189
browsers that have a larger user base

1039
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:50,828
because we assume that if Safari has

1040
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,480
turned on a certain protection and users

1041
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:55,059
have not reported that much breakage

1042
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,380
then it's that's not much risk to us

1043
00:41:55,059 --> 00:42:00,880
either so it's it's really interesting

1044
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,440
are you talking about learning from each

1045
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,970
other about going together about trying

1046
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,549
new things and getting people on there I

1047
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:09,160
want to differentiate between each of

1048
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:11,740
the browsers that are represented here

1049
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,839
for I want for each of you can you tell

1050
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:16,209
me but what are the biggest differences

1051
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:21,038
between your browser the other browsers

1052
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:22,780
represented here and Safari please

1053
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:27,039
PLEASE rank your neighbor's children by

1054
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:29,799
how attractive they are so it's a great

1055
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,480
question and into just riff a little bit

1056
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:33,009
on the prior question as well I think

1057
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,470
one of the things that's nice is is that

1058
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:37,390
by having a variety of shall we call

1059
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,368
them credible browsers there becomes

1060
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,990
this privacy marketplace where ideas get

1061
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:43,420
to get tested and people move based on

1062
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:44,589
what they like and don't like so in

1063
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,599
terms of kind of where we're at

1064
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:48,430
Microsoft edge you know we have a big

1065
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:50,770
install base of a prior browser but

1066
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,899
we're competing against browsers you

1067
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,819
know chrome has the market share to make

1068
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,220
major changes in the shape of the web

1069
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:58,630
that can't be dismissed and so things

1070
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,490
that are super ambitious like the

1071
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,470
privacy sandbox it will take a long time

1072
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:04,779
and a lot of collaboration from the open

1073
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:06,038
web it is great for them to be doing

1074
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:07,569
that and you know I hear people

1075
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:09,609
screaming oh my gosh why are they

1076
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:11,680
changing things they just work and I

1077
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:13,328
would argue that that's what responsible

1078
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,029
platform stewardship looks like is not

1079
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:18,880
allowing sort of the the default to just

1080
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:21,400
get entrenched and never reconsidered

1081
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,039
and so I would say that you know we are

1082
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,750
looking a little more tactically at what

1083
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:27,309
can we do in the short term about

1084
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,079
privacy things so things like tracking

1085
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:31,480
prevention and Firefox is a very similar

1086
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:33,309
feature and so we're kind of in a

1087
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:34,839
similar realm there I would say that one

1088
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:36,250
of the things that thus far we've tried

1089
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:37,089
to do an edge is be a little bit more

1090
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,859
quiet about it

1091
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:40,299
we don't really show off the privacy

1092
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:41,859
features at the top level we don't

1093
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:43,779
generally you know there's not a lot of

1094
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:46,089
indicators saying hey we're protecting

1095
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:47,440
you in this way or that way because we

1096
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:50,109
think that that's that's what many of

1097
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,730
our users want and then you know with

1098
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,200
with brave I think brave is a very

1099
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,579
interesting position because people that

1100
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,520
are selecting brave are doing it because

1101
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:58,900
it has that focus on privacy and they're

1102
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,740
able to integrate a lot of features that

1103
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,450
I think are super cool

1104
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,299
their tour mode in particular provides

1105
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:06,890
IP privacy in a way that's not built

1106
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,960
into other browsers and so you need

1107
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:11,720
extensions for them and so I think it's

1108
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,369
super cool to have a browser that's kind

1109
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,839
of picking a lot of those advanced

1110
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:18,920
features and testing them in the market

1111
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:22,160
I kind of feel like Eric answered for

1112
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:24,860
most of us but no to actually to double

1113
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,029
down on what Eric said in terms of from

1114
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,490
the chrome side I think the biggest

1115
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:32,660
thing that we have is we have been able

1116
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:34,310
to push forward a lot of major changes

1117
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,430
that I think we're really important to

1118
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,900
safety on the web we you know the if you

1119
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:40,460
don't have the baseline of just even be

1120
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,290
able to establish a secure connection

1121
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,460
with a site like the notion of privacy

1122
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,830
is kind of silly because any

1123
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,890
intermediary can look at what you're

1124
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:50,240
doing so you know we have we you know we

1125
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:53,930
were very aggressive with mixed content

1126
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,220
early on pushing HTTP and very much

1127
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,779
leading on that and then there are

1128
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,569
things like we looked at the sort of the

1129
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:02,420
big surface areas that were causing

1130
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:05,450
problems and I think like we I would say

1131
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,760
that chrome pushed forward on and

1132
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:08,960
dealing with plugins they you know it

1133
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,840
wasn't that long ago that the web was a

1134
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,190
mix of proprietary and just very unsafe

1135
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:17,300
plugins and over several years we have

1136
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:19,609
gotten to the point where we're removing

1137
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,530
the last one from the web so I think you

1138
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:23,240
know it was starting with the really

1139
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:26,450
dangerous ones I'm sure we all remember

1140
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,979
when he you know you were likely to have

1141
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:30,350
an old version of Java that was it

1142
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:34,070
installed and you know it was very easy

1143
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:35,660
to have even a conscious yeah even for a

1144
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:37,400
conscientious user it was very easy for

1145
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,560
him to just have a drive-by exploit on

1146
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,080
their machine and we now live in a world

1147
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:43,580
where that doesn't happen anymore so I

1148
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,790
would say from the other sides I

1149
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:48,680
actually very much envy the situation

1150
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,270
that brave is in because I do remember

1151
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,919
when we were a small browser because

1152
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:54,920
chrome was less than 1% when I joined

1153
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,900
and we got to do things that you just

1154
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,760
can't like things that I can't do it's

1155
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,740
at the scale that we're at because it

1156
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,990
would be too destabilizing which is why

1157
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,640
our focus is much more on taking the

1158
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:08,660
long view thinking about what things

1159
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:11,180
look over several years and just trying

1160
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:13,730
to chart that kind of path forward it's

1161
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,250
at our scale it's just not reasonable to

1162
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:17,180
move too

1163
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:20,010
because it's too destructive and then

1164
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,690
with Mozilla I like the fact that

1165
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:25,770
Mozilla just has that level of

1166
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:27,780
Independence where they're just so

1167
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:31,650
Mozilla has I've always sort of looked

1168
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:33,660
at Mozilla as like the the the

1169
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:36,180
independent voice on the web you know

1170
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,950
they're there in it because they believe

1171
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,629
in it I think that that's a good thing

1172
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:44,040
and that's that is such an essential

1173
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:47,100
voice to the web as an open platform so

1174
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,410
like Eric said brave is smaller and has

1175
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:52,020
a more privacy focused crowd and that

1176
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:54,569
lets us be a lot more experimental and

1177
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:58,410
aggressive and what we block or filter

1178
00:46:54,570 --> 00:47:00,420
by default and sometimes we take

1179
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:03,660
something that chrome has stated like

1180
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,580
interest in doing or stated plan for

1181
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:10,290
doing in the future and we just roll out

1182
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:12,509
that feature to everyone because I can't

1183
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:15,180
do that yeah exactly so we don't have

1184
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:19,440
the same level of having to get over

1185
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:21,000
doing these things I guess and I think

1186
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,740
the most fundamental difference is that

1187
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,360
we have an alternative revenue model for

1188
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:30,629
rather an alternative to tracking based

1189
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,730
advertisement for the web and so we can

1190
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:35,160
kind of reject an entire notion that

1191
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:37,110
websites need to be funded by these ads

1192
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,450
that track you wherever you go and try

1193
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:43,770
something different and base base built

1194
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:46,740
based on that new premise so Firefox

1195
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:49,290
edge brave and Safari all have anti

1196
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,790
tracking protections by default and they

1197
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,740
all vary a little bit they all have

1198
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:54,810
different trade-offs I could bore you

1199
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,970
with all the technical details but in

1200
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:59,640
the end where we're trying all trying to

1201
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:01,350
improve those protections and we're as

1202
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,410
yon stated we're learning from each

1203
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:06,390
other on how to do that I think we

1204
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:10,290
differ from chrome and that we're not

1205
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:12,900
trying to preserve the existing model we

1206
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:15,810
see for us our highest priority is

1207
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,520
privacy so when we choose between the

1208
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:21,990
existing model and privacy we'll always

1209
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:25,800
lean towards privacy go for it

1210
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:27,240
so I think our position on this is that

1211
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,030
I think the best way to express our

1212
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,660
position honor this is that if at the

1213
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:35,550
end of the day later just oh sorry

1214
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,049
I'd say our position on this is that at

1215
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,490
the end of the day if we're pushing

1216
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,930
content off of the web and that's

1217
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:43,020
something that we're already seeing

1218
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:44,640
happen that users aren't served like the

1219
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,570
priority of constituencies of the web is

1220
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,330
absolutely user first then developer

1221
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:53,700
then implementer and and that is the

1222
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:55,049
right set of priorities but it's not so

1223
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,720
I just don't think it's fair to frame it

1224
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:59,760
as such a linear line right if the if

1225
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,200
the web isn't here in five years or it's

1226
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,210
just marginalized to the point where

1227
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,470
it's not very useful to users and I

1228
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:09,420
think we've all lost great so I I mean I

1229
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,250
personally don't think that the web is

1230
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,320
dying I understand that more and more

1231
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:16,410
users are using their mobile devices and

1232
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,210
using mobile apps and there's there's

1233
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,680
various reasons for that in some cases

1234
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:21,420
maybe it makes sense to use the mobile

1235
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,069
app instead of the browser and other

1236
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,770
cases maybe it's the website that's

1237
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:28,020
pushing the user towards the app and I

1238
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:29,640
know that the privacy landscape and

1239
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:31,350
mobile apps is much worse than what we

1240
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,420
have on the brow in browsers and

1241
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:35,400
browsers have really stepped up in the

1242
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,050
last few years and I think mobile

1243
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,390
operating systems need to do the same

1244
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,160
thing and just because the situation is

1245
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,529
bad in one area doesn't mean that we

1246
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,980
shouldn't improve it in another so so

1247
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:48,660
why don't we turn to that because that's

1248
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,520
the that is a real elf in the room here

1249
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,170
like what is the situation with mobile

1250
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:58,590
apps what is the situation with the

1251
00:49:52,170 --> 00:50:03,330
ecosystem and the privacy there I can

1252
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:06,780
start so-so you know Microsoft not

1253
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:10,319
presently in the mobile architecture

1254
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:13,680
game and so we get to be a bit of a pure

1255
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:15,900
player we love both iOS and Android I

1256
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,368
think you know this kind of gets back to

1257
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,990
something I talked about earlier of sort

1258
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:20,850
of the unintended consequence of

1259
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:23,100
potentially driving people toward

1260
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:24,660
building native applications on a mobile

1261
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,240
operating system or another operating

1262
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,560
system and so for us you know it's a

1263
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,569
company strategically it's super

1264
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,910
important that the web be competitive

1265
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,470
but but also you know there are some

1266
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,470
benefits to that and one of them as I

1267
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:37,089
mentioned was transparent

1268
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,709
the fact that you can view source on the

1269
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:39,970
web the fact that you can run fiddler or

1270
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:42,430
some other network debugger and kind of

1271
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:44,169
see what's going on and understand in a

1272
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:46,149
way like what the web application is

1273
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:48,250
doing that may be more difficult or

1274
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:50,619
nearly impossible with mobile app and so

1275
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:52,060
for instance in the example earlier the

1276
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:54,010
the mobile app that had the behavior

1277
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,359
that was a little questionable has been

1278
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:56,590
that way for a long time and people just

1279
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,200
weren't able to see weren't able to

1280
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:01,420
notice and so I think you know we think

1281
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,460
that the the open web has some serious

1282
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:05,950
benefits in in terms of its audibility

1283
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,900
and the ability to look at things but I

1284
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,069
will say and you know there was the

1285
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:12,070
question earlier about how do you

1286
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:13,660
compare with with Safari and I think you

1287
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:15,880
know I can't speak for Safari but I will

1288
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:17,560
say that there is you know undercurrent

1289
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,510
an undercurrent of all of this a

1290
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,759
question about sort of the heart of the

1291
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:23,050
web and so you know we talked about some

1292
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,970
of the benefits of the web around its

1293
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:26,710
ephemerality its openness and its

1294
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:28,509
standards the fact that you can just go

1295
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,550
anywhere and look at anything and so

1296
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,260
like those are all benefits and there

1297
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,599
are people that feel like that and

1298
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,940
simplicity are the value of the web and

1299
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:39,730
then an alternative use as effectively

1300
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:41,349
if the web isn't capable and competitive

1301
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:43,540
as an application platform it will

1302
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:45,190
ultimately lose and so that's what goes

1303
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,440
into project of things like project fugu

1304
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:49,450
about enhancing the capability is the

1305
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,400
web platform in order to be capable of

1306
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:54,129
replacing native apps and bring more

1307
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,200
openness to these things and so we are

1308
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:57,820
pretty much in that camp we recognize

1309
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,160
the simplicity of the web as a serious

1310
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,960
value but also if the web just kind of

1311
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,970
stays the way that it is of you know a

1312
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,010
way to view documents into very simple

1313
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,230
form filling we don't think it's going

1314
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:10,000
to last we think it will effectively get

1315
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:13,000
less and less of the users time and less

1316
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,250
and less of the attention and so mobile

1317
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,050
apps you know as tombi pointed out you

1318
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:18,520
can make you know operating systems

1319
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:21,550
because they're behind stores can

1320
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:23,320
actually put requirements in and so both

1321
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:25,599
Android and iOS have previously

1322
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,130
announced like requiring HTTPS for all

1323
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,770
the mobile apps and data transfers and

1324
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:32,020
things like that but it's hard to move

1325
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:33,369
those things you know in the same way

1326
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,770
that it's hard to move the open web and

1327
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:37,599
so ultimately we think the web is great

1328
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:40,630
and we would love to see everything

1329
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,890
built on web time I would like to add

1330
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,810
one just point I should point to that

1331
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:45,040
which is I think when we just talk web

1332
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:46,299
versus mobile we're sort of missing

1333
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,420
what's going on in the landscape here

1334
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,610
which is that you have

1335
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,560
mobile platforms yes but you also have

1336
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:54,750
these super apps things like WeChat and

1337
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,610
Facebook and that that you know they

1338
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,260
cross various different platform or

1339
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:59,970
various different platforms underneath

1340
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,680
them and they are their own platforms

1341
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:03,390
and theirs in themselves with entirely

1342
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,779
different privacy constraints etc and

1343
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:08,160
they are very opaque to us so I I think

1344
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:11,550
we have to take a broader look at like

1345
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,680
the entire landscape and if essentially

1346
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:15,240
we are pushing content off of the web if

1347
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:17,370
we're pushing people off of the web and

1348
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,140
into places where there really is no

1349
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:21,390
visibility I do think that that users

1350
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:26,609
lose because they are getting materially

1351
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:29,549
worse privacy and security yeah I I

1352
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:31,710
think though we do have to look at this

1353
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:34,350
holistically but I don't think that that

1354
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:36,210
means the browser's need to stop they're

1355
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,650
anti tracking efforts I think that means

1356
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,300
we need to get legislation and

1357
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:41,550
regulation in place to help in these

1358
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:44,010
other situations where we have we don't

1359
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:46,290
have control or we don't have the

1360
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:49,800
leverage Eric you have some experience

1361
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:51,930
on that one so so I think Justin's

1362
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,790
leading to one of the things I mentioned

1363
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:55,560
earlier was the p3p standard the

1364
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:57,300
platform for privacy preferences and

1365
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,940
sort of the anecdote there was this is a

1366
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,260
feature that effectively gave us some of

1367
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,700
the things we're trying to build now or

1368
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,110
basically if you were a third party

1369
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,490
cookie you had to declare what you were

1370
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,750
being used for and the browser would

1371
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:09,359
automatically block your third-party

1372
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:10,620
cookie if what you were using it for was

1373
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,360
not sort of either what the user

1374
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,549
reasonably would expect or what they had

1375
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,830
configured and so when I first came over

1376
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:18,300
to the IE team I'm like man this is the

1377
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:20,220
dumbest thing I've ever seen like

1378
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,780
websites can say whatever they want and

1379
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,060
the browser will blindly accept it and

1380
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,740
it was explained that at the time the

1381
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,259
reason that ie built this feature or

1382
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,939
circa 2000 was there were like 26 state

1383
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,010
attorney general who came to Microsoft

1384
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,630
and said if you build this I will get

1385
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,850
promoted to governor when I sue

1386
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:38,190
companies for violating this and so

1387
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:40,319
basically the enforcement mechanism was

1388
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:42,600
legal system and Tim berners-lee in his

1389
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,250
book basically you know he flat-out said

1390
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,960
this is won't be enforced technically we

1391
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:48,630
have existing fraud statutes that it

1392
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,550
will enforce it well p3p did end up as a

1393
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:53,010
variety of lawsuits all of which

1394
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:56,340
effectively got dismissed priorities in

1395
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:57,570
the country changed after 2001 in terms

1396
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,280
of the sorts of things that people were

1397
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:01,500
looking to investigate but at the same

1398
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,780
time regulatory systems have kind of

1399
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,030
rolled

1400
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:06,220
and we're seeing things ge PRC CPA

1401
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:09,190
things like that where there is now

1402
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,500
again an interest in doing things around

1403
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,270
regulation and potentially finding

1404
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:15,220
violators and ensuring that people are

1405
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:16,420
meeting their privacy promises and so I

1406
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,430
think we do need a hybrid approach

1407
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,770
though because there is you know the

1408
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:22,720
risk if you build a technical mechanism

1409
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,670
which is dependent on the law it's going

1410
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,830
to take a long time for that to be

1411
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:28,210
enforced but sometimes we need it and so

1412
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,819
one of the things Justin alluded to is

1413
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:32,740
this idea of IP blinding where web

1414
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,480
service can say we're going to discard

1415
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,830
your IP address and not do anything with

1416
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,540
it and that's something you could

1417
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:39,759
imagine writing a statute around which

1418
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:41,830
is understandable and unambiguous and

1419
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,120
potentially enforceable in many of the

1420
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:46,950
jurisdictions that people have to

1421
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:49,660
operate and so I think we do need both

1422
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:52,210
if anybody is gonna have questions

1423
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:54,009
get your questions queued up start and

1424
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:57,820
start lining up at the mic so I'm gonna

1425
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:59,410
ask another question here since we're

1426
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,810
talking about policy in law already how

1427
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:05,170
can policy and law people help improve

1428
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:10,150
user privacy on the web yes so I I

1429
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:12,010
stated some of this before legislation

1430
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:14,890
and regulation actually have a leg up

1431
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:17,440
when it comes to privacy over security

1432
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:19,450
because the attackers in that context

1433
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,360
are law-abiding companies not

1434
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:25,180
underground hackers so I think that they

1435
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:27,220
can have real effect here and we need

1436
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,759
really need a combination of policy and

1437
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:33,220
technology to improve privacy on the web

1438
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,590
and it's not my area of expertise but

1439
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:39,810
Mozilla does have a team that is

1440
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:45,220
engaging globally on data protection law

1441
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:51,150
so my take is that I think there like I

1442
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:53,830
would point to things as like the FDA or

1443
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:56,460
you know other regulatory bodies were

1444
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:58,600
they like okay they create legislation

1445
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:00,790
that essentially empowers a regulatory

1446
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,080
body of expert and does things I think

1447
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,850
those sorts of things can work out well

1448
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:06,009
and I do think we need those sorts of

1449
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:07,290
things for privacy what concerns me is

1450
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:12,040
when we have the opportunity to build

1451
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:14,890
stronger technical measures and we

1452
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,610
instead if we instead say no this is

1453
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,620
this is

1454
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:19,360
distillation if we you know and choose

1455
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,190
to build soft technical measures instead

1456
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:23,020
I want us to build robust technical

1457
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:24,820
measures I want us to have frameworks

1458
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:27,700
that we consider to be strong and

1459
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:29,320
genuinely enforceable through contract

1460
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,509
law and then the and then ideally

1461
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,580
regulatory bodies would actually be able

1462
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:37,390
to to point to those and to use those

1463
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:39,430
but I'm very much worried when I don't

1464
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,400
know so when we take the when I hear

1465
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:43,720
something that sounds too much like

1466
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,160
pushing the product of the problem off

1467
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,470
to regulators because I think history

1468
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,960
has shown that we are not very active

1469
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,370
and engaged at using levers levers at

1470
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,950
our disposal the technical means at our

1471
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:56,080
disposal the contractual means artists

1472
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:58,240
bogles disposal then regulators will do

1473
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:02,259
things that have very perverse

1474
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,790
unintended consequences okay so we're

1475
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:10,450
gonna move to user questions now

1476
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:12,070
our audience questions now okay when you

1477
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:14,169
before you ask your question please

1478
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,670
state your name and affiliation cuz I

1479
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:19,230
know most of you in line but I'm not

1480
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:27,130
sure everybody does I'm surprised the

1481
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:30,180
unaffiliated Eric you're making the same

1482
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:34,080
mistake I am you gotta lean into the mic

1483
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:36,940
okay okay right on it okay

1484
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:39,490
Eric Rose unaffiliated it's cool that

1485
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:42,340
you have all this competition in browser

1486
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:44,560
features those are really neat but it

1487
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:47,260
here's a feature I would like to have if

1488
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:51,310
all of you could agree to define a bland

1489
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:53,430
browser where bite for bite the same

1490
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:56,520
exact bites would go to the web site

1491
00:58:53,430 --> 00:59:00,640
when I say open a link in a special mode

1492
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:02,710
that would allow me to open a link

1493
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:05,259
without revealing anything even about

1494
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:08,290
which browser I'm using and that would

1495
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:11,380
require some collaborations you all have

1496
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:14,250
to agree on what that bland browser is

1497
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:16,810
but but the example I would use is

1498
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:18,850
somebody mentioned do you use a loyalty

1499
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:20,560
card at the grocery store and not only

1500
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:22,480
do I not use a loyalty card I don't even

1501
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,430
use a credit card I use cash because

1502
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,640
that really looks makes me look exactly

1503
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:28,990
like all the other people using cash

1504
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,910
unfortunately the clerk says oh yeah

1505
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:33,339
you're the one person here he uses cash

1506
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:35,830
I don't say it's a silver bullet but

1507
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:38,020
that's something that would be a really

1508
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:40,569
nice feature to have especially if it's

1509
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:43,480
really fast it's like you know some kind

1510
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:46,020
of a keyboard shortcut so I could say

1511
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,130
open this link without revealing

1512
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,410
anything it just makes me look

1513
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:55,030
completely like everyone else okay you

1514
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:56,500
have filed a feature request does

1515
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:59,680
anybody on the panel want to say

1516
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:02,800
anything about this feature request I

1517
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,020
think we all have opinions on it I think

1518
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,310
you know the general idea is is a good

1519
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,810
one right users don't want to have to

1520
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,070
think they just want the right thing to

1521
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:11,350
happen and so you know the immediate

1522
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:12,940
response to that is okay well you know

1523
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:15,069
you're sending your requests over tcp/ip

1524
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:15,670
you have not a key address I know where

1525
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,500
it's coming from

1526
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:19,030
and so we start getting into features

1527
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,710
like okay well how do you do that

1528
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:22,840
anonymous a ssin of the original

1529
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:24,760
location you get it into the fact that

1530
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,800
you're gonna then in entrench the

1531
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,420
capabilities of the browser and say that

1532
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:30,250
as browsers get new features they can't

1533
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,260
be used until they're in all rendering

1534
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:34,119
platforms and in some respects that's

1535
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,320
desirable that's kind of the idea of

1536
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:37,650
commoditizing

1537
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:40,450
and standardizing on the web platform

1538
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:42,490
but at the same time I think you end up

1539
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:46,000
constraining a lot of the innovation and

1540
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:47,200
you may end up in cases where sites just

1541
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,180
don't work or don't have the

1542
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,939
capabilities you want and so it is it is

1543
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,680
certainly a trade-off that being said

1544
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:56,080
there is currently one proposal around

1545
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,850
user agent sniffing where you know we

1546
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,470
are a chromium based browser but we have

1547
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:01,540
a token that reveals ourselves to be

1548
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:02,980
edge and we have already seen certain

1549
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:06,009
websites that will service different

1550
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,150
markup than chrome perhaps a you know

1551
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,790
we're not supported in your browser

1552
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:11,650
please use Chrome and kind of say but

1553
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:14,290
that's the downside of being a small

1554
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:16,359
browser we are effectively chromium and

1555
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:18,640
so you know I think there are places

1556
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:20,230
where we will strive to be byte for byte

1557
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:23,140
identical and as I understand it brave

1558
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:25,450
spoofs the chrome user agent string I

1559
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,980
think we do for now but in the future

1560
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:30,368
we're not going to and it's also getting

1561
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:32,020
more more pointless because like yes you

1562
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:33,790
can beat the user agent from the header

1563
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,410
you can also run a lot of JavaScript to

1564
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,660
figure out what the browsers are because

1565
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:40,420
we block so much that we are pretty

1566
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:42,319
distinguishable from chrome yeah the

1567
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:44,150
other pieces and sometimes this isn't

1568
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,010
intentional and so for instance when we

1569
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:49,850
first were building our beta builds of

1570
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:51,470
edge the the Google guys helpfully added

1571
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:53,330
us to their user agent sniffing library

1572
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:55,009
so that my Google properties would know

1573
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:57,410
when a user is visiting with edge which

1574
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:58,790
is useful for a variety of things but

1575
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:59,990
they also had some sites and services

1576
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,060
that had the list of browsers they

1577
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:04,189
supported and they didn't update the and

1578
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:07,310
we're also supported in that edge and so

1579
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:10,820
by doing certain kinds of mimicking or

1580
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:13,370
mimicry or freezing of things you can

1581
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:16,670
improve the state of compatibility and

1582
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:18,620
potentially privacy okay and I'm also

1583
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:20,590
gonna ask the next person to state their

1584
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:25,069
question in the form of a question

1585
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:28,670
sorry Eric me go hi I think Nick is

1586
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:30,140
boskie Google so my question for you I

1587
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:33,200
guess maybe everybody what you're saying

1588
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:35,870
because I think one over there but the

1589
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:38,240
economic model of advertiser like did

1590
01:02:35,870 --> 01:02:41,000
you really consider their incentives

1591
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,439
like as long as you are I think fairly

1592
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,660
small internal market share I don't

1593
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:47,150
think they the advertiser are really

1594
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:49,549
going to invest into technology trying

1595
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:52,220
to bypass it bypass particularly the

1596
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:53,900
protection you put in place but after

1597
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:56,600
you without like significant market

1598
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:58,550
market share what what would ruin them

1599
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:01,940
from doing like additional changes like

1600
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:03,920
a cname hosting like seems like warning

1601
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,510
on the same side having script included

1602
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,600
as part of the script of the website

1603
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:10,580
just to bypass your protection like a DM

1604
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:13,150
what's the endgame well yeah what an

1605
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:16,370
game you're trying to get to and you

1606
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:18,680
proactively investigative like red team

1607
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:22,509
like the consequence or your differences

1608
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,509
and how people are going to defeat them

1609
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:27,290
for me I think the question is for for

1610
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,800
everybody you should totally answer it

1611
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:33,980
okay

1612
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:38,780
okay Justin you got a - yeah so we know

1613
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:40,580
that our that we can't protect against

1614
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:42,710
every tacking mechanism which is part of

1615
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:44,330
why we have our policy and look we look

1616
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:46,040
for circumvention and when we find

1617
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:48,410
circumvention we can apply additional

1618
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,090
restrictions the cname aliasing attack

1619
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:51,920
is an attack that we need to address in

1620
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:53,810
the future and we are constantly

1621
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:55,400
enhancing and working on our protections

1622
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:58,150
to try to figure out how to attack these

1623
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,150
different mechanism

1624
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:02,220
yeah a lot of ways it feels like a

1625
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:03,750
cat-and-mouse game

1626
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:05,939
like if you're blocking gets better than

1627
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:08,310
like people's evasion evolves stills to

1628
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,230
get better but I think a point that's

1629
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:12,330
often missed is that just by blocking

1630
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:15,300
really easy tracking targets like third

1631
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:16,770
party cookies you prevent you actually

1632
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:18,690
have like huge privacy benefits because

1633
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:22,470
a lot of a lot of websites won't bother

1634
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:23,910
to try the more advanced techniques but

1635
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:25,410
I think the argument there was it at

1636
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:28,980
smaller scale I think that's that's

1637
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:30,089
totally fair at larger scale that that

1638
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,160
just does not work anymore

1639
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:34,500
I mean that's been that has been our

1640
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,830
experience with things that are not like

1641
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,599
a robust firm boundary that the

1642
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:43,650
cat-and-mouse game at scale is

1643
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:45,960
unwinnable I mean we're in the same

1644
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:48,240
place with security right like we we

1645
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,430
constantly our child there's constantly

1646
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,098
new security attacks and we're we're

1647
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:55,020
never done we we always have a job when

1648
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:57,180
it comes to security and with privacy

1649
01:04:55,020 --> 01:05:00,090
it's the same thing we're just starting

1650
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:01,529
this now okay I actually I you actually

1651
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:03,210
very much disagree with that one just

1652
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,470
because with security our focus I'm

1653
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:06,089
actually really impressed at what all of

1654
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:09,540
us have done on security over the last

1655
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:11,490
decade or so where we have built robust

1656
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:14,040
boundaries things that are enforceable

1657
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:15,750
is it perfect no but we have built like

1658
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,430
layers of defense defense in depth and

1659
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:19,859
and that's what I want us to do for

1660
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:22,529
privacy because I look at what the web

1661
01:05:19,859 --> 01:05:24,330
was like 10-15 years ago and they're

1662
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,020
like it was literally just way too easy

1663
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,819
to get owned

1664
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,619
whereas today it's we're in such a

1665
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,720
better place and it's because we all

1666
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:31,859
work together and put in big investments

1667
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,410
and did that and that's what I want to

1668
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:36,509
do for privacy and I think that that's

1669
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:40,560
where we've that's the direction that

1670
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:42,500
we're headed I think the other thing

1671
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,670
that I would mention that this kind of

1672
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:46,500
subtext of that question is like

1673
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:48,720
effectively if you're pushing billions

1674
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:51,119
of dollars around people will react and

1675
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,589
so what do you do and so one of the

1676
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,599
things that's nice about this sort of

1677
01:05:52,589 --> 01:05:56,310
marketplace of ideas and browsers right

1678
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:57,960
now is is if there are a variety of

1679
01:05:56,310 --> 01:06:00,330
ideas some of them very old and

1680
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:03,180
previously unsuccessful but maybe things

1681
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:04,650
have changed and so as I understand it

1682
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,000
Mozilla has been looking at some

1683
01:06:04,650 --> 01:06:07,560
alternative funding models there's

1684
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,359
things like oil and things like that

1685
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,140
where there's potential other ways of

1686
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,420
supporting website

1687
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:14,879
and brave has the basic attention token

1688
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,349
idea and things like that then Microsoft

1689
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,730
we haven't announced anything but we're

1690
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:19,440
also watching what other people are

1691
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:21,779
doing and we have some ideas of our own

1692
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,190
on that front and so I think you know an

1693
01:06:21,779 --> 01:06:24,720
alternate way of stating it you know

1694
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:27,210
Justin kept saying I can't do that I

1695
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,399
can't do that and you know the reality

1696
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:31,319
is is that you can't do it because you

1697
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,630
would get sued you would never succeed

1698
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:35,130
in doing it people would abandon your

1699
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:36,630
platform at high rates and things like

1700
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:39,140
that and so as you become a major

1701
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:40,769
browser there is that sort of

1702
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:43,109
requirement that you be a little bit

1703
01:06:40,769 --> 01:06:44,879
more conservative but also I'm sure that

1704
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:46,980
if there's another mechanism that takes

1705
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,839
off and it's doing great we're gonna see

1706
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:50,970
it spread to the other browsers it's

1707
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:53,640
just in the alternate monetization

1708
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:55,500
mechanisms thus far they've all

1709
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,779
effectively failed in favor of

1710
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,279
advertising and so if that's to change

1711
01:06:57,779 --> 01:07:01,349
its going to be something that is new

1712
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:04,529
and it's gonna be based on you know the

1713
01:07:01,349 --> 01:07:07,250
new reality of the world we we have seen

1714
01:07:04,529 --> 01:07:09,599
contextual advertisement examples of

1715
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:11,089
contextual advertising succeed where

1716
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,559
there haven't been revenue impact

1717
01:07:11,089 --> 01:07:16,170
there's a German company called cobbler

1718
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,599
the New York Times changed all their

1719
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:23,250
European ads to be contextual after gdpr

1720
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:26,640
and and there's a few more I would say

1721
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:28,349
that some of the arguments there are not

1722
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,868
like I've seen the arguments I haven't

1723
01:07:28,349 --> 01:07:33,359
actually seen the evidence backing that

1724
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:35,789
up and when you like when you actually

1725
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:37,078
meet with the people literally on the ad

1726
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:39,450
tech side of like the New York Times

1727
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:42,269
they they paint a very different picture

1728
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:47,879
I think that contextual advertising has

1729
01:07:42,269 --> 01:07:51,689
a lot of room to grow and evolve okay on

1730
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:53,430
the left hi Mike Michael new from

1731
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:55,619
digital ocean I'm associate general

1732
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:57,930
counsel there so first I want to say

1733
01:07:55,619 --> 01:08:00,180
this is more of a question directed to

1734
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:02,460
Yann although I'm sure others will have

1735
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:04,259
opinions about this as well you know

1736
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:06,240
myself and a number of my friends we are

1737
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:07,619
big fans of the brave browser and we

1738
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:11,160
actually our company actually advertises

1739
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:13,079
on brave so my question is you know

1740
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,940
there was an era

1741
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:17,040
I guess now it seems like ancient

1742
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:19,560
history where Microsoft was embroiled in

1743
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,359
this battle where everyone thought it

1744
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,770
was crazy this idea that browsers were

1745
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,400
going to be the next operating system

1746
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:25,109
and now we don't

1747
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,460
use the word where it's operating system

1748
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:28,469
very often anymore

1749
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,969
and I think my opinion is that we

1750
01:08:28,469 --> 01:08:30,719
haven't really fully left that era other

1751
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:33,000
now we're talking about mobile

1752
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:36,120
environments as being perhaps more

1753
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,799
important now so my question for brave

1754
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,899
in particular one of the things I think

1755
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:43,679
makes brave great is that it is a fork

1756
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:45,839
of chromium or the version I use and so

1757
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,859
does brave any have any concerns or

1758
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,469
should there be any concerns about

1759
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:53,009
anti-competitive activity in the browser

1760
01:08:49,469 --> 01:08:56,609
ecosystem in this day and age what do

1761
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:58,589
you mean so for example like brave one

1762
01:08:56,609 --> 01:09:00,000
of the great things about brave that if

1763
01:08:58,589 --> 01:09:01,109
you're transitioning from using chrome

1764
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,179
is that you're still able to use a

1765
01:09:01,109 --> 01:09:05,699
number of the features that could the

1766
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:07,710
chrome ecosystem offers but that doesn't

1767
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:09,599
necessarily have to always be the case

1768
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:11,969
right now I'm curious if brave kind of

1769
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,460
has a long term vision for either kind

1770
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:16,890
of being parallel to or deviating from

1771
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:19,429
that based on the relationship with the

1772
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:23,130
other browsers yeah at least for now

1773
01:09:19,429 --> 01:09:24,658
chromium was just the easiest platform

1774
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:26,819
for us to build off of so I don't think

1775
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:28,799
we have any plans to transition off of

1776
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:31,679
it we actually in the last two years

1777
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:33,689
transitioned from electron which was

1778
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:37,920
this not at all designed for public

1779
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:39,719
browsers platform to chromium which is a

1780
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:43,649
browser and look that was that's

1781
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:45,179
resulted in a lot of improvements one

1782
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:47,608
other thing I would say is as a chromium

1783
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:49,770
fork you could imagine there was a great

1784
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:52,109
deal of concern from Microsoft about

1785
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:54,239
throwing away 25 years worth of code and

1786
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:56,969
we platforming on an open source project

1787
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:58,290
where 90% or something like that of the

1788
01:09:56,969 --> 01:10:01,230
contributions came from one of our

1789
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:03,090
largest competitors and I will say that

1790
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:05,250
you know there are places where it makes

1791
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:07,469
sense to distinguish chromium from

1792
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,400
Google and you know one of the points

1793
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:10,020
that I had brought up when this

1794
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,420
conversation originally came up about

1795
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:13,890
read platforming is a great number of

1796
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,230
the people who work on chromium are

1797
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:18,179
effectively artisans or digital

1798
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:19,440
craftsmen who build it because they

1799
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:21,679
think it's the right thing to build and

1800
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:24,120
Google happens to be their patron and

1801
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:27,420
one of the points that I made was that

1802
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:29,070
if Google took steps to reduce the

1803
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:30,659
openness of chromium or otherwise

1804
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:32,940
interfere with the state of the goals of

1805
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:34,138
the project they would end up losing the

1806
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,599
people that were really making that

1807
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:37,290
project successful and so I think it's

1808
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,540
certainly good

1809
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:40,920
you you know have an eye on sort of the

1810
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:42,690
underlying politics about all of this

1811
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:47,250
but also I think it's important to draw

1812
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:50,700
that distinction next on the right Rick

1813
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:52,460
Ferro unaffiliated I would love to see

1814
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:55,650
the web take a different direction

1815
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:57,450
meaning that sort of being funded by

1816
01:10:55,650 --> 01:11:00,179
advertising which I don't trust and I

1817
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:02,429
don't like I find distracting that we'd

1818
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:05,610
be able to make micro payments right now

1819
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:10,440
I know brave does this to an extent but

1820
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:12,719
they still show advertisements a the

1821
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:16,349
owner of a website gets fractions of a

1822
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:18,090
second set usually for a view you know

1823
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:20,760
you have to click through before now it

1824
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:22,800
becomes a penny or two so I'd love to be

1825
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,110
able to make make micro payments so and

1826
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,530
if you have plans to support this in the

1827
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:30,420
future I think that content developers

1828
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:33,679
would actually make more money getting

1829
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,730
pennies than they do getting web views I

1830
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,590
mean I guess that's easiest for me to

1831
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:40,860
answer because we already do support

1832
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:43,530
that um and I think a problem with that

1833
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,920
is at scale it's hard to get people like

1834
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:46,050
you

1835
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,330
well obviously like you and me and like

1836
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:50,820
people like us would happily contribute

1837
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:52,860
our own money to websites but for a lot

1838
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:54,240
of other users it's hard to get them to

1839
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,769
do that because they're used to the web

1840
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,120
being free and if there's something

1841
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:58,650
that's free and suddenly it cost money

1842
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,490
that's like very strange to them

1843
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:03,870
especially if the payment is optional so

1844
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:05,910
yeah that's a challenge but micro

1845
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:07,830
payments is something we offer just look

1846
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:11,340
at ad blockers it's getting to be a

1847
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:13,559
bigger percentage go ahead I was just

1848
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,360
gonna say that I would absolutely love

1849
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,160
to see microsiemens succeed I know there

1850
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:20,730
have been a bunch of efforts at Google

1851
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:23,910
and various other companies to do it it

1852
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:26,400
turns out that the payment industry

1853
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:28,200
itself is really really complicated and

1854
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,540
there are players in there that expect a

1855
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:33,120
fairly large cut and so long as that

1856
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:34,920
exists I don't really understand I I

1857
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,340
don't know if there's a path forward for

1858
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:40,500
micro payments i but i agree i think

1859
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,590
that if we if we if we could pull that

1860
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:45,480
off it would definitely replace a large

1861
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:49,659
portion of what people rely on for

1862
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:52,419
advertising thanks on the left

1863
01:12:49,659 --> 01:12:54,579
all right my user name is Gabriel DeWitt

1864
01:12:52,419 --> 01:12:56,229
I'm affiliated with the advertising

1865
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:58,389
industry please don't throw things at me

1866
01:12:56,229 --> 01:13:01,239
I'm the vice president of product at

1867
01:12:58,389 --> 01:13:04,179
index exchange Global Ad Exchange and my

1868
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:06,999
question is and first thank you all for

1869
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:09,219
an elucidating conversation how can the

1870
01:13:06,999 --> 01:13:11,769
ad industry work with you guys so that

1871
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:14,860
we avoid sort of the fall outs like with

1872
01:13:11,769 --> 01:13:17,050
GDP our wine and even what's happening

1873
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:18,969
somewhat with CCPA in other words you

1874
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:21,669
know changes happen very quickly we feel

1875
01:13:18,969 --> 01:13:24,249
sort of out of the loop we also care

1876
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:27,159
about users privacy despite I think a

1877
01:13:24,249 --> 01:13:28,809
lot of opinions but we also have to you

1878
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:31,329
know support the industry of making

1879
01:13:28,809 --> 01:13:34,499
money work and paying publishers so how

1880
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:36,639
can we collaborate together thank you

1881
01:13:34,499 --> 01:13:38,978
okay I guess I can take this one because

1882
01:13:36,639 --> 01:13:43,949
you know I assume that's what everyone's

1883
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:47,650
expecting so I think one of the best

1884
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:49,598
forums right now is the WC web

1885
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:51,179
advertising business group that sort of

1886
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:55,479
that's the only like standards-based

1887
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:57,429
forum that exists today and there's been

1888
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:59,169
some very good work going on there I I

1889
01:13:57,429 --> 01:14:01,809
would like to see all the browser's

1890
01:13:59,169 --> 01:14:03,159
represented there and we're not quite

1891
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:08,650
alike although we're not quite there yet

1892
01:14:03,159 --> 01:14:10,860
to be honest I know that the w3c more

1893
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:15,159
broadly would like more partnerships

1894
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:16,780
with industry where essentially the

1895
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:18,610
industries that are impacted by the web

1896
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:21,938
are represented and I do think that's

1897
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:23,949
very important I I know personally on

1898
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:25,209
like obviously because of the industry

1899
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:28,900
that we're in worst but we spend a lot

1900
01:14:25,209 --> 01:14:30,188
of time talking to to all comers and I

1901
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,018
think that's important for browsers we

1902
01:14:30,189 --> 01:14:34,989
have to think of everyone that are

1903
01:14:32,019 --> 01:14:36,909
relying on the web as a platform so we

1904
01:14:34,989 --> 01:14:39,938
can take one last question as long as

1905
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:43,179
everybody is short about it okay so my

1906
01:14:39,939 --> 01:14:46,269
question is is there anything we can do

1907
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:48,849
to stop like an anti privacy browser

1908
01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:50,919
from entering the space kind of cuz we

1909
01:14:48,849 --> 01:14:54,340
have a lot of governments and say other

1910
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:58,959
things that aren't really hot or like

1911
01:14:54,340 --> 01:15:01,329
you know to enthrall develop privacy so

1912
01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:03,190
that's a super interesting question

1913
01:15:01,329 --> 01:15:05,349
I think everybody's

1914
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:07,509
competition lawyers just had some kind

1915
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:08,830
of heart attack right I'm gonna answer

1916
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:12,670
I'm gonna answer a different question

1917
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:14,650
instead which is we've seen certain

1918
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:17,650
cases where for instance the government

1919
01:15:14,650 --> 01:15:19,360
of a country decides that everyone must

1920
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:20,650
install their route CA so they can

1921
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:23,769
invent in middle all their network

1922
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:26,650
traffic and so how do you deal with that

1923
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:28,900
as an industry and the answer is yes for

1924
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:31,030
competition reasons largely we don't

1925
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,920
talk directly to the other browsers and

1926
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:34,780
come up with a course of action we

1927
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,489
independently look at what we're going

1928
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:38,800
to do what we've previously said we're

1929
01:15:36,489 --> 01:15:41,199
going to do and then try and drive it

1930
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,560
now it's a desirable for all of us to

1931
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:48,099
have a certain level of consistency in

1932
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,570
that answer because if for instance you

1933
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,250
know two out of the four browsers two

1934
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:53,949
out of five browsers implement a

1935
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:55,210
protection and the other ones don't then

1936
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:57,790
the government just says hey the

1937
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:59,469
official browser of our country is this

1938
01:15:57,790 --> 01:16:02,560
other thing and we'll put you in jail if

1939
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:05,710
you don't use that browser and so when

1940
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,420
nation-states come to play things get a

1941
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:09,190
lot more complicated you end up with

1942
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:11,500
executives of your company in jail

1943
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:14,049
because you know you're not playing

1944
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:16,270
along with the party line and so I would

1945
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:18,250
say that nation-state attackers are a

1946
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:21,400
very different thing that requires a

1947
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:23,080
different set of different set of

1948
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,820
inventions whether it's going to the US

1949
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,440
government and saying hey did you see

1950
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:30,239
this because we're worried about this in

1951
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:32,830
terms of democracy but I think privacy

1952
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:34,718
you know a lot of the commercial things

1953
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:36,430
or things that were sort of better set

1954
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:39,540
up to handle even though they're not

1955
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:41,739
simple problems either okay so we are

1956
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:43,540
sadly over time and I know this has been

1957
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:45,699
a fascinating conversation probably some

1958
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,170
of more of you have questions if you

1959
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:48,339
