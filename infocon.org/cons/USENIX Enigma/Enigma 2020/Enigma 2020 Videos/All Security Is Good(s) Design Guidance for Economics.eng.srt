1
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,730
I want to talk about changing the

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,270
economics of the network she talked

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,400
about culture I'm talking about money so

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,420
I want to talk about the control plane

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:35,190
the control plane is what connects the

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,480
Internet it is the internet is a network

7
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,640
of networks oh you've heard that a

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,489
thousand times how do these networks

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,920
connect well they connect through the

10
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,919
control plane which is defined by the

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,630
border gateway protocol why does it call

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,060
that because if you have a network of

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,820
networks when those networks touch

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:57,210
that's a border it does not refer

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,149
initially to international borders BGP

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:05,970
directs traffic step-by-step hop-by-hop

17
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:10,350
so that it arrives now why is BGP

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:14,340
interesting in terms of attacks and

19
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,610
vulnerabilities well BGP is not that

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,069
easy to map you can't draw a map like

21
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,500
this necessarily even though routers

22
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,740
have placed so suppose you wanted to

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,399
send something from FedEx from Tullahoma

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,280
to Memphis it may go to Madison if FedEx

25
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:35,729
has a center there and if it does it

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,060
goes to Madison every single time just

27
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,170
like your postal realms BGP routes are

28
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,229
not like that

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,750
well for one reason because in BGP it

30
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,479
might make sense to go I don't know

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,810
across town in Denver by driving to

32
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:56,640
Kansas and why would that make sense

33
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,560
well because the fibers and the networks

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,160
are owned by different people

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,590
if you PS you've owned all the roads

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,530
across town in Denver it would make

37
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:12,180
sense for FedEx to drive to meet Kansas

38
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:15,709
so why does it matter because if there's

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:19,290
no control plane there's no internet and

40
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:22,560
if there's no secure control plane none

41
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,660
of our goals can be met if I can

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,460
interrupt and reroute all your

43
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,299
transmissions remember the very first

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,670
opening set

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,130
when they were saying oh yes back when

46
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,510
we had these tiny tiny little key sizes

47
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:38,430
and we see everyday innovations in

48
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,340
cryptography we have a better

49
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,420
understanding of selecting keys so your

50
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,340
session keys cannot always save you and

51
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,290
if they can't save you then you're not

52
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,150
going to have an integrity in your data

53
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,850
and even if your crypto was perfect and

54
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,610
secure you it is possible to just a

55
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,980
black hole data so basically what

56
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,880
happens is internet pass changed very

57
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,799
rapidly

58
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,060
some of them changed back and forth all

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,720
the time they just flap back and forth

60
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,350
like Oh

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,420
Kansas not Kansas you know Internet they

62
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,930
can change very rapidly and once you

63
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,059
hand that packet over to BGP that's it

64
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,010
right so take these super secret

65
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,670
incredibly important intellectual

66
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:29,190
property nuclear code memos across the

67
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,390
country okay that's fine but you know

68
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:35,070
maybe I'll sell them first so one of the

69
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,380
things I've liked about this conference

70
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:41,370
is the introduction slide so why do I

71
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,560
care about something like BGP and why am

72
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,410
i making an argument that it is

73
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,590
legitimate to take a political and

74
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,890
economic perspective on something this

75
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,410
fundamental that is because I am a fish

76
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,910
who swims in two waters I have spoken at

77
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,209
the White House in the National Press

78
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,280
Club and RSA and black cat I changed in

79
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,680
four thermocouples at Catawba Nuclear

80
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Station and I was I think the only

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,930
person at Catawba South Carolina nuclear

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:15,570
station who thinks that it is awesome

83
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:17,910
that I was in the house gallery you know

84
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,320
around the edge when Obamacare was

85
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:25,230
finally passed into law so just like I'm

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,800
an intersection so is BGP it's a

87
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:32,220
fundamental problem so one of the the

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,680
very first hearing on Capitol Hill about

89
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,760
computer security they brought up the

90
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,040
fact that BGP could be hacked I wanted

91
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,020
that I hung it

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,540
one of the then young men from loft he

93
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,240
became a DARPA program officer said I

94
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,810
can bring down the entire Internet in 15

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,420
minutes and we've seen that happen in

96
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:58,500
other countries if you look at some of

97
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:03,120
the internet takedowns the in Egypt and

98
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,990
Syria in India they've gone much farther

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,200
than this

100
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,390
it's basically a BGP attack it's a

101
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,640
fundamental problem it's foundational

102
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:15,570
technology and we've made very little

103
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,719
progress why is that well I believe that

104
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:22,050
I have an answer to why that is and it's

105
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,860
the economics so I'm going to argue not

106
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,170
just about BGP but more largely than if

107
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,810
we think about security as a thing if we

108
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,270
bring in economics and think about how

109
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:36,360
to only make it so that everybody wants

110
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,359
this by aligning investment in benefit

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,320
by design we could have a more secure

112
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,180
internet I mean in terms of the privacy

113
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,880
I will come back to that panel and say

114
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,670
it's a lemons problem it's a market

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,770
problem so what is this hijacking I keep

116
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,980
talking about it is not like carjacking

117
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:59,310
so I picked this equine attack because

118
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,840
bitcoin heist so as you know we all know

119
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,210
bitcoin is a distributed ledger

120
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,609
cryptographically signed technology

121
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,989
that's implemented where you gain value

122
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:12,660
by coming by calculating the correct

123
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,970
matching hash right so that's computer

124
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,720
intensive so people get together they

125
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,400
form a big club they call it a pool they

126
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,830
search collectively

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:28,650
and then they get the rewards and they

128
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:33,210
share them so there was a large mining

129
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:35,520
pool and they used Amazon servers Amazon

130
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,849
Cloud Servers to coordinate not to do

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,010
the mining ain't go Amazon it turns out

132
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,720
they set it up with no passwords or

133
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,010
security so if anybody wants to talk to

134
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,760
me about the brilliance of Bitcoin

135
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:51,300
miners I have the whole reception um so

136
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,190
what the attacker did was said hmm maybe

137
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,370
I'll just tell

138
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:59,190
the world that this tiny little slice of

139
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,340
the IP space that the miners are using

140
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:05,630
that's in Canada I get to say evil

141
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,070
Canadians which you never get to say so

142
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:12,990
this evil Canadian and there is only one

143
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,320
was able to get tens of thousands of

144
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:20,700
dollars with super quick bursts of

145
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:24,000
incorrect control plane information so

146
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,349
why do people commit crime is this a

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,780
criminal problem

148
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,270
there are basically three arguments that

149
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,760
are popular in crime science today one

150
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,859
is routine activity if you are walking

151
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,469
down the street and you saw a lot of

152
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,590
cash on the sidewalk you pick it up and

153
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:44,580
say you know rejoice I must purchase

154
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,929
better wine for Jeanne because actually

155
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,400
legally what you should do is you should

156
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,810
pick it up and you should take it to the

157
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,460
cops and you should describe when you

158
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,410
picked it up and they'll hold on to it

159
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,180
for X days and then if nobody comes and

160
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,169
explains they left this amount of money

161
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:01,770
you know a very fuel very few of us are

162
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:04,080
that good I mean it would take you hours

163
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,990
and also it's cash right but that's

164
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,500
literally a literally a crime right to

165
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,120
take it unsecured wealth the lack of

166
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,970
social support I'm sure you've heard

167
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,800
about the broken window theory that says

168
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,360
if there's no social support they'll be

169
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,280
more crime and relative economic

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,860
deprivation I mean here we have a

171
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,659
picture of a wonderful young man who

172
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,090
spent all morning stealing a loaf of

173
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,750
bread and then gave it to orphans if you

174
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:36,289
remember your Disney but relative

175
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,460
economic deprivation is particularly

176
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:42,150
strong on the Internet

177
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:45,630
because we have people as you noted from

178
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:48,300
all over the globe with tremendously

179
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,300
different standards of wealth where what

180
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,300
I would be annoyed by and write off as

181
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:58,079
my credit card would change would you

182
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,270
know cover their rent for a month so if

183
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,460
you look at these crime theories and you

184
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:04,260
think how can we measure this well was

185
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,100
routine activity theory you can say all

186
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,019
right their economic rationale

187
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,600
we're gonna look at available targets

188
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:13,660
and lack of oversight because frankly if

189
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,730
you pick up $200 off the ground you're

190
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,399
never going to get busted for it that's

191
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,730
part of it part of it is culture lack of

192
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,700
social support endemic practice lack of

193
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,320
oversight if there's no deterrence and

194
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,380
relative economic deprivation which is

195
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,600
just GDP per person I mean so we like to

196
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,029
DDP per person and secure Internet

197
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,370
servers and relative exports and we took

198
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:39,070
a lot of variables and we found that

199
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:44,100
there were some significant hotspots

200
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:46,750
that crime theory could absolutely

201
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,250
identify this is this is what is

202
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,899
happening this is a crime that is

203
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,750
happening just like smuggling we have

204
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,420
hot spots for hijacking there were also

205
00:09:52,750 --> 00:10:00,610
some other places that stood out and if

206
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:02,680
you recall a map of underground fibers

207
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,170
the reason for some of these is obvious

208
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,089
right it's just where the fibers are it

209
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,640
makes it easier if you have a lot of

210
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,829
routers but there are some countries

211
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,310
that kind of stood out and they stood

212
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:18,699
out consistently across all Donita in

213
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:22,540
2014 cisco bought bgp mon and so the

214
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:26,859
data sharing is not the data sharing

215
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,449
changed and we so what we did is we we

216
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,029
clustered them we said all right we did

217
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:34,449
our multivariate regression to look at

218
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,760
crime and some of these things just did

219
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:39,010
not make sense so basically we looked at

220
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,500
secure internet servers which is

221
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,140
availability and access and how much

222
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,449
internet there is and mold governance

223
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:49,720
indicators which is how much crime there

224
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:51,939
is and you can see how you could draw a

225
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,660
line through that which is part of what

226
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,420
we got from our multi variant analysis

227
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:01,689
but there was a part of it that really

228
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:07,990
just did not make sense there are some

229
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:10,810
real outliers in this and when we looked

230
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:13,750
at those outliers we found something

231
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,910
kind of interesting which is that

232
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,010
excluding Comoros which is the little

233
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,920
tiny island with all the fibers coming

234
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,500
into it and all

235
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,829
the other drivers going out of it these

236
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:28,730
are places with either active conflict

237
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:31,819
or long-standing civil strife so there

238
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:35,540
was a good argument that something else

239
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:38,389
is happening besides crime so we have a

240
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:41,180
very serious problem and we all have to

241
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:44,000
work together to secure BGP because it's

242
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,880
not like your browser I can choose to

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,300
secure my own browser I cannot choose to

244
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,839
secure my own BGP so how do we make that

245
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,199
work

246
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:57,139
well it's a coordination problem I could

247
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:59,240
spend the rest of the talk trying to get

248
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:03,170
everybody who is in this room and

249
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:06,320
similarly aligned and completely

250
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:09,050
gracious and willing to help to move one

251
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,449
seat to the left just think about how

252
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,510
difficult that is in this kind of

253
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:16,490
coordination in this little space so how

254
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:20,149
do we do that how do we increase the

255
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:23,630
investment and uptake of secure routing

256
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:27,829
we redefine the problem as economic and

257
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:29,959
change the nature of the good so the

258
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:33,260
idea is if we look at the economic

259
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,599
threat we can change the economics of

260
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,980
BGP to beat that threat and if you want

261
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,589
to use the market you have to have a

262
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,010
market that functions the goods have to

263
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:45,170
have some basic characteristics or the

264
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,079
market doesn't work right the guys have

265
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,089
to be rival risk which means if I eat a

266
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,609
cupcake that cupcake is gone that

267
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,649
consumption is rival risk you cannot

268
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,140
have my cupcake it needs to be

269
00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:00,560
exploitable which means I can protect my

270
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,480
cupcake from other hungry people and it

271
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,000
needs to be transparent which is like

272
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,199
this is definitely a cupcake

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,180
it is not a lemon and when you have

274
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,890
these kind of failures you get different

275
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,949
kinds of goods and the problem with

276
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:18,639
public goods is we don't have a way to

277
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:21,529
invest in global public goods

278
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:24,170
now goods that are non-excludable but

279
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,420
rival risks you're going to invest much

280
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,699
more than you would in a public good and

281
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,740
similarly for glumph goods that are

282
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:31,800
excludable and nonrival risks to give

283
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,580
you examples and

284
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,569
just names obviously cupcakes ready for

285
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,240
lunch

286
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,100
fisheries are non-excludable I cannot

287
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:47,600
keep you off the ocean but if you catch

288
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:49,980
a fish I cannot catch it and that was a

289
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,060
non-excludable and nonrival risk

290
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,399
experience of sound all right so it's

291
00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,660
gluten ball and nonrival it's like a gym

292
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:04,230
membership we can all hug go to the gym

293
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,510
I did not pay them to do that so we can

294
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,370
change these weight the way we do

295
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:12,390
security we can change it like IP

296
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,820
addresses are non-excludable but rival

297
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:19,490
risk so if I claim an IP address and

298
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:23,100
your traffic is there that is I and

299
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:27,750
email I can I can keep you out of my

300
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:30,950
email right but I can't prevent someone

301
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:34,500
else from reading from copying the email

302
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:37,740
so other kinds of goods can be changed

303
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,510
by design so phishing detection we see a

304
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,589
lot of sharing clothes sharing

305
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:46,290
information groups incident data and I

306
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:49,950
believe that we can change bgp updates

307
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,380
of course most goods are not pure goods

308
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:55,170
they're mixed they're a cupcake in the

309
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,680
gym so traditionally my work has tried

310
00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:03,510
to change the nature of goods here we go

311
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,370
by for example when I owner abilities we

312
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,110
all know about bug bounty programs and

313
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:10,350
the market for vulnerabilities before

314
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:12,720
bug bounty programs there was a young

315
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,970
man er people were arrested on the stage

316
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,890
and DEF CON for exposing of

317
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,290
vulnerability because not only could you

318
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:23,520
not you can only sell it to criminals

319
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:25,939
that was a problem so what are hijacks

320
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,430
are they a crime it's linked to spam

321
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:31,709
it's linked to malware and deep packet

322
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,449
inspection is linked to both so I wanna

323
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:37,140
make an argument that in addition to

324
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:40,229
machine learning and clustering there is

325
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:43,920
a real reason to believe there are

326
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,390
nation-state actors so beautiful Denver

327
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,060
people go there for this ski

328
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:53,310
there was a month-long hijack of the

329
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,380
traffic in Denver why is that well

330
00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:00,150
because Denver outside of Denver is

331
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:04,770
actually the concentration of America's

332
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:08,370
surveillance infrastructure NORAD the us

333
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:14,040
NORTHCOM Cheyenne Mountain the recently

334
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:16,380
named space force and there's also a

335
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,120
building that everybody claims isn't

336
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,850
there but is there because I've seen it

337
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,820
and so if it existed it would probably

338
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,590
be associated with surveillance also

339
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,960
Peterson Air Force Base the Air Force

340
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,930
Academy and bike the Air Force Base so

341
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,150
all that's in a tiny little area and

342
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,069
interestingly enough as you saw in my

343
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,410
example it might make sense to go

344
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:38,010
through Kansas because FedEx owns the

345
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,160
roads

346
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,180
so sometimes Denver to Denver

347
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,020
Communications goes from Denver to

348
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,709
Dallas to canvas to Denver for months it

349
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,590
went from let me see let me see if I can

350
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:56,700
do this Denver to Chicago

351
00:16:51,590 --> 00:17:01,100
yikes Denver to Ashburn to London to

352
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:06,660
Iceland which was a hacked IASP that was

353
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:08,760
generally generally reported that it was

354
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,560
owned by the Russians at the time that

355
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,900
this attack was happening and then it

356
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,230
went back from Montreal this was not

357
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:21,150
detected at the end point because the

358
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:23,880
delays were so so insignificant so how

359
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,829
can we solve this well the first panel

360
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,830
would tell you we need better crypto we

361
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:31,110
always need better crypto I mean crypto

362
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,500
is the oxygen of security if we don't

363
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,350
have it we can't do much so there's been

364
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,710
two proposals on the table for a very

365
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,719
long time which is resource public key

366
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,450
infrastructure basically says this is my

367
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,340
IP address you can't have it and BGP SEC

368
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,280
which says this is my IP address and

369
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,220
this is where it should go

370
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,139
so PKI origin value validation it just

371
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,070
says I'm going to associate the network

372
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,850
with the origin and that can stop

373
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,280
both IP address hacking and black and

374
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:08,459
black holing which means that you send

375
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:14,129
your data to an IP address and BGP takes

376
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:17,490
it to you no dev null it deletes it but

377
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:20,700
it can't do anything about BGP hijacking

378
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:25,520
and as long as BGP hijacking is a

379
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:29,010
problem we're going to be systematically

380
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,270
structurally fundamentally vulnerable so

381
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:35,550
BGP SEC offers full pass validation not

382
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,320
only is this my IP address but this is

383
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,090
my IP address and this is the correct

384
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,740
top and then this is the correct next

385
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,419
step and this is the correct next step

386
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,340
and we are all exactly where we should

387
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:50,010
be right of course

388
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:52,740
BGP it would be more like but it only

389
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:56,570
identifies trusted connections if we

390
00:18:52,740 --> 00:19:00,930
trust everyone with a public key so and

391
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:02,909
it the wall it's only as high as its

392
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,160
shortest point so if there's a part

393
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,140
where it just kind of Peters out and you

394
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,960
can walk around it you can hijack it it

395
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,740
also requires that we trust the public

396
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,350
key of every participant so if we're

397
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,290
willing to trust I don't know Putin's

398
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:21,659
public key then sure we can roll this

399
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,970
out and then we would know things were

400
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,680
being hijacked as soon as we looked just

401
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:32,580
like they are now only with more crypto

402
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:36,690
so one of the ways I want to encourage

403
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,970
people to invest in things that help to

404
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,670
generate technologies that help the

405
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,660
person who invest in it so mismatches

406
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:48,750
between the autonomous system where

407
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:53,400
something connects to and it's the

408
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:57,650
jurisdiction are uncommon traffic

409
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:01,770
leaving San Francisco to go to San Jose

410
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:05,220
typically does not go through China it

411
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:07,680
did for a while when the US had a bunch

412
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,480
of soldiers in Afghanistan so Facebook

413
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,960
traffic actually went through China for

414
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,640
a while so traffic starting in one place

415
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,860
ending in the other place doesn't need

416
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,660
to go through any of these places but it

417
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,659
has gone through all of those places I

418
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:30,210
am in my research arguing for individual

419
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:32,520
autonomy the thing about I don't think

420
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:36,300
we will ever come to a time when we all

421
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,910
have shared values but we should be able

422
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:42,180
to express our own risk perceptions and

423
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:44,880
values on the internet without impinging

424
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,900
others I think we should be able to

425
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,450
choose one select a path and then say I

426
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,460
only want this data to go out if it goes

427
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,110
through this path I want it to go

428
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,670
directly there I don't want it to go

429
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,750
there there there there there there

430
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,800
there and there

431
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:06,570
and to do this to show you that this is

432
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:10,860
possible we created a route reflector we

433
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:13,860
named it Bongo because zebra is a famous

434
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:18,479
open-source product and quagga is but

435
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:21,240
Bongo is the ungulate with horns it's

436
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,430
the one that can fight so this is just

437
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,010
basically a picture that says we use

438
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:28,700
Bongo we put it between and it can work

439
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:33,360
with different architectures including

440
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:38,220
architectures for you know cloud data

441
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,560
clusters it works with Sdn and so

442
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:44,670
basically how can an organization

443
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:46,830
mitigate data exfiltration it can choose

444
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,080
to use there we go so much for animation

445
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,540
it can choose not to send the content

446
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,820
that is all you can really do today but

447
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,620
you can do that on the other hand if it

448
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,300
was widely adopted by individual

449
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:03,929
organizations hijacks would be

450
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:07,500
identified much more quickly so we

451
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:09,810
tested this on 50 financial ISPs well

452
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,030
the only one that dropped off and our

453
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,090
theoretical run is if we all had bongo

454
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:17,879
was the main bank and Iran and for some

455
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:20,939
reason it has very bizarre routing

456
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:24,150
patterns sometimes against Russia

457
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,739
sometimes it gets to Germany sometimes

458
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,379
it goes through a Mon

459
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:32,769
so if we understand hijacks is criminal

460
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:36,699
and economic as well as nation-state

461
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:40,779
that uses routers and wires that are in

462
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:44,889
specific very real countries with very

463
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:47,080
different priorities and cultures we can

464
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:49,389
do politically and economically inform

465
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,399
design to solve those different kinds of

466
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:53,399
problems thank you for your attention
