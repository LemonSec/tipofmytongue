1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,100
well hello everyone my name is Frances

2
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,630
user now and I'm here today to present

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,700
to you the catch me if you can

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,009
presentation in which I'm going to show

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,540
you how we were able to narrow down and

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,150
define the number of techniques and

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,560
categories malware families uses in

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,629
order to they every controlled

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,190
environment to provide a little bit of

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,450
context at this research and

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,430
presentation was only made possible

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,350
thanks to the help and tenacity of

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,300
fashion enter hello who's present right

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,550
here thanks to in the helping hand of

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,559
enigma Holland is a senior security

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,540
researcher at the learner in Tina and

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,550
she is currently the leader of the cocoa

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,410
Sundberg Pershing which was the help in

19
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,480
hadn't needed in order to understand how

20
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,959
Mauer are able to evade such

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,489
environments as apparently mentioned my

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,409
name is Francie here now I'm also

23
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,110
security researcher data in Argentina

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,150
I'm part of the thread library team

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,850
where I dedicate myself into the

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,970
collection analysis and documentation of

27
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:20,520
threat groups my fever incident and

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:22,620
malware families in order to do this

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,080
presentation a little bit more practical

30
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,940
and easy to understand we divided it

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,649
into four different sections the first

32
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,149
one is going to be based on the

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,570
environment award owners master

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,610
technique which and the same time the

35
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,100
purpose behind this whole research which

36
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,840
is going to be a pretty short one in the

37
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,220
second section I'm going to explain the

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,900
five different categories within

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,929
environmental warrants and each of

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,670
techniques that we were able to define

41
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:49,200
at the same time after each at each

42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,450
category I'm going to show multiple

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,760
malware families examples in order to

44
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,490
show how they attempt to abuse such sub

45
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,470
techniques finally I'm going to show how

46
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,890
we were able to use what we learn in

47
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:06,960
order to profile and track apt groups to

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,669
start off we need to understand that the

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,739
attackers always decided that the

50
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,890
malware pieces arrived to the their

51
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:17,519
desired victims so they will attempt at

52
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,048
all cost to avoid that their malware is

53
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,970
going to be analyzed by security

54
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:23,519
researchers nowadays most malware

55
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,040
families use at least one evasion

56
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,349
technique in order to avoid this this is

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,410
why we needed to define a technique in

58
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,970
order to on

59
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,000
understand how they are capable of doing

60
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,620
this and how and we also needed to

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,570
define old methods and maneuver they

62
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,110
used in order to take one of three

63
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:43,450
things sandbox in environment a virtual

64
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:49,720
machine or the presence of any forensic

65
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:52,089
tools to start off I'm going to show you

66
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,070
how we all day categorize that we were

67
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,530
able to define we define five different

68
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,870
categories and every sub technique that

69
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,600
is contained within this cutter these

70
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,750
techniques can wide Aiken range in a

71
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,180
wide spectrum of complexity varying from

72
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,130
very simple and yet effective technique

73
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,070
in order to discern if the system is

74
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,100
real or not to a way more complicated

75
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,170
ones and sophisticated each category

76
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,140
ends to a specific perspective of the

77
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,700
system and this is often abused by the

78
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,230
malware in order to uncover the true

79
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,040
nature and to see if the compromised

80
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,410
system is suitable or not by doing this

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,700
my work and also attackers can also

82
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,440
perform multiple tasks and in order to

83
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,839
to show that malware to capabilities or

84
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,770
hide it by executing Eboni behavior or

85
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,750
abruptly ending its own execution to

86
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,160
start off we define we were able to

87
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,930
define the system architecture a

88
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,120
category which aims to collect

89
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,640
information about how the system is

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,650
composed physically the first sub

91
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,079
technique systematic specifications

92
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,170
tries to get information about the

93
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,870
methods that rely on how the system is

94
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,880
composed itself as an example we have

95
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,220
the CPU core count which is the number

96
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,200
of CPUs the system has the available ram

97
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,370
memory are just some these properties

98
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,810
such as the size or available partitions

99
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,870
also we have the system footprint which

100
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,120
is a pretty common one is when malware

101
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,250
uses communication between system

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,380
components and this operating system

103
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,900
such as the basic input/output system

104
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,480
the bios the unified extensible firmware

105
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,630
interface the UEFI and extensive

106
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,310
favorite interface the efi finally we

107
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,200
have the hardware components which

108
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,229
attempts of the information about the

109
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,289
hardware itself such as the thermal

110
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:42,950
readings on a computer checking if the

111
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:44,990
system has any

112
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,270
printers keywords on Mouse which would

113
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,190
be a peripheral check or checking the

114
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:54,169
hardware LEDs such as the serial number

115
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:56,300
the model or the manufacturer Li ID in

116
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,460
order to show a little bit of example we

117
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,560
took a Cisco Telus report based on

118
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,570
gravity Brad we've devised a pretty

119
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,460
sophisticated remote access version that

120
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,130
contains seven different innovation

121
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,520
techniques in order to discern whether

122
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:14,030
the system is virtualized or now in this

123
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,799
case in system architecture the malware

124
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,719
has three different techniques the first

125
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,240
one aims to obtain the thermal readings

126
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,160
of the system if not in not if no

127
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,110
thermal readings are available or that

128
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,910
or the heat level is above normal

129
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,590
gravity rise is going to take it that a

130
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,470
virtualized machine is being executed on

131
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,869
the system and it's going to exit in the

132
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,610
second technique gravity right aims to

133
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,040
obtain the processor Aidid the device ID

134
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,840
and the system name and it's going to

135
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,400
compare the retrieves things against a

136
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,409
blacklist in order to identify the name

137
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:48,229
of any virtualization vendors such as

138
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:50,420
VirtualBox or PM work the last technique

139
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,120
very tierod aims to obtain the number of

140
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,250
CPU cores that it the system has in this

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:02,480
case if the numbers is equal to one

142
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:04,040
gravity radius once again go into X the

143
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,480
second category that we were able to

144
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,060
define his system background this is a

145
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,890
pretty long one sorry everyone it's

146
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,040
composed of six different sub techniques

147
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,780
the first one being system architecture

148
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,400
in this category all sub techniques aims

149
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,500
to perform any background related

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,320
verifications in the first step

151
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,030
technique the system our obtains to

152
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,650
obtain information about the

153
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,619
communication between Harmer components

154
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,359
and with a specific inputs is going to

155
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,490
obtain information about environment as

156
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,780
an example we can have the CPU ID based

157
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,790
instruction or the WMI queries following

158
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,950
up we have the processing services this

159
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,780
is a pretty common one seen across

160
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,229
multiple malware samples in which the

161
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,890
malware

162
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:49,190
attempts to look any any suspicious

163
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,510
process running on the system and that

164
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,930
is known to belong to a virtualization

165
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,760
vendor additionally we also have the

166
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,639
registry keys where the malware can look

167
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,009
up for doors

168
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,349
case there are no to be related to a

169
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:06,090
specific learner like this one that is

170
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:08,460
known to be from VirtualBox a pretty

171
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,989
sophisticated one which is pretty neat

172
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,789
is the MAC addresses

173
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,860
Maur are able to obtain the MAC

174
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:15,539
addresses available on the system they

175
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,430
can get this information and comparing

176
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,039
once again to a privileged previously

177
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:22,710
loaded blacklist in this case we can see

178
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,389
a number of MAC addresses that garbage

179
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,340
route it attempts to search in the

180
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:30,719
system they are related to the network

181
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,878
adapter we can also create a unique

182
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:35,159
identifier of the system this is mostly

183
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,789
is seen on generic profiles

184
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:40,169
loaded into systems in which the the

185
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:41,729
malware obtains to create a unique

186
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,878
identifier of the system based on the

187
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:48,240
difference information available on the

188
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:50,430
compromised environment and at last we

189
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,689
have the artifice persons where malware

190
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,439
can check if any suspicious tools or

191
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:59,360
applications are installing in the

192
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,360
system by checking the available drivers

193
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,199
once a we have gravity read and in this

194
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,969
case the priority red is using to WMI

195
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,770
queries in the first one its attempted

196
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:12,930
to obtain information about the

197
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,460
manufacturers of the system it's going

198
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,409
to serve for the scene the VMware the

199
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,430
VirtualBox or just the name Bertil that

200
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:21,210
is going to be suspicious

201
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,250
we're also performs a WMI query down

202
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,289
below there in which is going to compare

203
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,789
it against add the bios and it's going

204
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:28,469
to convert the information against a

205
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:34,049
blacklist once again which we can see

206
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:35,578
there being were VirtualBox etc as I

207
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,140
previously mentioned gravity is also

208
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:38,848
capable of routine the MAC addresses

209
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,519
available on the system that are related

210
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,140
to the network adapter it's going to

211
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,029
compare it to the blacklist and it's

212
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,730
going to discern whether it's going to

213
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,370
exit or continue its own execution and

214
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,010
the last gravity rod is going to perform

215
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,290
a registry key query searching for any

216
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,790
additional tools used by the IP rights

217
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,790
or various install on the system

218
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,449
malware also abuses a feature that is

219
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,030
present on the sandbox in environments

220
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:13,510
where the sandbox is going to execute

221
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:16,270
analyze malware malware only for a short

222
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,670
period of time this is why malware often

223
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,949
abuses this specific category for

224
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,900
example the malware can sleep for a long

225
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,700
period of time in order to delay its own

226
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,800
execution this is why they are going to

227
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,670
abuse that limitation and they are going

228
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,620
to escape those environments another way

229
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,959
where malware can take an abuse this is

230
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,730
using the windows API called the get T

231
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,280
account in order to obtain the system

232
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,340
uptime if the system has been recently

233
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,140
recruited is going to take it that as is

234
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,380
a sandbox environment and it's going to

235
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,720
once again X a pretty funny one which is

236
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,060
a time Bob it's some sort of a quote

237
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,710
unquote good through which is a date

238
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,709
that the malware is going to be executed

239
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,450
on let's say animal world is going to be

240
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,270
executed on the New Year's Eve only

241
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:06,040
Friday the 13 or the April Fool's Day

242
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:07,960
and that's a real one also malware can

243
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,880
have used a schedule and download this

244
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,530
is often seen in the first stage malware

245
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,830
where they the first stage my work

246
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,540
creates a scheduled download in order to

247
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:20,140
delay the arrival of the second stage

248
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,959
payload and the last is system events or

249
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,390
malware with not executed itself after a

250
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,430
certain trigger or event of course that

251
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,860
is unlikely going to happen in a sandbox

252
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:35,620
in environment such as a system reboot

253
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:38,080
or a user log off as an example we

254
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,640
decided to use the opener family I hope

255
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,390
there I'm pronouncing that correctly

256
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,100
sorry Arun and it's going in this case

257
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,650
we can see the instructions inside at

258
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,980
the border where the opener is using the

259
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:53,350
windows API get get account and it's

260
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,590
going to compare that value obtained

261
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:59,980
value against this hero AF P 74 which is

262
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,450
roughly 12 minutes if the if the value

263
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,280
is less than 12 minutes

264
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,020
Oh Peter determines that the system is

265
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,020
not trustable and it's going to exit

266
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,320
my were often abuses the fact that

267
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,079
automated analysis lacks of you know

268
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,019
human interaction where users tends to

269
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,029
move the mouse click or type on their

270
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:25,279
keyboard which is defined as a user

271
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:28,209
interaction some boxing environments in

272
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,130
turn runs with little to no user

273
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:33,079
activity a good example can be the fake

274
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,380
installers that prompt the user to clip

275
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,638
multiple buttons or checkboxes also

276
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,860
checking the user properties and

277
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,940
configuration which is called once again

278
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,550
quote unquote

279
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,769
the mass of the user is when the malware

280
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,439
searches for documents available in the

281
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:52,100
temp folder recently opened documents or

282
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,990
shortcuts in the desk finally we have

283
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,029
this software amply and applications

284
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:59,029
where the malware is going to attempt to

285
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,339
obtain information about applications

286
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,410
are installed in a system there are not

287
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,759
going to be likely installed in a

288
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,149
sandbox environment such as a

289
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:10,399
communication application such as Skype

290
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:16,310
email a software such as Gmail or a

291
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:18,199
video player we need to know that

292
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,329
microsoft office documents such as

293
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:22,760
PowerPoint are able to execute macros

294
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:26,630
such as a PowerShell script this is

295
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:30,490
often seen over a mouse click or a mouse

296
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:32,720
over an object in power in in PowerPoint

297
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,790
we took another example from the

298
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,220
financially motivated Finn's 7 group in

299
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:39,050
which they prompt the user to click the

300
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,690
document in order to execute the real

301
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,490
knackers behind that and after clicking

302
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,290
that a dacoit document is going to be

303
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:51,860
displayed and the markers will start

304
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:53,660
executing the last category that we were

305
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,029
able to define was the network network

306
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,920
visitation this category aims to obtain

307
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:01,040
information about all interconnected

308
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,180
devices with the system itself as an

309
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,829
example it's going to attempt to obtain

310
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,870
information about the connectivity

311
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,969
availability to see if the communication

312
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,470
between the malware and the command and

313
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,990
control server of the attacker is

314
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,399
trustable or not also it's going to

315
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,560
attempt to obtain information about the

316
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,230
open ports and search for those that are

317
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,638
uncommonly used in order to see if they

318
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,470
belong to a virtualization a

319
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,930
virtualization vendor or a forensic

320
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,220
application

321
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,439
analyst is going to they can also

322
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,649
perform a network check in order to see

323
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,600
a complete list of users that are

324
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:34,310
related to that specific network and in

325
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,070
order to obtain information such as the

326
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:44,989
name of the of the system the assertion

327
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:46,730
or the related I piece as an example we

328
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,420
decided to use the power shell Empire

329
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,829
tool this tool is pretty pretty neat it

330
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,399
uses multiple situational awareness

331
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:57,979
modules and many of those are are based

332
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,920
on the network check in this case powers

333
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,440
partial Empires is running a user hunter

334
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,579
in order to obtain a full list of users

335
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,680
that are connected to the same network

336
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:10,040
it's going to obtain information such as

337
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,050
the user the computer name or the

338
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,630
related appease if no users are

339
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:20,120
connected to the same network the

340
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:22,430
malware is going to exit as a result of

341
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,850
this on the whole research we were able

342
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:29,839
to get all malware samples that contain

343
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:32,300
any environment awareness techniques in

344
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,040
this case we thought that 30% correspond

345
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,459
to threat group that are suspected to be

346
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,709
located in China 28% from unknown

347
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:43,520
origins to a person are suspected to be

348
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:47,270
from Russian origin and 7.37 4.5% from

349
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:49,760
North Korea additionally we were able to

350
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:52,069
identify the top layer of each region as

351
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,260
well as their preferred category in this

352
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,529
case we can see that a PT one often uses

353
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,260
a sleeping method that is going to be

354
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:03,890
allocated into the time based detection

355
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:05,689
TI 505 uses the system background a PDA

356
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,420
which was heavily influenced aided by

357
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,699
the potion buyer malware uses the

358
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,529
network based detection and hide a

359
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:14,750
hiding Cobra as well as a PT one

360
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:16,279
preferred to use an extended sleep which

361
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,399
is often related to the time based

362
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,399
detection

363
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,170
also thanks to this research uh Shannon

364
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,779
and I were able to define a technique in

365
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,000
two or pre-vet framework which was same

366
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:33,290
environment awareness this is only made

367
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,449
this was only made in 2018 in 2019 mitre

368
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,019
attack updated their own framework the

369
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:39,349
one that we

370
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:41,869
daily use this framework was updated

371
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,579
with the T 1497 virtualization cybox

372
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:45,230
evasion technique and we were able to

373
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:47,019
provide feedback to them in order to

374
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,699
compare it and have it up to date

375
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:52,549
thanks to this we were able to improve

376
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,589
on the apt inside knowledge we were able

377
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:57,259
to identify apt overlapping through

378
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:59,569
multiple groups as well as we learn how

379
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:03,709
to detect these techniques and we gained

380
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:04,790
that knowledge as some closer remarks we

381
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,189
need to understand that the evasion

382
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,719
techniques are constantly evolving we

383
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:11,209
need to stay aware we need to keep on

384
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,809
researching and we need to keep sharing

385
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:16,939
this with the whole industry we need to

386
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:20,238
use different profiles for our sandboxes

387
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:22,099
and avoid using generic ones if we use

388
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:24,379
generic ones malware is going to be able

389
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,949
to run a system fingerprint and is going

390
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:30,350
to always avoid it and at last but not

391
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:32,959
least is that we need to keep all system

392
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,939
up-to-date in order to avoid maurer

393
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,609
exploiting and already known bullying

394
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:39,349
abilities with with all these and a

395
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,699
special thanks to enigma I say goodbye

396
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,699
and welcome to questions
