1
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,400
so the goal of this talk is to get you

2
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,439
up to speed on what's going on in the

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,598
world of cell network security dispel

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,910
some common myths particularly around MC

5
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,410
catchers and to explain why it's so hard

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,900
to fix some of the fundamental issues

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,099
and phone radio security specifically

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,100
we're going to look at the root cause

9
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,230
behind many of the solar cell network

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,940
attacks from the last few years and also

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,739
discuss issues the research community

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,629
has been dealing with while trying to

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,220
address these issues we're going to

14
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:44,870
start out by talking about MC catchers

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,030
because that's a topic that's both

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,379
technically and politically relevant but

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,890
ultimately the scope of this talk will

18
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:54,290
be quite a bit broader so you may have

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,960
heard of stingrays or MC catchers or by

20
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,729
their more general term cell flight

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,589
simulators these are devices that

22
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:02,379
masquerade as cell towers in order to

23
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:05,539
collect information from nearby phones

24
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:07,100
very little is known about commercial MC

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,600
catchers they're shrouded in secrecy

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,580
because they're only sold to law

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,350
enforcement and federal agencies under

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,420
very strict NDA's by the device

29
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,589
manufacturers and the secrecy has

30
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,479
resulted in there being a slew of

31
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,820
confusion and myths about what these

32
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:23,600
devices are actually capable of so

33
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,939
here's one of a few images of one that

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,710
exists in the public domain admittedly

35
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:31,939
this is for an older model called the

36
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:34,009
Stingray which is made by Harris Corp in

37
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:36,469
practice they're used for both targeted

38
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,270
and dragnet surveillance as for what

39
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:40,189
skill they operate on when it comes to

40
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,960
dragnet surveillance there's some leaked

41
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:43,939
marketing materials for a model called

42
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,158
the trigger fish which is also made by

43
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,979
Harris Corp which advertises that it can

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,679
collect signaling data from 60,000

45
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,600
devices simultaneously we also know from

46
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,829
Canadian public records that certain

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,210
commercial empty catchers have a

48
00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:00,908
functioning range of at least two

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:03,350
kilometers so there have been many

50
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,689
high-profile cases regarding the use of

51
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,460
MC catchers in the last few years you

52
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:09,258
may you may remember last year that news

53
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,390
broke but there were MC catchers all

54
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:13,160
over DC being used to spy on politicians

55
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,750
and lawmakers but that the government

56
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,890
didn't have the resources to figure out

57
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,420
where they were or how to find them we

58
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,190
also know that they're being used by CBP

59
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,230
and IC e to hunt down on documented

60
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:26,200
immigrants aclu recently requested

61
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,119
documents regarding these

62
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,040
use of these devices which we know they

63
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,230
possess because in a 2016 government

64
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,940
oversight report they reported having

65
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,340
spent 13 million dollars on this

66
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,470
technology ultimately they didn't turn

67
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,440
over any documents and so the ACLU

68
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,359
recently filed a lawsuit in response so

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,590
despite not knowing much about the

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,140
technical inner workings and

71
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,090
capabilities of modern commercial AMC

72
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:53,290
catchers we do however know the original

73
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,709
MC catcher has worked on patent

74
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,359
documents but I'm going to go over that

75
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,920
but before I do I need to go over some

76
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,750
terminology to make sure we're all on

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,458
the same page so first when I say base

78
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,500
station that's the more general term for

79
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:10,450
cell tower or anything that behaves like

80
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,670
a cell tower including emcee catchers in

81
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,078
terms of Network generations the

82
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,470
relevant ones I'll be talking about are

83
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:19,660
gsm LTE and 5g so GSM is the oldest cell

84
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,349
network standard still in use and is

85
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,760
referred to as being part of 2g LTE is a

86
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,530
more modern set of cell network

87
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,030
standards which I'd say is the most

88
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,069
commonly used cellular standard for

89
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,859
phones currently and it is referred to

90
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:34,600
as being part of the as part of 4G some

91
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:38,620
of the main differences between LTE and

92
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,450
GSM include faster data rates and better

93
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,790
transit encryption algorithms if you're

94
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,470
curious and then there's 5g the newest

95
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,108
standard of which the first draft was

96
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,389
finalized in March 2018 the defining

97
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,889
improvements are really just higher data

98
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:56,799
rates and increased capacity on the

99
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:59,319
network so first where they called em

100
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,030
Skechers so they're called that because

101
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:03,310
there's a unique ID on each SIM card

102
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,840
called an MC this ID is meant to be kept

103
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,660
secret because it can be used to

104
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,180
identify users so here's I'm gonna go

105
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,400
over a greatly simplified example of how

106
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,030
the original AMC caching attack worked

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,039
in GSM so basically phones are always

108
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,809
like constantly scanning looking for a

109
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,969
base station broadcasting at the highest

110
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,650
signal strength and once the phone has

111
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,330
identified a base station as having the

112
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,859
best signal strength it can begin the

113
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,780
process of negotiating a connection to

114
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,300
it one of the first things that happens

115
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,090
when this connection is being set up is

116
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,590
the network requests the phone's MC in

117
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,349
order to verify that the phone

118
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,729
belongs to a paying customer the MC

119
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,550
cashier here pretends to be the

120
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,840
and requests this MC the phone responds

121
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,490
with this MC because it doesn't have a

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,340
way of verifying that it's talking to a

123
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,960
real tower and now the MC catcher has

124
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,438
collected the MC and can move on to the

125
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,020
next one

126
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,819
so notice that the key detail here is

127
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,919
the phone didn't have a way of telling

128
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,509
if it was talking to a real tower or not

129
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,029
it was simply okay with anything that

130
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,810
sort of seemed like a cell tower

131
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,520
broadcasting in the right frequency

132
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,099
range that was sending the right signal

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,960
and Atta and so what can an attacker do

134
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:09,340
with the MC know that they have it well

135
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,419
if it's law enforcement they can use it

136
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,669
to get a warrant to get more information

137
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,198
about you or they can continuously track

138
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,318
what areas you've been in what areas you

139
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:20,469
haven't been in and so on and this

140
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,139
simplified example is also the basis of

141
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:26,080
more severe privacy leaking attacks and

142
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:29,729
gsm LTE and 5g that have been discovered

143
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,229
by security researchers in recent years

144
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,930
so what other types of cell network

145
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,490
attacks build on this one so there's the

146
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,860
often-cited communication interception

147
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,659
attacks from GSM many people worry about

148
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,699
MC catchers being able to intercept

149
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,080
their SMS messages but as far as we know

150
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,150
these types of attacks haven't been

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,159
possible since GSM and they're not as

152
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,779
relevant anymore the way these

153
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,750
communication interception attacks

154
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:55,360
worked is during the simplified MC

155
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,740
catcher attack we just saw the MC

156
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,529
catcher just tells the phone to either

157
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,909
not use encryption or it picked a really

158
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:03,490
weak encryption algorithm that could be

159
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:04,629
broken in real time and that's sort of

160
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,099
the basis of the men in the middle

161
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:08,729
attack it sets up to be able to

162
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:11,050
intercept and decrypt communications

163
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:15,699
also to be clear the ability to

164
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:17,770
intercept smskull smskull oh and the

165
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,969
stack doesn't mean stuff like HTTP or

166
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,680
signal or whatsapp

167
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:22,180
encryption is broken this is a very

168
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,279
common misconception I hear about all

169
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,229
the time the contents of your

170
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,300
communications are safe from MC catchers

171
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:33,610
if you are using what's up signal or

172
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,259
HTTP so onto other attack types so then

173
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,599
there are location tracking attacks

174
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,219
which are the most widely used attack

175
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,438
given how often they are used by

176
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:42,009
commercial MC catchers primarily by law

177
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,589
enforcement

178
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:46,569
so these involve either just collecting

179
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:49,029
MCS like we saw earlier like who's

180
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,500
present in a given geographic area and

181
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:52,300
but then there are also more specific

182
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,289
targeted attacks like being able to

183
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,949
figure out a target six

184
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:58,688
physical location then there are service

185
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,279
denial attacks in which there are

186
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,689
special commands that can be sent to

187
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,849
phones to cause them to stop trying to

188
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:05,529
connect to the network completely or to

189
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,830
completely disable access to specific

190
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:10,599
services and then there are downgrade

191
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,180
attacks where if you set your phone to

192
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,219
primarily use say LTE when available

193
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,589
then it's very easy for an MC catcher to

194
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:18,909
say oh LT isn't available or supported

195
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,159
and your phone it will immediately

196
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:23,020
downgrade and once you've been

197
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:24,969
downgraded to an earlier protocol then

198
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,229
there's like more like types of attacks

199
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,610
then who can be carried out because

200
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:32,949
you're like on an older less secure

201
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,839
version so the main thing that these

202
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:37,330
attacks all have in common is that they

203
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:39,219
rely on phones being willing to talk to

204
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,409
fake base stations masquerading as

205
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:43,209
legitimate cell towers in other words

206
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:45,069
they're only possible because phones

207
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:46,869
can't authenticate towers early on

208
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,189
during the connection procedure and so

209
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:49,539
they have to somewhat blindly trust

210
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:54,399
whoever they're communicating with for a

211
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:56,050
bit and it's no longer just MC Katra

212
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,269
style attacks that are benefiting from

213
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,399
this early stage it's lack of early

214
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:02,199
stage authentication you may have heard

215
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,360
earlier this year that the presidential

216
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,610
alert system is vulnerable to spoofing

217
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,229
attacks basically anyone with some

218
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,059
relatively affordable radio equipment

219
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:14,318
within range send fake emergency alerts

220
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,939
you might remember the chaos from a few

221
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,519
years ago when accidental test

222
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:20,889
presidential alert was sent out in

223
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,529
Hawaii warning of the incoming ballistic

224
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,330
missile and this is the same warning

225
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:31,029
system for which it's very easy to spoof

226
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:34,240
messages so how does this presidential

227
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:36,338
spoofing alerts attack our Chi work so

228
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,698
cell towers are always broadcasting a

229
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:41,919
set of unencrypted messages called

230
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:45,010
system information broadcast messages or

231
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,380
sim for short at set intervals of time

232
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,509
these are the messages that phones read

233
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,250
to get the necessary information needed

234
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:53,319
to connect it to a tower or to get

235
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,420
updates about their connection there are

236
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:59,860
several sips dedicated to emergency

237
00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:02,380
notifications and alerts most notably

238
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,959
sub 10 to 12 which you can see here on

239
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,250
the screen so sip 10 and 11 are

240
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,890
primarily used for

241
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,690
earthquakes and tsunamis and sub 12 is

242
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,610
the one used for presidential threat and

243
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,170
Amber Alerts so I'm gonna skip over a

244
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,540
bunch of details for the sake of time

245
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,400
but basically an attacker just needs to

246
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,589
be able to craft a sip 12 message with

247
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,600
whatever fake emergency text they want

248
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,060
and send it out and nearby phones will

249
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,980
go go off with the emergency alert it's

250
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,619
pretty easy to craft CID messages using

251
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,540
an open source tool like SRS LTE so SRS

252
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,390
LTE is an open source implementation of

253
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,310
the LTE stack and broadcasting use it

254
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,730
using a computer connected to radio

255
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,459
called

256
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:43,710
an SDR s or software-defined radio which

257
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:46,420
costs around $200 for like a decent one

258
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,880
so at this point a question that

259
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,189
commonly comes up is why don't cell

260
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,380
towers just script uber affability sign

261
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,150
their messages or why can't we solve

262
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,060
this problem using digital certificates

263
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,699
like we did with SSL and HTTPS and

264
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,660
that's exactly what the cell network

265
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,200
security research community started

266
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:07,660
asking a few years ago so designing and

267
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,910
implementing like a PKI based digital

268
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,350
certificate system for both for an

269
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,209
arbitrary number of both domestic and

270
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,010
international phones is a hard problem

271
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,130
many of us know from firsthand

272
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,020
experience how hard maintaining PKI is

273
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,820
even when it's internal to just a single

274
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,410
organization and here we're looking for

275
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,150
a solution that scales nationally and

276
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,949
potentially even internationally since

277
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,410
we want to be able to continue to

278
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,540
support like international phone roaming

279
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,880
like they already do so last year some

280
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,530
researchers from Purdue and the

281
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,510
University of Iowa published this paper

282
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,430
titled and secure connection

283
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,439
bootstrapping and cellular networks the

284
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,000
root of all evil which investigates the

285
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,730
first steps towards using digital

286
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
certificates to solve the issue of the

287
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,960
lack of authentication and fill networks

288
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,190
they even built a small working

289
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,620
prototype which they tested out in the

290
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,450
lab so I'm gonna go over some of the

291
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,740
challenges they highlighted with using

292
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,330
digital starts to fix this lack of

293
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,950
authentication and fill networks so the

294
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,080
first thing is it's gonna take a long

295
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,390
time for phones to all be able to

296
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,470
support this newer technology so the

297
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,970
main thing that we have to think about

298
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,500
is maintaining backwards compatibility

299
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,750
when designing and implementing the

300
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,820
system so what does maintaining

301
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,980
backwards compatibility mean and back

302
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,690
according to these researchers well at

303
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,170
the most basic level it means that you

304
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,730
can add fields to existing broadcasting

305
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,949
messages but you can't take over you

306
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,990
can't take any away and you can't also

307
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,120
can't go over the maximum transmission

308
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,460
size which is basically the maximum size

309
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,660
of a radio packet in particular the

310
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,640
researchers pointed out that you can't

311
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,770
fit the entire x.509 certificate chain

312
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,670
and the relevant broadcast messages so

313
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,990
they actually had to come up with a

314
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,589
different encoding scheme and drop some

315
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,780
information backwards compatible to come

316
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,520
bill compatibility also unfortunately

317
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,079
means being able to downgrade to a

318
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,060
protocol that doesn't support this

319
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,520
authentication scheme similar to how

320
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,979
many websites supported both HTTP and

321
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,020
HTTPS before transitioning to HTTPS only

322
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,310
it just means that am scratchers would

323
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,880
still be able to pull off their attacks

324
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:05,949
and this transition period then there's

325
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,390
a question of where is the user going to

326
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,280
store their trusted certs will they go

327
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,710
on the phone the SIM card or somehow a

328
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,150
mix of both users don't easily have

329
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,340
control over what gets written to their

330
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,930
SIM card by network operators I think a

331
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,610
lot of people don't know about this but

332
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,130
there are over-the-air messages that can

333
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,320
be sent to phones to modify the contents

334
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,540
of the SIM card on your phone that

335
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,580
network operator is used in particular

336
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,920
if a network operator decides to comply

337
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,780
with an organisation to say deliver a

338
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,120
malicious cert to a user SIM card from

339
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,829
that organization to be able to man in

340
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,000
the middle of a user's connection then

341
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,000
the user would have no way of knowing

342
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:46,390
then there's the issue of dealing with

343
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:48,310
roaming which is critical to get right

344
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,780
because everyone has to throw to

345
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:52,239
maintain connectivity while traveling

346
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,280
often even when you're only travelling a

347
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,260
very short distance however it's not

348
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,420
possible for a phone or some card to

349
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,130
have every cert it needs installed to

350
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,479
handle all the carriers in my encounter

351
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,330
encounter while roaming

352
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,950
I mean browsers don't really need to do

353
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,600
this either that's why we have sets of

354
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,280
trusted routes and you know like cross

355
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,650
signing and certificate chains and so on

356
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,810
but exactly how this ecosystem would be

357
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,370
set up when it comes to cellular network

358
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,739
carriers is something no one has really

359
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,570
explored in depth yet and then there's

360
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,510
also problems with replay attacks and

361
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,160
certificate revocation so like the

362
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,170
normal techniques like OCSP and

363
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,449
certificate revocation lists don't adopt

364
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,260
nicely to cell networks but the details

365
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,380
of that arm

366
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,780
beyond the scope for this talk so if

367
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,550
you're interested in more details on how

368
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,709
they propose solving this I highly

369
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,209
suggest reading this paper well I don't

370
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,220
necessarily agree with every technical

371
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,330
decision they propose I think it's

372
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,180
honestly one of the best things to

373
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,280
happen in cellular radio security in the

374
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,479
last few years and even though it's

375
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,430
gonna be very difficult to solve this

376
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,140
issue for cell networks I wholeheartedly

377
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,439
believe that we can eventually do it

378
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,939
just like we did with the web so even

379
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,800
though cell network security research is

380
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,270
finally starting to really take off and

381
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,790
people are starting to pay attention to

382
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,170
these issues and propose solutions

383
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:08,670
researchers in this field still face a

384
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:11,380
lot of unique challenges so for example

385
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,729
phone firmware is closed source so

386
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,220
everyone relies on open source

387
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,510
implementations running on STRs to

388
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,370
simulate a phone talking to a network

389
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,689
the kind of radio equipment you need to

390
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,960
do good research is still quite

391
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,540
expensive for example the most basic SDR

392
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,190
or software-defined radio you can buy if

393
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,620
you want to seriously do work in this

394
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:36,010
field is about $400 but then you also

395
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:38,380
need multiple STRs antennas cables

396
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,910
shielding equipment and so on and costs

397
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,980
add up and it becomes very expensive

398
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:46,750
very quickly and so often the legality

399
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,490
of doing research in this field isn't

400
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,920
clear and it tends to vary wildly by

401
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,320
one's location so doing work in this

402
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,880
field often requires broadcasting on

403
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,130
parts of the spectrum which in the

404
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,010
United States are reserved for FCC

405
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:03,040
license devices and your STRs are not

406
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,600
FCC licensed and some parts of the world

407
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,270
you're not even allowed to passively

408
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,430
scan parts of the spectrum reserved for

409
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,650
cellular communications like GSM or LTE

410
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,410
and doing so comes with heavy fines and

411
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,790
potentially even jail time at least one

412
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,459
security researcher was jailed in

413
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:24,099
Tunisia for simply possessing a basic

414
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:26,020
$10 SDR within the last year and then

415
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,880
there's the issue of reading cell

416
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,480
network specs it is extremely difficult

417
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,770
much more difficult than reading rfcs

418
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,660
there are many sprawling documents all

419
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,189
over the place and it's not always clear

420
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,170
how different parts of these systems

421
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,920
interoperate or even what versions are

422
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,920
in use where

423
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,840
when it comes to finding vulnerabilities

424
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,610
in real cell networks every carrier

425
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,590
implements things differently sometimes

426
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,210
even wildly differently a lot of what

427
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,160
ends up in the specs especially when it

428
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,380
comes to security features ends up being

429
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,530
marked as optional for implementation so

430
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,240
you just never know what like a

431
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,240
particular carrier carrier will have

432
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,400
implemented and of course there's also

433
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,830
issues with arrows errors being

434
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,949
introduced in implementation so stepping

435
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:13,770
back a bit earlier I mentioned that the

436
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,380
rate of security research in this field

437
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,819
is investing quite rapidly so here's a

438
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,210
graph that demonstrates how fast

439
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,190
research has been advancing so to break

440
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:25,620
it down so the GSM standards were

441
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,900
drafted in the late 80s and no major

442
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,050
vulnerabilities were publicly released

443
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:33,030
until the first one was found in 2006

444
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,709
and in the next one in 2010 so it took

445
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,800
about ten years from standardization to

446
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:41,160
deployment 4GS for the first gsm

447
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,920
security issues to be found so similarly

448
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,560
the LTE standards were finalized around

449
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,719
2007 and LTE networks started being

450
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,060
deployed around 2011 it only took a few

451
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,610
years after for security researchers to

452
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,949
be able to identify the first public

453
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,780
vulnerabilities in 2015 so only a four

454
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,020
year gap this time as opposed to the 10

455
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:03,630
year gap we saw with GSM so fast forward

456
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,359
to 5g the first draft of the 5g

457
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:09,119
standards were finalized in March 2018

458
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,859
and within 11 months of publication at

459
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,359
least six critical security

460
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,310
vulnerabilities were found by

461
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,139
researchers and this was before there

462
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:19,319
were even any commercial 5g networks

463
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,360
deployed and also more importantly

464
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,399
several studies were recently published

465
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,849
highlighting the fact that 5g protocols

466
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,380
are still vulnerable to the majority of

467
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,939
exploits existing in LTE because the

468
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,770
main root cause namely pre

469
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,500
authentication messages has been carried

470
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,690
over to five chief and just to reiterate

471
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,830
the main reason why security research in

472
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,240
this field has really taken off is

473
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,980
because there's finally good open source

474
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,750
software and somewhat affordable

475
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:47,250
hardware to do this kind of radio

476
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:49,710
security research with so as to when to

477
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,110
expect the core issues and cell network

478
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,610
security to be fixed well I don't know

479
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,199
if you noticed when I originally put

480
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,320
this

481
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,609
earlier but this is a screen shot the

482
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,529
screen shot was a preprint from the

483
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:02,720
mobile sis conference in South Korea and

484
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:05,659
the track it was presented in was titled

485
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,340
waiting for 7g because that's probably

486
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:10,730
how long it's going to take to get some

487
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,009
of these content ocation is fixed right

488
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,749
so in conclusion pre authentication

489
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:17,149
messages are what enable embassy catcher

490
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:19,580
style attacks I'm sorry MC catch your

491
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:21,080
style network attacks emergency alert

492
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,249
spoofing attacks and some other attacks

493
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,730
I didn't have time to cover in this

494
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:27,830
presentation so ask for next steps of

495
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,019
what we can do to like work on making

496
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,139
things better I think more of an effort

497
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:34,879
to make both this field and research in

498
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:36,949
this field more accessible would be

499
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,928
tremendously helpful there are almost no

500
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,429
good publicly accessible educational

501
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,259
resources if you're interested in

502
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,119
learning about this stuff I've even been

503
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:45,830
told stories that if you're hired as an

504
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,379
engineer if you're hired as an engineer

505
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,600
assert and telcos they first put you in

506
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:52,100
full-time classes for the first few

507
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,480
months before you're actually allowed to

508
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,918
start working because that's how steep

509
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,749
the learning curve is I think more

510
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,259
research on appropriate authentication

511
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:04,820
schemes for all networks and more portly

512
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,590
doing it the experimental implementation

513
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,029
work and making sure phones can still

514
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,980
function given all the constraints they

515
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:14,509
have to deal with I would be incredibly

516
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,009
helpful more serious development of open

517
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:18,169
source tools to do work in this field

518
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:19,669
while there are solutions right now that

519
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,859
I talked about before that have been

520
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:24,529
responsible for the explosive growth a

521
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:27,949
research in this field such as SRS LTE

522
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:29,899
for LTE and the open air interface for

523
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,639
5g a lot of them are still quite

524
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:34,158
bare-bones and only support very

525
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:38,238
specific versions of the network

526
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:40,850
protocols another thing that would help

527
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:43,340
is more press calling out cell network

528
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,559
vulnerabilities carriers and the

529
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,149
standard standards orgs have been paying

530
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,190
attention and changing in reaction to

531
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:52,070
all the recent press about cell network

532
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,230
vulnerabilities and finally in addition

533
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,489
to press direct pressure from big tech

534
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,960
companies that have the power to

535
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:58,970
influence the specs is important too

536
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,039
there's been a history of researchers

537
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,570
reporting critical vulnerabilities to

538
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,029
standards orgs and I'm not getting fixed

539
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,330
or even being acknowledged because the

540
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:08,370
attenders orgs don't always

541
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,168
Tai's user privacy and I think that's a

542
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,668
particular area where big tech companies

543
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:15,809
could have some could have some

544
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:17,429
influence yeah anyway that's all I could

545
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:21,139
fit into twenty minutes on this pretty

546
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:21,140
big topic it's time for questions
