00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,240
hi everyone

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,880
i'm pardeez emma biani a postdoctoral

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
scholar at university of washington

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,520
and today i'm going to talk about

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,000
privacy and security nutrition labels

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,119
for smart devices this is a joint effort

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,760
with my phd advisors laurie crainer and

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,119
new raj aggarwal

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,720
at carnegie mellon university

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,520
let me start by talking about toilets

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,320
not regular ones but the smart ones

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,040
we have very expensive smart toilets on

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,239
the market

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
enabled with amazon alexa that could

15
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,800
light up or even better flush for you

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,520
with your voice commands you're also

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,719
going to have a much

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,039
smarter one that is equipped with

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,760
several sensors including cameras

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,239
that could identify you and collect your

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,719
health related information

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,359
this technology could be very useful in

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,320
identifying

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,799
health issues but this could also cause

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,000
a huge risk

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
to users privacy especially if they are

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,240
not aware of the device's practices one

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
scary scenario might be when you infer

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,520
diagnosis

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,759
gets shared with your employer or

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,799
insurance company

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,680
people are increasingly purchasing smart

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,040
devices however

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
despite the surge in purchasing them

35
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
consumers are concerned

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,799
about the privacy and security of the

37
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,079
smart devices they purchase

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,000
and people should be really concerned

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
about these devices

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
after all give some news on how easily

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,799
security cameras are getting hacked but

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,200
sometimes risk would have been mitigated

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,840
if users of these devices were more

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
informed for example

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,399
after ring security cameras got hacked

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,840
the company

47
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,240
emailed their millions of users to use

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,960
multi-factor authentication

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
so maybe these devices would have not

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,479
been easily hacked

51
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,439
if the users knew about better and more

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,360
secure authentication mechanisms

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,680
you may have also heard about google

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
putting its consumer's address

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
by forgetting to mention that it's not

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,319
secured up by the microphone

57
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,760
or in other words failing to inform

58
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,680
consumers about the device sensors

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,760
another example showing how currently

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
manufacturers are not transparent about

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,040
their privacy and security practices

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
is then some smart tvs are sending out

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,360
data to third parties without disclosing

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,840
it

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,959
or then it got to reveal that amazon is

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
sharing unencrypted recordings of users

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,160
voices

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,680
with its employees therefore

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,760
in many data collection scenarios

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
consumers are not informed about who

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
their data is being shared with or

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
solved

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
it is important to mention that our

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,239
primary focus in all these examples

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,080
was not the specific privacy and

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
security practice

77
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,400
of the smart device or the manufacturer

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,480
the problem that they focused on

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,360
and proposed a solution for was the lack

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,519
of information users have

81
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,560
about the practices of these devices

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,040
to inform consumers we looked for an

83
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
effective way to present them with

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,400
devices privacy and security information

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,799
we designed a privacy and security label

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,080
for smart devices

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,159
somewhat similar to nutrition labels for

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,280
foods

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
what you see here is the most recent

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,959
version of our label

91
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,599
but we did not start from here in this

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,319
talk

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,319
i will walk you through the journey of

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,200
this label how it got born how it spends

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
teenage years

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
and when it's finally matured our design

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
label covers various privacy and

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680
security attributes related to the smart

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,640
device

100
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
including types of access control sensor

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,280
type and who the data is being shared

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
with and sold to

103
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,519
i will first talk about the initial

104
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,959
version of our label

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
that we designed based on the studies we

106
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,280
conducted with crowdsourced participants

107
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,760
to specify the privacy information that

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,599
people are concerned about related to

109
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,320
iot data collection scenarios

110
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,079
i will then discuss the study they

111
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,560
conducted with consumers of iot devices

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
to capture their feedback on the initial

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,080
label

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,240
being convinced about the essence of

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,800
having the labels for consumers

116
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,120
we then interviewed and surveyed several

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
privacy and security experts

118
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
to identify the most important

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,479
information

120
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,120
that we should include on the labels

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,400
with this information

122
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,120
we design the next version of the label

123
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,080
finally

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
i will discuss how we improve the

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
usability and effectiveness of our label

126
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
by conducting studies with consumers of

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,960
smart devices

128
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,280
literature has identified several

129
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,080
factors

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
that could potentially impact people's

131
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
privacy professional concerns

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,039
related to iot data collection scenarios

133
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,520
prior work has only covered a very

134
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,160
specific

135
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
subset of iot data collection scenarios

136
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,919
in addition

137
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,400
all the prior research has looked into

138
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,199
each piece of information individually

139
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,199
and did not consider the potential

140
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,400
significance

141
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,479
of presenting the combination of the

142
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,440
factors

143
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,160
we designed a large scale online study

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
to cover several data collection

145
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,880
scenarios

146
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,039
and measure nuances in users privacy

147
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,199
preferences and expectations by looking

148
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,320
into the combination of various factors

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,560
some of the factors be included in our

150
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,120
study where type of collected data

151
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
location of data collection and for how

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
long the collected data is being

153
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
retained

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,120
for each factor we tested several levels

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,160
for example

156
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
for the type of collected data we tested

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
levels including media

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
audio and biometrics for location

159
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,840
we had library home and public restroom

160
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,000
and for the retention time we tested

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
retention up to a year

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,120
forever or unspecified

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
we built statistical models to explain

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
participants concerns and preferences

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
toward various data collection scenarios

166
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,919
that degenerated by combining the

167
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,280
privacy factors

168
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,240
that i just mentioned our qualitative

169
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
and quantitative analysis

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
indicated that data type location of

171
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
data collection and retention time

172
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,600
were among the factors that participants

173
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,919
were significantly concerned about

174
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,680
and that they reported that they would

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
like to be notified about this

176
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,479
information

177
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,800
then engaging with such data collections

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
most importantly we found that privacy

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
concerns are diverse and context

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,960
dependent

181
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
meaning that no individual piece of

182
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,800
information about the data collection

183
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,919
scenario

184
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,000
has the power to accurately predict

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
people's level of comfort and concern

186
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,800
with that data collection indeed it is

187
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,639
the context of data collection

188
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,639
that is built around the combination of

189
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,000
the factors

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
that can best explain people's privacy

191
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919
preferences and concerns

192
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,360
to avoid data collections in other words

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,000
to help people make informed decisions

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
about data collections

195
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
we need to show this information

196
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
holistically

197
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
instead of focusing on a specific

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,520
privacy factor

199
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,800
by introducing a new factor of social

200
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,199
influence we then explored how social

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:33,840
cues from

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,639
other people impact iot related privacy

203
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
decision making

204
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,319
although social influence has not been

205
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,840
studied in the context of iot and

206
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,800
privacy prior work

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
has shown that various factors could

208
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,479
change the extent of the social

209
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,120
influence

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,080
factors such as the level of expertise

211
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,720
level of agreement among the influencers

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,400
and the extent to which people agree

213
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,319
with the influencers

214
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,160
to measure the importance of the level

215
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,560
of expertise we consider two types of

216
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,759
influencers friends and experts

217
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
we tested two levels of consensus strong

218
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,080
and weak we also tested two types of

219
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
social cues

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,280
cues which were consistent with

221
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,680
participants opinion and perception

222
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,319
and the values which were inconsistent

223
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,520
with these three

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,919
factors we design our experimental

225
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,520
conditions

226
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,160
conducted a large scale online study and

227
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,560
presented several hypothetical scenarios

228
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,320
to participants

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,039
in each scenario we described an iot

230
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,399
data collection

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,719
in this study we were interested in

232
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,958
exploring the impact of social influence

233
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,519
on participants privacy decision making

234
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
to achieve this in the experimental

235
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
conditions at the end of each scenario

236
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
they provided a social cue for example

237
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,360
we said

238
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
more than 85 percent of privacy experts

239
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
allowed this data collection they did

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,720
not show any social cues

241
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,200
in the control condition participants

242
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,360
decision making task was to specify

243
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
whether they would allow or deny the

244
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
described data collection

245
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,519
similar to the previous study we built

246
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,120
statistical models

247
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,600
to specify the significance of social

248
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,480
influence

249
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,959
in participants decision making our

250
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,839
analysis

251
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,320
showed that decisions toward allowing or

252
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
denying iot data collections

253
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,040
could be significantly influenced by

254
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,680
privacy

255
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,640
experts and friends we found that the

256
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
extent of this influence depends on

257
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,600
various factors

258
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,839
including how consistent the social cues

259
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,000
are with participants opinions

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,680
and the strength of social cues

261
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,080
relying on the findings of the two

262
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,839
studies i mentioned so far

263
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
we designed the first prototype of our

264
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
privacy and security label for iot

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
devices as shown here

266
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
we included three sections on the label

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,160
general information privacy information

268
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
and security information

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,880
to give you a few examples of how we

270
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,360
translated the findings of our studies

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
to design this label let's take a closer

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
look

273
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,040
in the first study we found that factors

274
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,320
such as data type

275
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
retention type and data sharing

276
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,800
significantly influenced participants

277
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
decisions to allow

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,800
or deny the data collection therefore we

279
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,279
included these factors on the label

280
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,839
and from the second study we found that

281
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,120
the social cues

282
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
from experts significantly impact

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,839
participants privacy decisions

284
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,399
therefore based on that on the label

285
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
that included a story from an

286
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,320
independent privacy institute

287
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,399
in the studies i mentioned so far we

288
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,640
focused on privacy factors

289
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
and did not include the security

290
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,839
attributes

291
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,720
we populated the security section of the

292
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,000
initial label

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,920
by collecting a few relevant and

294
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
important security factors

295
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
from several iot standards and

296
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,760
guidelines such as the uk code of

297
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,399
practice for consumer iot security

298
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,680
and digital standard to understand how

299
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,320
consumers are currently purchasing smart

300
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,200
devices

301
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,279
and to capture their perceptions of our

302
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,640
designed label

303
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,519
we conducted a study with iot consumers

304
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
which i will describe next

305
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
from the literature we already know

306
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
various factors

307
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,399
that could potentially influence

308
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,320
consumers purchase behavior

309
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,040
some of these factors are price brand

310
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,920
features

311
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,600
quality and reviews they focus on all ut

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,160
related purchase behavior and conducted

313
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,560
an interview study with 24 consumers

314
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,839
who had purchased at least one smart

315
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,240
device

316
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,880
almost all of our interviews reported

317
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,640
that they would like to know about their

318
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,800
privacy and secure the information on

319
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
smart devices

320
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,959
before purchasing them they also ask

321
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,360
them

322
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
how much of a premium they are willing

323
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,600
to pay if any to have this information

324
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,399
available

325
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,279
at the time of purchase almost all

326
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,959
mentioned that they are willing to pay

327
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,680
10 to 30 percent of the base price of

328
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,720
the device

329
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,200
to be provided with this transparency

330
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
mostly because of the person's assurance

331
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,959
that their privacy and security would be

332
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:13,920
protected

333
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,279
and also for peace of mind

334
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,600
as part of our interview study he asked

335
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,760
participants what factors they would

336
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
care about when purchasing a smart

337
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,720
device

338
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,639
but about half of the interviews brought

339
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,720
up privacy and security before we

340
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,079
mentioned them

341
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,399
the other half did not discuss privacy

342
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,760
or security

343
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
until we specifically asked them about

344
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,000
how much they value privacy and security

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,320
information before making a purchase

346
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,440
however

347
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,320
once prompted almost all interviews

348
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
reported

349
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,200
being concerned about the privacy and

350
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,680
security of your iot devices

351
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,560
mainly due to media reports opinions

352
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,079
shared by their friends

353
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,639
or observing unexpected device behavior

354
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,519
for example

355
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,839
when alexa is laughing out of nowhere as

356
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,600
a participant mentioned

357
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,720
this suggests that for some consumers

358
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,680
privacy and security are latent concerns

359
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,279
which could be serviced readily

360
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,920
if privacy and security information is

361
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,279
made salient

362
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,560
for example by appearing on a label most

363
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
consumers are prompted to consider

364
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,680
privacy and security

365
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,639
information they may incorporate it into

366
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,279
their purchase decision process

367
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
from this study we found that it is

368
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,440
currently very difficult for consumers

369
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
of iut devices

370
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
to find information about the privacy

371
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,279
and security of smart devices at the

372
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,880
time of purchase

373
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,199
and that they are very excited about the

374
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,000
idea

375
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,560
of having privacy and security labels at

376
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,518
the point of sale

377
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,399
there are several legislations both

378
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,800
inside the u.s such as the cyber shield

379
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,519
act

380
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,480
and outside of the u.s including the uk

381
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
singapore and finland

382
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,279
that advocate for having such labels and

383
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,440
some people mention a few factors

384
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
that should be included on these labels

385
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,320
but there is no specific rationale

386
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,079
as to why some information should be

387
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,000
included on the label or

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
how this information should be presented

389
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,199
on the label

390
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,680
and as you can see from the headlines

391
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,040
these proposals

392
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,760
are primarily focused on security

393
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,639
attributes

394
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,480
without much attention to privacy

395
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,800
practices

396
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,839
so our question here was what should be

397
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,240
included at an iot privacy and security

398
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,560
label

399
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,519
to capture a holistic view we invited a

400
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,639
diverse sample of

401
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,440
experts from industry academia

402
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
government and ngos

403
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
and to elicit their opinions on the

404
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,079
privacy and security

405
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
factors may conduct several interviews

406
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,399
and surveys

407
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,959
experts acknowledge the value of the

408
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,760
label

409
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,600
in informing consumers purchased

410
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,480
behavior an expert mentioned

411
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
what's good about the label is that it

412
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
empowers the consumer to make a more

413
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,279
active decision about cyber security

414
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,959
rather than just being completely

415
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,120
helpless as to what the security

416
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,959
offering device might be

417
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,320
someone's gonna be looking out for

418
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
consumers and giving the consumers this

419
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
information

420
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,079
experts wanted us to include 47

421
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,079
privacy and security attributes on the

422
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,680
label which is

423
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,639
clearly too many to put on a typical

424
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,079
product package

425
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,800
therefore we decided to design a layered

426
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,320
label with two layers

427
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,800
the primary layer is the concise format

428
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,680
of the label

429
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,199
which could be printed and attached to

430
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,959
the package of the product

431
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,360
and then there is a qr code and url at

432
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,320
the bottom

433
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,480
that direct consumers the secondary

434
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
layer which has

435
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,399
more detailed information and is in an

436
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,480
online only format

437
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
online format means that it can be

438
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
updated as the firmware changes

439
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,279
which is critical as devices get updated

440
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,160
often

441
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,240
another important reason to have this

442
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,320
online layer is to have a way

443
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,040
to accommodate companies updating their

444
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,639
privacy and security practices

445
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,519
to assess our labels usability and

446
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,360
information communication

447
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,000
we recruited iot consumers and conducted

448
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
an interview with each participant

449
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,800
we tested the labels used communication

450
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,959
and information comprehension

451
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,079
in both non-comparative and comparative

452
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,440
purchase process

453
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
we started with the non-comparative

454
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,680
process and asked our participants

455
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
to take a look at the package of the

456
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,880
smart device

457
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,279
with our label on and define the

458
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,079
attributes

459
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,560
as well as their values we then ask them

460
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,800
to specify the information that conveys

461
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,320
risk to them

462
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,720
in a comparative scenario participants

463
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
imagine doing comparison shopping

464
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
for a smart device from two different

465
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,560
companies

466
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,880
we asked them to compare the labels and

467
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,680
specify

468
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,399
which company had implemented better

469
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,240
privacy and security practices

470
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,800
and why as we expected

471
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,880
some of the information on the secondary

472
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,959
layer wasn't understandable

473
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
to a few consumer participants for

474
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,240
example

475
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,359
devices for some protocols however

476
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,679
most participants reported that they

477
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,919
would still like to see this information

478
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,720
on the second

479
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,919
layer to be as informed as possible when

480
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,679
purchasing a smart device

481
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,480
one of our participants said i don't

482
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
know what tcp and udp are

483
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,720
but it's interesting to have this here

484
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,400
because then i could go to reddit

485
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
and ask on there what that means and

486
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
what the capabilities are

487
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,160
some of our consumer participants

488
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,720
reported that our label is useful

489
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,080
to inform both consumers and experts a

490
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
participant mentioned

491
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
labels are both for customers and

492
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,240
experts such as tech journalists and

493
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,320
consumer advocacy groups

494
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,840
if they see something that is

495
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
questionable they'll be raised in the

496
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,799
public press or

497
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,360
they erase it the regulatory authorities

498
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,840
the label is not just for the consumer

499
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,160
but there's another feedback process

500
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,200
that works through

501
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,520
experts based on participants feedback

502
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,919
we applied further changes the content

503
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,679
and design of our labels

504
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,080
and this is the most recent version of

505
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,559
our label

506
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,280
to recap smart devices are not

507
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
transparent about their privacy and

508
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,039
security practices and the label

509
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,360
could be useful to provide that much in

510
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,559
the transparency and

511
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,440
for consumers purchase behavior in this

512
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
presentation

513
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,039
i discussed several consumer and expert

514
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,960
studies that they conducted

515
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
to design a usable and informative label

516
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,360
but we are not done here in order to

517
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,320
make a difference

518
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,640
in participants purchase behavior we

519
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,440
need you to take

520
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,679
action if you are an iot manufacturer

521
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
you can be the first adopted label for

522
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
your products

523
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,760
to help you in the process we developed

524
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,640
a tool

525
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,120
that you can use to generate the labels

526
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,919
you can also

527
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
help us test the labels in realistic

528
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,280
purchase settings

529
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
by participating in a pilot deployment

530
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,880
of the label

531
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,559
on your products if you are a policy

532
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,440
maker

533
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
you can push this effort but out by

534
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,640
advocating for it in the regulations

535
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,039
governments of countries such as uk

536
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,720
finland and singapore

537
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,360
are already encouraging manufacturers to

538
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,000
have the iot label on their products

539
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
even in the us we have policy reports

540
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,520
vaguely

541
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
mentioning the importance of iot privacy

542
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,360
and security labels

543
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,240
but such reports cannot be effective

544
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,960
without being

545
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,760
specific we prepared an extensive

546
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,200
taxonomy document

547
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,919
for our label which could be helpful in

548
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,760
specifying the information that

549
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
manufacturers should disclose on the

550
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,280
label

551
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
finally if you are a consumer of iot

552
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,720
devices

553
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,480
you can put the pressure on the

554
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,840
manufacturers

555
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
by purchasing from those who are

556
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,679
continuously transparent

557
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,200
about their privacy and security

558
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
practices and demand those who are not

559
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,480
to provide you with information about

560
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
their practices

561
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,720
our labels are not fighting against the

562
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,520
manufacturers or the technology

563
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,000
we design the labels to advocate for

564
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,679
responsible technology

565
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,440
which you believe could benefit the

566
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,480
society as whole

567
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,640
if you want to know more about the most

568
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,400
recent version of our label

569
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
or use the tools to generate the label i

570
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,000
encourage you to

571
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,440
visit iot securityprivacy.org and if you

572
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,520
are interested in knowing more about how

573
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
you can be a part of this effort
