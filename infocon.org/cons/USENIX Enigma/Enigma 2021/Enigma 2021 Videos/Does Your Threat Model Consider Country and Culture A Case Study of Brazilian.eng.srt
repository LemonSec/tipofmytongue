1
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,080
i'm a brazilian

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,360
i'm also our analyst thus i learned more

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,559
and else in brazil

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
with brazilian our samples what's

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,560
interesting about that

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
is that the outcomes i got used to have

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,320
from my analysis were often very

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
different than what's reported in the

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,880
global literature

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,359
and i've always wondered why was i doing

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,960
anything wrong

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,119
but the reason is that attacks are very

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,960
tied to the country and future of the

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,239
attack and population

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,559
and we often do not realize that and

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,440
thus we misread defensive opportunities

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,520
i'll show you why we got used to news

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,480
like this

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,640
that generalized everything as a global

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,039
trend

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,280
thus companies invest billions to

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,440
protect their customers against these

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,399
reported trends and threats

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,559
but in the other side of the world

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,559
distinct trends might be taking place

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,959
if we had paid attention to that we

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,560
might have predicted

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,720
some of the attackers movement migrating

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,960
from one place to another

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
so have you ever considered that the

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,439
emergence of a new mower attack

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,680
might be related to the country and

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,560
future of the attacking population

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,799
do you know what happened outside in the

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,600
world

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
in countries that are not covered in

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,000
their homogeneous threat reports

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
if you answered no come with me in a

39
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
journey through the brazilian banking

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
system

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,439
the brazilian banking system has

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,360
undergone through many modifications and

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
evolutions over time

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,560
that covers from the early

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,479
computerization to the adoption of

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,320
mobile devices

47
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,399
and thus i will consider this as a

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,520
temporal guide

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,479
from our journey

50
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,119
the first attempts to computerize the

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
brazilian banking system dates back to

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,079
the 80s

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,680
by that time the brazilian bank

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
ecosystem was already as computerized as

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,320
the u.s one

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,159
the reason for that is that the

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,079
brazilians suffered from a period of

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,280
very high inflation

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,199
so people could not keep up with the

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,479
daily price changes

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,720
so they decided to mitigate this problem

62
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,560
by computerizing everything

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
so they would migrate the banks from the

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
physical to the digital world

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,040
they deployed applications to be

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,360
installed in the user's desktop machine

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
so they could interact

68
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,680
with the bank via internet what's the

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
problem with that

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,000
the problem is that attackers migrated

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,840
from the physical to the digital world

72
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,400
as well

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,120
as you can see here they deployed fake

74
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,239
banking application

75
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,239
trying to impersonate the legitimate

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,280
bank you want

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
so as to deceive users and to provide

78
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
their credentials for the attackers

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
notes i'm here talking about

80
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,760
applications not pages

81
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,000
this was way before the adoption of web

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
banking

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
and here is the first example of a

84
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
cultural

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,440
related attack because this attack

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
only succeeded because the brazilian

87
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,720
banks indeed

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,120
have a legitimate banking application

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,319
that resembles

90
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,480
this fake one this kind of attack would

91
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
not make sense

92
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
elsewhere at that time and in fact

93
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
the antivirus of that time the global

94
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,879
security solutions

95
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,800
were not very good at detecting this

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,920
kind of threat

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,120
because these samples did not have

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
mixed and affected a lot of the system

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,440
the effect in the sense of

100
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
exploiting any vulnerability escalating

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,640
privilege or

102
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,879
dropping some other payload the only

103
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,239
action they were doing

104
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,720
that system was deceiving users into

105
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
providing their credentials

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,720
so what's being exploited here in the

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,680
last instance

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,159
is not a technological issue or not only

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,680
a technological issue

110
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,920
but the human inability to distinguish

111
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,840
between a legitimate and a fake

112
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
application

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,560
and why does it matter because

114
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
decades later after the emergence of

115
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,879
this kind of threat in brazil

116
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,000
we are still falling to the same attacks

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
because but now just in a new

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,680
technological fashion

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,360
now we have kind of sms like this

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
that presents you a link that redirects

121
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,439
you to a fake

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,720
page or a fake applications so although

123
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,440
it was

124
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,079
it emerged the first time in brazil many

125
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
years ago or at least become widespread

126
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,199
first in brazil many years ago we are

127
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,600
still

128
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,840
falling to the same kind of attack

129
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,720
because

130
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
in the instance again is not only a

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
technological issue that being exploited

132
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
but this human

133
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
inability to distinguish between a

134
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,199
legitimate

135
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
and a fake application or page or

136
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
whatever and well people might say

137
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
okay but this happens everywhere in the

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,400
world so

139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
let's be a bit more specific about

140
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
brazil

141
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
so this is a political this is a

142
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
brazilian payment method

143
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,240
as far as i know it only exists in

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
brazil

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
and here's another example of a threat

146
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
and derived threats

147
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,240
that could originate in brazil and then

148
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,639
spread all around the world

149
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
but why do a baleto even exist and the

150
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,880
reason is that

151
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,039
although the banks were computerized by

152
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,560
that time the population was not

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,479
so they have to create a way to

154
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,639
intermediate transactions between the

155
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,440
online

156
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
people that includes the bank and some

157
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,199
customer and the offline

158
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,880
population that were the people that do

159
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,440
not have access to the internet or to a

160
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,160
computer

161
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,840
so they created this kind of

162
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,440
intermediate uh

163
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,840
transaction method so anyone with access

164
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,280
to a computerized system

165
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
could print a baleto and provide to an

166
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,320
offline people

167
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,000
and offline people could in the last

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
things to make it back

169
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,520
to the digital world by scanning the

170
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
barcode

171
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,280
so in this scenario you may say okay so

172
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,479
offline people

173
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,039
are safe they are free from our they are

174
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,680
free from

175
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,759
be affected by electronic threats right

176
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,240
and of course not because what happened

177
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
in the end is that

178
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,160
attackers created the boletos malware a

179
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,280
kind of malware

180
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,919
that infected the system and then hook

181
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,160
into the printing subsystem

182
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,720
to print a fake bullet afraid a fake

183
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
barcode

184
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
so the unaffected people would be

185
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
printing a volatile

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,319
believing that it is a real bullet or

187
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,199
that it's

188
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
displaying the correct payment method

189
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,680
the correct agency and account number

190
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
and so on

191
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
but in fact it's printing a distinct

192
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,960
code that points to an attacker

193
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,520
banking account and then you to be

194
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
delivered to the offline people

195
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,319
that you then pay this boleto to an

196
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:40,960
attacker

197
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
instead of the legitimate owner of the

198
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,600
boleto

199
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,639
so here i ask does your threat model

200
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,759
include offline people probably not

201
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
but okay some might say i'm talking

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,039
about old stuff

203
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,039
so let's talk about what happened when

204
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,960
banks moved to the web

205
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
when banks adopted web pages and

206
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,800
internet banking as you probably know

207
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,280
due to a partnership with some banks

208
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
computer security incident response

209
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:11,919
teams

210
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,840
i have been for the last 80 years

211
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,080
working on a data set of more than four

212
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,280
thousand unique

213
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,120
mars sample collected by the banks in

214
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,639
their customers machines

215
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,400
they are real mower samples that

216
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,120
succeeded on infecting rio customers

217
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,919
machines and among all discovers that

218
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,720
can be made

219
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,919
about this data set what grabs

220
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:32,720
immediately

221
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
everybody's attention at first glance is

222
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
the diversity of file formats

223
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,599
used in these attacks whereas the global

224
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,400
literature

225
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
states that p files are prevalent

226
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
everywhere in the world e files that are

227
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
part of executable the typical

228
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,680
file format used by windows executable

229
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,759
uh these are not prevailed in brazil as

230
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,879
you can see here they have

231
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,560
their usage that has been decreasing

232
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,319
over time and the latest

233
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,639
year javascript is now the prevalent

234
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,000
file format used

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,800
by the attackers and since the beginning

236
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,199
in each

237
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,280
year you have a new trend of a distinct

238
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,720
file format

239
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,039
being used by attackers from the

240
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,680
adoption of cpl files control panel

241
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,560
outlets

242
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,039
to multi-platform malware written in

243
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,000
dot-net

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,599
so what explains this diversity in file

245
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,560
format

246
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
what explains attackers shifting from

247
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,479
one file format to another

248
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
in a so short period of time what

249
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,039
explains for instance the emergence of

250
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,400
java based malware

251
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,120
maurita and java there must be something

252
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
beyond the technical aspects

253
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
maybe cultural regional or economical

254
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,919
aspects

255
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
that explains such migration from one

256
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
format to another

257
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,399
and in fact in the case of brazil what

258
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
shapes the way that the maori are

259
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,120
delivered

260
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,800
is the defenses themselves that are

261
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,320
employed by the banks

262
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
because the banks are aware that there

263
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,320
are malware out there

264
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,839
trying to infect their customers

265
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,440
machines and to perform

266
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
fraud against them so what banks decide

267
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
to do to react and to fight this

268
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,600
kind of attack this kind of mower was to

269
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,320
require

270
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
everybody every customer to install a

271
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
secured plugin

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,959
so it's mandatory for all customers that

273
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,800
wants to access internet bank of

274
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,240
all major banks in brazil this plugin

275
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,480
acts as an anti-virus that is installed

276
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
in your browser it searches your

277
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
computer

278
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,600
in search of for malware and any kind of

279
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,760
mower especially banking mower

280
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,440
trying to prevent you from being

281
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,000
infected and are proud to be concluded

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,440
successfully

283
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,839
and what's the problem here the problem

284
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,640
is that

285
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,839
this plugin is written in java so

286
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,880
since the adoption of this plugin to the

287
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,760
present

288
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,720
attackers can simply assume that java is

289
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,839
installed

290
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,160
in everybody's every internet bank

291
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,760
customer machine so there's a big

292
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,800
population

293
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
of java powered machines out there so

294
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,640
they can now

295
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,760
simply distribute java written malware

296
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,480
that are less detected by antivirus than

297
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
their binary counterparts

298
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
so what the brazilian scenario teaches

299
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,240
here

300
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
is that the way that we develop our

301
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,440
defense

302
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
also shapes the way that our taxes will

303
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,040
be performed in the future

304
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,920
the way that we develop our defense also

305
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,839
shape that the way that the attackers

306
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,040
reacted to that and how can i be sure

307
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,880
that there are the same attackers that

308
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
are migrating from one format

309
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,600
to the other well that's because i have

310
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
been tracking some of these

311
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
attackers over time here show for

312
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,640
instance an example of a

313
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,200
semi-attacking group that's responsible

314
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
for more than 400 unique samples

315
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,120
over a period of like seven years

316
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
and what we find here is that in fact

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
what they are doing is migrating from

318
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
one file format to another

319
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,079
we can see here they are migrating for

320
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,120
instance from dll files to cpl files

321
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
they are changing the way that they are

322
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,839
packaged so the packing solution change

323
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,959
changes their prevalence from one year

324
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,320
to another but in the end what is common

325
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,720
among

326
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,200
all versions of the the mower samples

327
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
created by these criminals

328
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,680
is that they are all password stealers

329
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
so what we need to do is to change the

330
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,880
incentives

331
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,040
for the excesses of the password

332
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,640
stealing attempt

333
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,519
instead of trying to pursue the each

334
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,600
file forms that are being released over

335
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,240
time

336
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,079
so there's no por there's no problem for

337
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,160
the attackers to migrate from one file

338
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,800
format

339
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
to another as you can see here that what

340
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,959
they are doing practice

341
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,279
since their goal is successful and their

342
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,399
goal is to

343
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
steal passwords so we need to change the

344
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,399
incentives for that

345
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,519
more than changing any technological uh

346
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,399
issue any technology behind the creation

347
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,519
and deployment

348
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,600
of these uh malware attacks

349
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
so leaving the past behind let's not

350
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,279
talk about the present

351
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
the age of mobile banking and mobile

352
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
devices

353
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,560
when finally all the secured promises

354
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,399
become true right

355
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,000
well unfortunately not i mean the

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,600
security nowadays is indeed

357
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
much better than it was in the past but

358
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,240
there is still lots of restriction

359
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,360
especially economical constraints for

360
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
instance for the case of brazil

361
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,680
most part of the population was only

362
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,360
computerized recently

363
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,240
or adding the age of mobile devices so

364
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
they skipped the process of

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,240
learning security via those previous

366
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,880
incidents that i have presented

367
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,600
moreover adopting mobile banking brings

368
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,959
new security challenges

369
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,399
that are represented more details

370
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,600
in brazil unlimited mobile data plans

371
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,120
are very expensive

372
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
and by very expensive i mean very

373
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
expensive

374
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,040
so the most popular plans are all

375
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,600
limited the among all likely the most

376
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,760
popular is the whatsapp free plan

377
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,720
whatsapp is for free and nothing else no

378
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
internet banking

379
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
so to operate in this scenario of

380
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,760
limited plans

381
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,240
what banks did was to adopt whatsapp

382
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
based transactions since everybody was

383
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
using whatsapp via those free plans

384
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,120
as you can see here in the figures the

385
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,399
banks developed

386
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,880
chat bots to operate in whatsapp so you

387
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,959
can send a message to a chat bot

388
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,639
and the chat bot will perform the

389
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,240
banking transaction for you

390
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
you can even transfer money from one

391
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,440
account to another

392
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
sending a message to one of those bank

393
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,440
chat bots

394
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,200
but there's a problem here and a

395
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
security problem

396
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,560
by outsourcing your operation from your

397
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,120
own app

398
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,440
to a 30 party app you are also

399
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
outsourcing the security of your

400
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,519
operation to a third party

401
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,240
so if the threat model of your operation

402
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,560
and

403
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,199
of the 30 party app is very different

404
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,120
you might have problem

405
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
be more clearly when you are developing

406
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,480
your own app

407
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,639
you can control all permissions that are

408
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,320
requested by the app

409
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,680
if you are a banking app you can

410
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
restrict for instance accessibility

411
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,720
services

412
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,360
which prevent an attacker from deploying

413
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,639
a fakie keyboard

414
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,680
to key logger what the user is typing on

415
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,120
your application

416
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,199
but if you are using us you are

417
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,800
deploying your service on top of

418
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,560
whatsapp for instance you are adopting

419
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,839
whatsapp threat model

420
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,839
that is completely different from a bank

421
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,040
threat model

422
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
and whatsapp does not restrict any

423
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
accessibility services

424
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,680
any malicious actor can deploy and

425
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,160
distribute a malicious accessibility

426
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,880
service for instant malicious keyboard

427
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,360
that type something on behalf of you on

428
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,480
whatsapp

429
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,639
and this fake application this fake

430
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,079
accessibility service

431
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,000
might for instance perform a transaction

432
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,160
for you in one of those

433
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
uh chat bots that's exactly what's

434
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,760
happening right now

435
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,120
uh in brazil so here's a good point to

436
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,079
ask you

437
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,160
does your threat model consider what's

438
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,600
up

439
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,000
does her threat model consider bank

440
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,880
operations

441
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,240
over whatsapp or even does your threat

442
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,000
model consider

443
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,399
users with limited data plans

444
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,519
well so far i have presented

445
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,040
how the historical cultural social and

446
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,560
economical aspects

447
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,279
shapes attacks and defenses in many

448
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,040
distinct scenarios

449
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,839
but one might still ask okay but

450
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,240
technologically and technically

451
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,720
is the brazilian mower really different

452
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,279
and i approve that

453
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
he represented the difference on the

454
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,040
malicious behaviors exhibited by the

455
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,320
brazilian power samples

456
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,399
collected by our banking partner and the

457
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,160
u.s and japanese samples

458
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,639
collected by a partner secured company

459
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,560
and it's quite clear that the samples

460
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,839
are very different

461
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,839
for instance brazilian samples were the

462
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,880
ones that most interacted via network

463
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,440
because since they are password stealers

464
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,000
their stolen data need to be exfiltrated

465
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,920
via the network to their command and

466
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
control servers

467
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,680
on the other hand us samples were the

468
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,120
ones that most

469
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,079
mostly exhibited interaction with the

470
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,040
file system

471
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
because since i present in the beginning

472
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,399
of this presentation

473
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,560
ransomware was trending there by that

474
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
time a trend that never happened in

475
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,360
brazil

476
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
so it's quite clear that the samples are

477
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,680
very different according to location

478
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,040
so it's time to stop writing our reports

479
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,759
that do not fully and clearly state

480
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,639
which time of

481
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
period of time is considered which

482
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,399
population and which country is

483
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,160
represented by those malware samples

484
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,000
and this difference in them our samples

485
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,440
from one place to another help

486
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,639
explaining the results i was talking

487
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,759
about in the beginning of my

488
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,600
presentation why my results

489
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,480
were often different because most of the

490
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,120
promised

491
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,920
99 percent accuracy or detection rate of

492
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,360
most solutions

493
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,440
is only achieved when considered a fully

494
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
balanced data set

495
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,959
but in reality things are not balanced

496
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,320
as you can see here

497
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,799
this is what we observed by looking to

498
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,000
the prevalence of

499
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,480
our family in the customers machines so

500
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
they are much more targeted by some our

501
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
families than by the others

502
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,439
according to the bias of each region so

503
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,599
isn't it time to start thinking about

504
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,720
the development of

505
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,199
solutions for unbalanced data set

506
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,919
and talking about the detection solution

507
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,480
look what happens when considered

508
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,520
anti-virus detection of the so-called

509
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,000
global

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,240
samples and the reported brazilian

511
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,120
samples

512
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,320
we noticed that for both binaries

513
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,720
and web pages the brazilian samples are

514
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,600
consistently

515
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
less detect than the so-called global

516
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,720
samples

517
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,960
which indicates that the security

518
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,760
companies

519
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,080
are missing something are missing some

520
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
aspect of the cultural and local

521
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,280
mower samples when training their models

522
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,520
i'm talking about training a model look

523
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
what happens when we try to train a

524
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,960
machine learning model to detect

525
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,520
those brazilian samples do you remember

526
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,720
when i presented that

527
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
brazilian attackers were often changed

528
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
the distributed file format from one

529
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,240
year to another

530
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
so what happens when try to train the

531
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
machine learning classifiers

532
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
considering those brazilian mower

533
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,240
samples is that the classifier tends to

534
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,960
drift

535
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,039
as shown here by those high bars in the

536
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,840
figure so from time to time the concept

537
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,440
learned by the classifier

538
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,600
is not meaningful anymore because the

539
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,320
distributed mouse sample changed so much

540
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,880
that they are not representative of what

541
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
the our classifier learned

542
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,799
and as you can see here the cluster

543
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,559
formed by the mowers from

544
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,280
period to period is often very different

545
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,919
so

546
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,880
we should stop developing a dock machine

547
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,760
learning models

548
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,160
and we start considering concept drift

549
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
detectors in the model because in

550
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,880
reality

551
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,840
what happens is that malware revolves so

552
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
fast that we need

553
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,559
to update frequently what we consider as

554
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
a malware

555
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,720
but well now we know what is happening

556
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
out there now we know some of this

557
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,039
problem

558
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,840
what to do

559
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
first of all we need to understand and

560
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,880
acknowledge the importance of those

561
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,480
regionalized

562
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,240
studies enigma gave me this opportunity

563
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
to talk to you here and the guys are

564
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,080
doing a great job but we need more

565
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,640
we need much more because for instance

566
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,440
we have

567
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,840
specific issues and specific venues to

568
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,880
publish

569
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,600
systematization of knowledge papers to

570
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,720
publish

571
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,600
a survey papers to publish offensive

572
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,000
work

573
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,200
so what about regional studies

574
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,919
the does your cover papers includes the

575
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,559
call for

576
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,520
regional studies and if you are

577
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,720
developing a model

578
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
or if you are reviewing a paper about a

579
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,760
model get

580
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,559
rid of the concept that everything

581
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,600
should be balanced

582
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,520
you start thinking about the real world

583
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,880
what can go wrong

584
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
in the real world things might get very

585
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
awkward very fast

586
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,960
so think about unbalanced data set and

587
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
embellished

588
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,919
types of malware and if you are running

589
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,840
a business

590
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,679
are you sure that you understand your

591
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,000
customers needs do you understand what

592
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
happens in the country

593
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,919
in which your customer lives do you have

594
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,200
a local team

595
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
there to help you understand what

596
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,440
happens in the local scenario

597
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
by this time you are leaving everybody

598
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
is working from home so there's no

599
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,360
excuse anymore to have a local team

600
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,439
elsewhere all around the world

601
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,480
and that's it i hope i might have helped

602
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,200
it

603
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,840
and thanks for having me

604
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,639
you
