00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,160
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,559
i want to start this talk by asking you

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,360
to imagine

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,079
slightly different reality i want you to

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,080
imagine that all the elections can be

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
measures that the security community had

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,640
advocated for years were in place

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,960
risk lending audits in every state every

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,039
vote cast using voter verified paper

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,840
ballots

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,840
and widespread independent security

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,119
testing

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,280
my question to you is would the public's

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,160
confidence

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,520
in the election be any different i would

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,360
argue that we'd not see a sizeable

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,800
increase in trust

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,320
to those of us who understand these

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,000
methods we'd certainly have more

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,559
confidence but to a large percentage of

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,440
the population

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,879
who are already inclined to believe

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,520
conspiracy theories and spurious claims

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,079
supposed security guarantees by security

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,120
experts

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
don't hold much more credence than the

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,719
current statements by election officials

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,520
or security experts

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
what's more many of the claims made

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,959
about this election could not be

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,360
disproven by these security measures

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,280
if dead people are voting which they're

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,600
not paper ballots and risk learning

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,080
audits

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
wouldn't catch that and if there is a

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
conspiracy wide enough to implant

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,640
software

38
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,799
and all states change results in votes

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,479
which again is bogus

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,479
surely the election officials could also

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,040
lie about augmented results

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,960
indeed in many of the most contentious

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,600
states best practices are already in

44
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,560
place

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,119
georgia and michigan both conducted full

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
risk living audits with the voter

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
verified paper trails

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,840
georgia conducted a full hint recount of

49
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,439
ballots antrim county michigan

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,840
the home of vote champion conspiracies

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,680
confirmed its results in the zero limit

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,600
race limiting audit

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,520
so if the public does not trust election

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,759
results even when scientific evidence

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,200
proves that they are valid

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,399
does this mean that all election

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,479
security efforts are in vain

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
after all if the golden election is to

59
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,479
convince a loser that they lost

60
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,560
the loser happens to be inconvincible

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,399
can any amount of evidence increase the

62
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,680
public's confidence in the election

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,399
i would argue that to the country having

64
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:10,878
proof

65
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,599
is immensely important but we need to go

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,640
further than that

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
it's not just enough to have the proof

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
but we must work actively to ensure that

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,120
the public

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,879
is confident in the results of the

71
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,120
election so what does this mean in

72
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
practice

73
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,080
we have to focus on the entire spectrum

74
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,200
of the election

75
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,120
what i call the title of this talk the

76
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,680
full stack of election security

77
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,280
election security is more than it is

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,800
voting machines

79
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,239
election security encompasses the

80
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,239
security of election support systems

81
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,239
like voter registration databases

82
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,840
election and reporting

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
electronic poll books because if an

84
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
adversary compromises any one of these

85
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,680
technologies then trust in the election

86
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,720
is lost

87
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,200
even if votes themselves aren't changed

88
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
election security also involves

89
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
campaigns like we saw in 2016 because if

90
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:56,720
a

91
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,800
sophisticated adversary can compromise a

92
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
campaign and leak down to

93
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,120
materials this can truly damage that

94
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,760
campaign strategy going forward

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,640
and results in the public not knowing

96
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
who to trust

97
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,560
election security also involves missing

98
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,840
disinformation

99
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
because an adversary who's able to

100
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,879
convince the public that election

101
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,400
results are unfair

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
has happened this election with domestic

103
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,159
actors

104
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,159
has undermined the results of the

105
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,080
election we must consider

106
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,599
all of these aspects of election

107
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,519
security as a whole if we want to

108
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,360
improve both the security of elections

109
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,319
and people's confidence going forward so

110
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,840
in the remainder of this talk i'm going

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,799
to walk you through

112
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,480
areas for improving each of these

113
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
components of the full stack of election

114
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
security

115
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,440
if there's one takeaway from this talk

116
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
it should be then or to achieve full

117
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,400
stack security

118
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,040
the parts must work in tandem it's not

119
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
enough just to combat disinformation for

120
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,799
instance in isolation

121
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,560
but rather we must build on the work to

122
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,239
secure the election infrastructure in

123
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,239
order to combat claims about supposed

124
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,480
flexion irregularities

125
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,760
i'll start with the election

126
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
infrastructure itself the average

127
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,439
person might think of just voting

128
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,439
machines as the election infrastructure

129
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,040
but there is really a wide range of

130
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
technologies deployed

131
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,239
any of which could affect trust in the

132
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,720
election if compromised

133
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,199
first the voting process this is where

134
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,959
the vast majority of research has been

135
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,759
focused

136
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,839
and where we've seen the most progress

137
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,840
we've had advances in basic areas such

138
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
as requiring voter verified paper trails

139
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
in most states for voting machines

140
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
as well as the deployment of risk

141
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,759
limiting audits to turn these paper

142
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,520
trails into proof

143
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
that the election result was most likely

144
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
correct

145
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
further development of properties such

146
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
as inta and verifiability have provided

147
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,080
means to give voters

148
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
proof that their votes were correctly

149
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
cast and that the tallied result is

150
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,520
valid

151
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
increased availability of software such

152
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
as microsoft's election card

153
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
has made it easier for any election

154
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,520
official to run and attend verifiable

155
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
advances

156
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
these are all truly great advances and

157
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
we should be celebrating them

158
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
but there's more work to be done we must

159
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
continue working to deploy these systems

160
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,600
and focus on making them usable

161
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,520
further as evidenced by this past

162
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,240
election in-person voting alone cannot

163
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,199
suffice

164
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,880
we must aim to provide these same

165
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
guarantees in remote settings

166
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
such as mail and voting being able to do

167
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
this would have the added benefit of

168
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,039
helping for a few criticisms of voter

169
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,080
fraud made about remote voting systems

170
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
of course when we're talking about

171
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,360
remote voting there's also internet

172
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,840
voting

173
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,080
everyone's favorite topic we should be

174
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,560
having a nuanced conversation here

175
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,800
we cannot do internet voting securely

176
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,560
today as evidenced by

177
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
recent studies from the mit as well as

178
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,160
one they did with the university of

179
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,759
michigan

180
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,160
this is not to say that with sufficient

181
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
research it won't be possible

182
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,840
years or decades in the future and we

183
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,600
can't deny that there are benefits of

184
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,000
internet

185
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,840
voting such as potentially increased

186
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
turnout and convenience during the

187
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,639
pandemic

188
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,400
research into internet voting by

189
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
necessity would tackle hard problems in

190
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
computer security

191
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
such as combating malware and accessible

192
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,280
authentication methods

193
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,199
we should explore these areas and if we

194
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,639
are somehow able to solve

195
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,800
enough to make internet coding secure

196
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
acknowledge that would be fantastic

197
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,199
of course these are all research level

198
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,039
problems and we are a long way away from

199
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,000
solving them

200
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
but that doesn't mean that we can't work

201
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
on them and can try to make it work

202
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,240
further we need to be accepting that in

203
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,360
the meantime

204
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
we need to make voting methods

205
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,120
accessible to everyone

206
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,440
and this includes in remote settings

207
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,360
systems such as remote accessible book

208
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,000
by mail

209
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
by which a voter receives their valid

210
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
online can market online

211
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,840
but return it physically through the

212
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,720
mail

213
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,199
allow a middle ground where we can still

214
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,160
have integrity

215
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
elections because there's a paper ballot

216
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,080
the voter can check that

217
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,319
but we can also improve accessibility in

218
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
these remote settings

219
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,880
okay so moving to election support

220
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
systems such as voter registration

221
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,520
databases

222
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,080
election reporting websites electronic

223
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,039
poll books

224
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,800
we have a whole host of systems that are

225
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
less studied but i would argue equally

226
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,240
important

227
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,520
part of the reason that they are less

228
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
studied may be that they appear well

229
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
boring at first glance voter

230
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,599
registration database is a database and

231
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,400
i thought we saw

232
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,880
sql detection 15 years ago election

233
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,960
night reporting is a static website

234
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,319
and we've known about public key

235
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,240
cryptography to sign those results for

236
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,759
40 years

237
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
first it's clear that what currently

238
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,440
exists just isn't working

239
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,919
in 2016 we saw targeting of all 50

240
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,400
states voter registration databases

241
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
russians breached two states including

242
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,440
illinois my home state and arizona

243
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
indeed when i was registering to vote in

244
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,560
2018

245
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,639
two years later in illinois i noticed

246
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
that the sql injection vulnerability

247
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,000
still hadn't been patched

248
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,759
although they were able to fix it once i

249
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
told them about it it's clear that we

250
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
still have a long way to go if we want

251
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,520
for

252
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
systems to be truly secure

253
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,919
part of the problem is that there is

254
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,680
little to no public scrutiny at most of

255
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,039
these systems

256
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,560
the election assistance commission

257
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
certification process

258
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
which itself does have many flaws

259
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,560
doesn't cover election support systems

260
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,240
and with a little published research on

261
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,000
these systems you really don't have

262
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
any idea what's going on under the hood

263
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,039
election night reporting is another area

264
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,960
that could have wide-ranging effects in

265
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,879
public confidence even if the actual

266
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,680
results aren't

267
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,720
changed what we see here is anton county

268
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
michigan

269
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
which we saw in 2020 had effects on

270
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
public confidence from an

271
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,520
administrative era led to incorrect

272
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,958
reporting of results

273
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,440
while errors like this can be prevented

274
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
it's clear that deliberative attack on

275
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,039
such systems would affect public

276
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,399
confidence

277
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
we can work to improve the security of

278
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
these systems as well as educate the

279
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
public that these

280
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,440
the results that they see on election

281
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
night aren't official results

282
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
to combat this and all the risks to

283
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
election support systems

284
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,519
we desperately need public security

285
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
research this can be difficult when it

286
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,480
might not

287
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
even be possible for a security

288
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,399
researcher to get their hands on them

289
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
one way to solve this would be requiring

290
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,720
that all such systems are open source

291
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
which will allow public scrutiny and

292
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,120
hold vendors accountable

293
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,880
a lot of the trouble with election

294
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,959
support systems isn't that we don't know

295
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,880
how to do it securely but just that they

296
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
aren't done securely in practice

297
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
a lot of this is an exercise in making

298
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,000
the right technology

299
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
and security measures available to

300
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
election officials

301
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,880
election officials shouldn't have to

302
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,279
reinvent the wheel rather than hosting

303
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:29,920
their

304
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,240
own mail servers which many of them do

305
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
they could rely on commercial products

306
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,480
like female which has better security

307
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,720
than they could ever obtain themselves

308
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,320
these platforms have done a commendable

309
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
job of making their services available

310
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,519
to these entities

311
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,360
we should continue aiming to expand both

312
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,279
the breadth and depth of these services

313
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,000
offered

314
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
so that election officials can choose

315
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,680
from secure technology

316
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,399
out of the box and be able to improve

317
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
the security of their election support

318
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,839
systems

319
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,720
okay so moving to campaigns this is also

320
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:00,959
an

321
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,200
area where we've seen large attacks

322
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
shown to the right here is the phishing

323
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,959
email that was sent to john podesta in

324
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,320
2016

325
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
which stemmed arguably the largest

326
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,240
foreign interference campaign in united

327
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
states history

328
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,600
podesta's clicking of this link allowed

329
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,519
russian hackers to access and leak

330
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,120
thousands of emails related to the

331
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,040
clinton campaign which received

332
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,600
widespread media coverage

333
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
campaigns today remain the largest

334
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
unknown election security

335
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,279
since campaign security continues to be

336
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,959
shrouded in secrecy

337
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
what i can say is that we need to change

338
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
the security

339
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
campaign security must be viewed as

340
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,880
nonpartisan any compromise of a campaign

341
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,959
has been attacked on american democracy

342
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,720
itself regardless of political

343
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,079
affiliations

344
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,560
it just adds transparency with voting

345
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
systems

346
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
and election support systems can improve

347
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,720
their security

348
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
so can transparency in the security of

349
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,640
political campaigns

350
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,720
improve their security going forward

351
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,959
imagine if a campaign was able to share

352
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,560
debt that they received with other

353
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,839
campaigns

354
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,160
and were able to see common threats and

355
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
able to defend against these together

356
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,000
i think we'd be in a much better state

357
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,959
so let's work on

358
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,519
viewing campaign security as nonpartisan

359
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,440
allowing campaigns to work with each

360
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,079
other

361
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,079
as well with trusted bodies such as the

362
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,079
federal government and other

363
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,480
companies that seek to help in order to

364
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,240
truly improve their security going

365
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
forward

366
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,079
media also definitely has role to play

367
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,959
here

368
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,320
when the russian military started

369
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
leaking emails through wikileaks

370
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,880
in 2016 media outlets were quick to

371
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,920
cover them widely

372
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,279
without leaving with the potentially

373
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,600
nefarious nature behind the leaks

374
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,680
though media has improved its practices

375
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
somewhat such as with the coverage of

376
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,680
the hundred buying emails in 2020

377
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
there's still much room to improve

378
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,279
including well-defined practices around

379
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,040
leaked information

380
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
campaigns could also commit to for

381
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,639
instance now relying on leaked

382
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,160
information

383
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,240
of their competitors in order to advance

384
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,639
themselves

385
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
finally we have the problem of public

386
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,720
confidence elections are only valid when

387
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,839
people believe them

388
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,680
and this and disinformation pose an

389
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,320
existential risk to democracy

390
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,639
this can be foreign or domestic we saw

391
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,000
large attention towards russian

392
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
disinformation in 2016

393
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but the story in 2020 was largely

394
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,120
domestic

395
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,519
indeed the damage done by domestic

396
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,120
actors this past election was

397
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
magnitudes larger than a foreign

398
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,000
adversary could ever hope to achieve

399
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,519
in the face of widespread missing

400
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,519
disinformation election officials had to

401
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,040
become experts not only running

402
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,680
elections

403
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
but also in convincing the public that

404
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
they were accurate in the wake of false

405
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,320
information

406
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,760
this is where technical election

407
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,519
security measures came

408
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,320
to our aid what we saw in 2016 was

409
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
election officials pointing to measures

410
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,839
the election security community had been

411
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,200
talking about for years

412
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
paper ballots wrestling audits and

413
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
others in order to defund groomers

414
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
floating around

415
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,320
one place where we saw this was says

416
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
rumor control website which was one of

417
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,839
the most viewed government websites

418
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,440
around the election time

419
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,760
and contained technical reasons why

420
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
certain election security rumors

421
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,839
still hold any weight because we had

422
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,079
proof with for instance paper ballots

423
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,639
or robust chain of custody that the

424
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,680
election results

425
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,959
could be trusted let's clear that large

426
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,800
percentage of americans still did not

427
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,160
believe the results

428
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
this was a useful case study and seeing

429
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
how election security measures

430
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
can be leveraged to help make the case

431
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
to disbelieving public that the results

432
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
were indeed fair

433
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,839
by expanding technical security measures

434
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
as i discussed earlier we can increase

435
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,560
the number of

436
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,399
examples that election officials can

437
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,920
point to and efficacy of their debunks

438
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,440
it can be useful to think of missing

439
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,519
disinformation as a problem of supply

440
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,720
and demand

441
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
we've seen actions that could be taken

442
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,560
both on the supply side and the demand

443
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,199
side

444
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,680
on the supply side we've seen recently

445
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,959
platforms take action

446
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,120
downrank or even deep platform certain

447
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
users

448
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,959
as well as placing for instance

449
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
intersexuals to

450
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,360
suggest to users that that information

451
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,959
they are sharing may be false or

452
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,720
misleading

453
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
the election has also validated the role

454
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,079
of institutions in protecting our

455
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,120
democracy

456
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
from the election officials who maintain

457
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
the integrity of their elections

458
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
the state lawmakers who vote to certify

459
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
the results judges who tossed on bogus

460
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,079
cases

461
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,839
and federal agencies who debunked

462
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,000
floating rumors it's clear that these

463
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,320
institutions can withstand an attack on

464
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
democracy

465
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
as part of this it was also crucial for

466
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,079
election officials to be providing trust

467
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,240
information to their constituents and

468
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,639
for media outlets to relay these debunks

469
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
in order to set the record straight

470
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
so these are all actions that can be

471
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,800
taken on the supply side

472
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,320
and we've seen some limited

473
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,120
effectiveness and at least reducing

474
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,800
the gravely potential impact of many

475
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,040
disinformation narratives tackling the

476
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,120
demand side is much more long term

477
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
but i would argue that's equally

478
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,800
important we now have a problem in this

479
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,399
country where individuals aren't just

480
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,920
spreading disinformation

481
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,399
but people actively want to hear them

482
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,680
this is a tough problem

483
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,079
we need to look to areas such as media

484
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,959
literacy

485
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
or increase civic identification to

486
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,199
reduce people's susceptibility

487
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,800
and desire to hear this type of

488
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
information

489
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,240
clearly we still have a long way to go

490
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
with disinformation

491
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,680
and we need research to guide this fight

492
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
on january 6

493
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,680
2021 we saw the real world impact of

494
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,279
months of different information spread

495
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,079
by political

496
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,120
leads social media platforms retroactive

497
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
actions came too late to prevent the

498
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,279
damage

499
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,320
already done one major question is what

500
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,519
forms of actions can

501
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,639
platforms take to effectively limit

502
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,079
the real world impact of disinformation

503
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,839
with the recent deep platformings it's

504
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
to be seen whether some of this

505
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
disinformation simply fizzles out or

506
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
whether it moves to other platforms

507
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,720
which will also need to be monitored

508
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
one certainty however is that the

509
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
problem of disinformation extends well

510
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,839
beyond social media

511
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,320
we now have an incredibly polarized

512
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,920
social

513
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,759
political environment and significant

514
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,440
portions of americans are inclined to

515
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,959
flee false narratives

516
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,560
in order to further their political

517
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,720
cause we need to critically evaluate

518
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
what has led to this

519
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
and take measures to stop this such by

520
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
investing in reducing the demand for

521
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,360
disinformation

522
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720
in civics education media literacy

523
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
all right so we've laid out different

524
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,920
actions of

525
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
different aspects of an election that

526
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,920
need improving my final point is that

527
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,600
these are achievable

528
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,839
we need to look no further than the past

529
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,440
successes the election security

530
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,880
community has had

531
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,480
in order to see that improvement is

532
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
possible

533
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,680
we had a significant increase in the

534
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,440
number of balance cast with the paper

535
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
trail in 2020 upwards of 90

536
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
and election officials are increasingly

537
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,600
deploying systems

538
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,440
like risk limiting audits to improve

539
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
learner's confidence and results

540
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
we must then work to apply these past

541
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,160
successes to other areas of elections

542
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,880
even if they appear boring even then a

543
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,320
large part of this still requires

544
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
applying known security measures

545
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,400
to build these systems we need to either

546
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,160
build these ourselves or ensure that the

547
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
proper incentives exist for voting

548
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,280
companies to deliver

549
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,319
more secure technology a good starting

550
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:12,799
point is

551
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,039
election support systems where we've

552
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,480
seen that current

553
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,520
deployed systems just don't meet the bar

554
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,439
let's work with election officials to

555
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,640
understand where their greatest

556
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,839
challenges are

557
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
and develop technologies that can

558
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,039
alleviate security risks

559
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,039
with voter registration databases for

560
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,320
example

561
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
can we build a voter registration

562
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,400
database that's truly verifiable

563
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,320
allowing voters to know for certain that

564
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,919
they're registered and preventing

565
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,559
widespread

566
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,520
tax that remains to be answered we can

567
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
only know if we start working on it

568
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,200
we should also strive to engage in

569
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,640
public research

570
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
election vendors and states have finally

571
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
begun to open their doors to public

572
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
research under standard vulnerability

573
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
disclosure policies

574
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,760
these are policies that we've seen in

575
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,600
other industries for years

576
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
and we've started to normalize the idea

577
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,520
of having vulnerabilities acknowledging

578
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,280
where your weaknesses are and working to

579
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,480
fix them

580
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,840
the crucial component of these

581
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,919
vulnerability disclosure policies

582
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,600
is that they define a scope that

583
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
researchers can test

584
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,440
which many of them are any public-facing

585
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
infrastructure of that company

586
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,760
or in the case of for instance ohio the

587
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,880
state

588
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
they also give legal protection to

589
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
researchers that they can be confident

590
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
that testing these systems will not lead

591
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,880
to legal action

592
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,640
which we have seen since it's in the

593
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,039
past with voting companies taking legal

594
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,880
action against researchers

595
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
and finally they allow publicly

596
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,160
disclosing vulnerabilities after a

597
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
certain time frame which is

598
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,840
the most important to foster a culture

599
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,440
of accountability

600
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,200
for vulnerabilities found in election

601
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
systems the next step here is to make

602
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,840
vendor systems publicly available

603
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
and then start public research into

604
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
these systems with forms like the deaf

605
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
converting village we've already started

606
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,919
doing this

607
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,840
and we can further strengthen this by

608
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,679
following the vendors and involving

609
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
election officials in the fight to make

610
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,720
these systems more secure

611
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,960
so with all this election security is a

612
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,720
problem that can only be solved by

613
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
working together

614
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,240
security experts election officials

615
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,400
lawmakers social scientists election

616
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,960
vendors

617
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,919
and others must collaborate together in

618
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,919
order to fully approach the problem

619
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,679
election security is a full stack

620
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
problem we need to take a full stack

621
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,400
approach to fix

622
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,360
it thank you and i can now take

623
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,440
questions
