1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,080
hi everyone

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
i'm delighted to be here at enigma today

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,440
to present work that i've been doing

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,799
with patrick gage kelly

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,800
tara matthews and ellie burstein with

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,080
the help of many others

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
on digital security and u.s political

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,920
campaigns

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
to get started i'd like to ask you to

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,519
imagine something

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,199
what if your personal email account

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,960
getting hacked could launch conspiracy

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,519
theories

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,439
that could lead to years of online and

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,040
offline harassment of those you

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,480
communicated with

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
contribute to foreign interference in

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
what are supposed to be free and fair

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,640
elections

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,079
as well as meaningfully disrupt

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,640
democracy as some of you may remember

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
from 2016 here in the us

23
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,879
these are real risks for the population

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,559
we're going to be talking about today

25
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,480
that is people who are involved with

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,559
political campaigns

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,000
now what if to help do your part to

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
prevent that from happening you have to

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,760
fundamentally change your professional

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,079
and personal technology related habits

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,239
and the habits of those you work with

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,760
and don't forget that you don't work in

33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,239
tech

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,159
you didn't study computer science and

35
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,760
your digital security knowledge is

36
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,040
limited

37
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
of course this starts with your needing

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,479
to understand that you really are a

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:12,960
target

40
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,040
and that the risk is very real you may

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
not fully appreciate that because this

42
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
is all relatively new in the political

43
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,000
campaign space

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,040
you already have too much to do you also

45
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,720
need to have a reasonable understanding

46
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
of the new threats you face

47
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,799
and what to do about them all while

48
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,479
you're working in a fast-paced

49
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,880
hectic temporary environment where

50
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,119
winning the election is the top priority

51
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,479
and anything that doesn't clearly

52
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,640
contribute to that is is perceived to be

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
a waste of time and effort

54
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
and may even be considered by some to be

55
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,520
an irresponsible use of your time

56
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,960
now you might be thinking that not all

57
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,560
hacks are going to lead to an outsized

58
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
outcome like that

59
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
and you'd be right but real damage to

60
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,759
campaigns is very possible

61
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
and that can in turn weaken the small d

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,479
democratic institution of elections

63
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
for example as part of a congressional

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,360
campaign committee hack in 2016

65
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
campaign strategy documents were leaked

66
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,640
for a primary race

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,680
for a seat in the house of

68
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
representatives the candidate whose

69
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,599
strategy documents were leaked

70
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,040
lost that primary race as the candidate

71
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,879
explained to the new york times

72
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,480
it was like i was standing out there

73
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
naked our entire internal strategy plan

74
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,319
was made public

75
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,319
and suddenly all this material was out

76
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,879
there and could be used against me

77
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,959
this example as well as the higher

78
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,760
profile attacks in the us of 2016

79
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,519
illustrate how security attacks on

80
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,599
campaigns can damage campaigns

81
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,160
and even change the outcome of elections

82
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
security is an important part of winning

83
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,239
elections and of protecting the small d

84
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,599
democratic institution of elections

85
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,760
for the remainder of today's talk we're

86
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
going to briefly go over how the

87
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
security needs and practices of people

88
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,599
involved in political campaigns differ

89
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,959
from other organizations

90
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,280
and the general population then we'll

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,640
talk about what we did

92
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
specifically our qualitative research

93
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,959
with people who had extensive experience

94
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,959
with u.s political campaigns

95
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
and our expert roundtable where we

96
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,800
brought together more than 40 experts

97
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,720
from across the political spectrum

98
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
the technology industry and academia to

99
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,120
discuss how to improve security

100
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,680
practices on political campaigns

101
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
we'll share two themes from our work

102
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,959
that help highlight what a complicated

103
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,239
space this is

104
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,720
first the many accounts this population

105
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,280
uses

106
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
and second their account security

107
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,680
practices with a focus on their use and

108
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,040
understanding of two-factor

109
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,239
authentication

110
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,080
and we'll conclude by suggesting how the

111
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
security community can help support this

112
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
population moving forward

113
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,799
since everyone can benefit from strong

114
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
digital security practices

115
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,400
you may be wondering how campaigns are

116
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,159
different from many other organizations

117
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,159
for the general population

118
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,560
here a study participant summarized what

119
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,080
campaigns are like

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,319
campaigns are totally transient and

121
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,239
almost everybody gets hired in the three

122
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,000
months prior to the election

123
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
there's really very few incentives for

124
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,680
any kind of security rigor

125
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
because you're up against the clock and

126
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
faced with the ticking clock

127
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
everything pales let's talk about some

128
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
key ways campaigns are different

129
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,360
for one thing they face an outsized risk

130
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
of being attacked compared to many

131
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,920
organizations

132
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
and the general population political

133
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
campaigns are targeted by determined

134
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,040
well-resourced sophisticated attackers

135
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
often nation states

136
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,639
and their risk isn't the only thing that

137
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,520
can be outsized the outcomes can be too

138
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
a successful attack on someone from this

139
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
population can range from embarrassing

140
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,120
that individual or derailing their

141
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,840
campaign

142
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,639
to weakening democracy the impact of an

143
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,840
attack can be disproportionate for this

144
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,800
population

145
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
campaign culture is also different from

146
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
other organizations

147
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,919
like the ones that many of you may work

148
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,280
for

149
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,759
for one thing campaigns are short-lived

150
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,840
participants describe campaigns as being

151
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,320
similar to startups with a quick ramp up

152
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,479
no existing security infrastructure and

153
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,639
an abrupt ending

154
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
campaigns typically have only enough

155
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,320
money to survive a hectic cycle of

156
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,160
campaigning with minimal staff

157
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,440
depending on the race size or

158
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,280
competitiveness of course

159
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,039
these constraints can make investments

160
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,800
in security a hard sell

161
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,240
especially at the beginning of the

162
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,919
campaign which is often

163
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,680
also when processes and habits are

164
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
established that can be difficult to

165
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,039
change later in the cycle

166
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,280
even if security expertise is eventually

167
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
brought on

168
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,039
their short lifespan and limited

169
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,479
financial resources

170
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,039
also make campaigns chaotically busy

171
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,800
intense time pressure can lead to the

172
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,639
perception that there's little to no

173
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,759
time for extra security and finally

174
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
campaigns have amorphous boundaries

175
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,919
campaigns work with people from many

176
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,680
different external organizations

177
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,759
including consultants committee staff

178
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,199
and volunteers

179
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
these organizations range from having no

180
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
i.t or security expertise

181
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
to actually having pretty good i.t and

182
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
security expertise

183
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
another boundary issue is about when the

184
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
campaign officially begins

185
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,000
there are likely to be many

186
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,080
communications about a potential run for

187
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,639
office

188
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
that precede any formal organization or

189
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
infrastructure that may eventually be

190
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
put in place

191
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,479
the end result of this long-established

192
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,560
culture is that campaigns usually have

193
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,319
little security knowledge and are

194
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,759
unlikely to prioritize security

195
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,520
so a lot of what i just shared about

196
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,759
campaigns was reasonably well known from

197
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,000
many helpful articles in the press

198
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,800
however

199
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
in order to get a better understanding

200
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,479
of how to help improve the security

201
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,479
practices of this population

202
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,240
we needed a better understanding of how

203
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,759
campaigns actually work

204
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,520
especially in light of the high profile

205
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,280
attacks of 2016.

206
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
so to do this our approach was to

207
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,199
conduct qualitative user research to

208
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,039
understand the security practices

209
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,800
challenges and perceptions of people

210
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
involved in campaigns

211
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
and then to bring together experts from

212
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,919
across the political spectrum

213
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,840
tech industry and academia in a

214
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
roundtable to prioritize how to help in

215
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,880
2020 and beyond

216
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
for the qualitative research we

217
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,400
conducted in-depth interviews with a

218
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,160
broad range of more than 25

219
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
people involved in u.s campaigns from

220
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,560
across the political spectrum

221
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,960
some were candidates campaign managers

222
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
digital directors it staff

223
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
and more while some worked directly on a

224
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,639
campaign

225
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
others were from party committees super

226
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
pacs campaign specific service providers

227
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,639
and academia

228
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,240
all of whom provided some type of

229
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
service or support for campaigns

230
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,560
most of the participants had at least 10

231
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,919
to 20 years of experience

232
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,080
in some cases more and they'd served in

233
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,919
multiple roles with campaigns over the

234
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,120
years

235
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
most campaigns represented were federal

236
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
for example for the house of

237
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,280
representatives

238
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
senate or president though many of the

239
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
participants had prior experience on

240
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
other types of campaigns as well

241
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,560
for example a gubernatorial race

242
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,039
for the expert roundtable 44 people

243
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,319
attended overall

244
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,759
not including the three of us who

245
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
organized the event

246
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,560
13 were from the republican party 12

247
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
from the democratic party

248
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
10 from tech companies and 9 from

249
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,120
academia or non-partisan political

250
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
non-profits

251
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
28 organizations in total were

252
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,120
represented at the round table

253
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,360
our focus in the expert roundtable was

254
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,039
to discuss how to improve security

255
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:13,759
practices

256
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,039
on political campaigns in particular

257
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,879
we aim to come up with a single piece of

258
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,879
security advice that was largely agreed

259
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
upon by the experts in the roundtable

260
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,680
for the 2020 cycle with this piece of

261
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,479
advice

262
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,120
we were hoping to to both promote a

263
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,720
consistent top piece of advice for the

264
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,000
2020 cycle

265
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
and also help lay the foundation for a

266
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,320
more security focused culture moving

267
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,599
forward

268
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,839
as part of the roundtable we also asked

269
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,080
for attendees input on how our research

270
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,440
findings related to their own

271
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
experiences

272
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,080
there was broad agreement that our

273
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
findings were pretty consistent with

274
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,279
attendees experiences

275
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,120
and that gave us additional confidence

276
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,839
in what we learned from our qualitative

277
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,720
research

278
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
in today's talk we're going to focus on

279
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,640
two themes that emerge from our work

280
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,399
account use and account security

281
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,839
practices

282
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,519
as you can see from this participant

283
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,760
quote nation states are targeting

284
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,440
anything that can make the campaign look

285
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,920
bad and many such things can be accessed

286
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
via accounts

287
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
first let's take a look at account use

288
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,399
we want to acknowledge that every

289
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,760
campaign is different

290
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,760
but what we're about to share seems to

291
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,040
hold pretty well across campaigns today

292
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
people involved with political campaigns

293
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,160
likely use

294
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,760
many different accounts for their

295
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,839
campaign related work

296
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,160
for example the campaign might provide

297
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,000
an account from a workplace system like

298
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,320
a g

299
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,360
suite or m365 and maybe also something

300
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
like dropbox

301
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
people involved with campaigns might

302
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
also use a communication tool like a

303
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,120
slack

304
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
wicker or signal there's probably a

305
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,519
social media presence across various

306
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,880
providers like twitter

307
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,959
instagram facebook and maybe youtube and

308
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,320
tick tock too

309
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,760
they may use zoom facetime meet teams

310
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,680
skype or some other video or phone

311
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
conference provider

312
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,279
they probably do some sort of campaign

313
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,959
related communications across their

314
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,320
personal sms

315
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,120
phone and maybe or really probably their

316
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
personal email and social media accounts

317
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
too

318
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,839
there's a good chance that they updated

319
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,279
their linkedin profile

320
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
to mention their involvement with the

321
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,800
campaign and then there are the accounts

322
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,640
for fundraising like an act blue or a

323
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,279
win red

324
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,240
and the list just keeps going on of

325
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,720
course

326
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,560
there are also campaign related accounts

327
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
that are hyper-shared or hyper-owned

328
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
these might be accounts for press

329
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
fundraising hiring

330
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
and so on many workers need to access

331
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040
them and ownership may change from cycle

332
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,760
to cycle

333
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,839
or sometimes even within the cycle as

334
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,680
the campaign grows or if there are staff

335
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,600
changes

336
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,760
this broad set of accounts often spans

337
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,519
many providers

338
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,040
they are a mix of accounts that were

339
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
created by the campaign for the

340
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
individual

341
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
by the individual for the campaign and

342
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,640
by the individual for other purposes

343
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
something they had before they joined

344
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
the campaign and that they're probably

345
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
going to continue to use after the

346
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,000
campaign

347
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,519
ends and remember that a main goal of

348
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,040
attackers is to go after

349
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
anything that can make the campaign look

350
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,519
bad that means that they even target

351
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,120
accounts that aren't used for campaign

352
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,079
related work

353
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,160
often personal email or social media

354
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,200
accounts

355
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
when you consider the scope of anything

356
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,480
that can derail

357
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
embarrass or disrupt a campaign a pretty

358
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,880
broad set of accounts is potentially at

359
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,959
risk

360
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,079
now that we have a reasonable

361
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,600
understanding of the set of accounts

362
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,120
that need to be protected

363
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
let's consider some aspects of campaigns

364
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
that play important roles in the digital

365
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,480
security of accounts that are at risk

366
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,959
most campaigns don't have i.t staff but

367
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,959
even in the rare cases when they do

368
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
it staff are unable to protect or

369
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
control the many work and personal

370
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,720
accounts that might be attacked

371
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
this can lead the communications and

372
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,720
information vulnerable that if leaked

373
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
could embarrass or otherwise harm the

374
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
campaign

375
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,680
the individual is the only one who has

376
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,519
access to all of the accounts they use

377
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
that an attacker might target

378
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
this means that they need to understand

379
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,959
that these accounts are at risk

380
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,200
that they need to do something about it

381
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,959
that they know what to do about it

382
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,800
and that they prioritize doing something

383
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,880
about it over the myriad other important

384
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,160
things they need to do for the campaign

385
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,839
remember that until the widely

386
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,320
publicized attacks of 2016

387
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
many of them spent little if any time

388
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,079
thinking about account security

389
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,240
and if they did they probably focused on

390
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,200
their main g suite or m365 account

391
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,279
and while awareness of digital security

392
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
has improved considerably since 2016

393
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,600
as has an understanding by this

394
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
population that digital security is

395
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,399
important

396
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,320
there's still a big gap between what the

397
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,399
actual security practices are

398
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,240
and where security experts think they

399
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
ought to be given the threat landscape

400
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
what this population has been focused on

401
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
for quite a long time is winning the

402
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720
election

403
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,200
every action that costs money or time is

404
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
weight against spending that resource on

405
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,839
getting votes

406
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,839
for example if better security means

407
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,760
fewer ads fewer staff

408
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
or is going to take extra time from

409
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
important people they wonder if it's

410
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,800
worth it

411
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
and to return to a point made by bob

412
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,560
lord at enigma 2019

413
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
the account security offerings and user

414
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,720
experience are not standardized across

415
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,600
providers

416
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
that doesn't make it easier for this

417
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,279
population

418
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
so since accounts are so important and

419
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,839
there isn't an it staff who can protect

420
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,920
all of the accounts that are at risk

421
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,279
let's take a look at what account

422
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
security practices are generally like on

423
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,160
campaigns

424
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,839
with the focus on two-factor

425
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,160
authentication since that's a frequent

426
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,000
recommendation from security experts

427
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,800
for this population as with most things

428
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,160
these practices

429
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,399
vary across individuals from being

430
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,480
pretty darn good especially for some of

431
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
those who had direct experience with one

432
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,920
of the 2016 hacks

433
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,680
to maybe not so good but we're going to

434
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
present the general trends we learned

435
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,240
about

436
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,279
let's start with some good news most and

437
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,639
maybe all of them have heard of

438
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,320
two-factor authentication

439
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,399
and they probably use some form of it on

440
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,720
at least one of their accounts

441
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,040
that said it appears that two-factor is

442
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
probably underutilized on those

443
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,680
broad sets of accounts that are targeted

444
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,040
and when they do use it

445
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
they're likely to use a weaker second

446
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,600
factor like codes via sms or an app

447
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,639
generator

448
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,720
factors that many security experts don't

449
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,320
consider to be strong enough for the

450
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,839
threats that this population faces

451
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,600
participants mentioned concerns about

452
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
two-factor a common one

453
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760
was that all second factors require

454
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,519
users to take extra steps

455
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,760
and that means more time and effort this

456
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,360
mattered to busy participants

457
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,600
who describe prioritizing their efforts

458
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,519
by only setting up two-factor on what

459
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,680
they deem to be important accounts

460
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,519
and that often excluded many of the

461
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,199
types of accounts that are targeted

462
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
including personal accounts having

463
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,160
access to their accounts is critical

464
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,079
and they worry that two factor will keep

465
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,079
them or worse the candidate

466
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,639
out of accounts some travel often and

467
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,320
are concerned about having access to

468
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
their second factors on airplanes

469
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
or when they don't have cell service or

470
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,920
wi-fi or when their phone's battery is

471
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,880
dead

472
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
others avoid security keys because they

473
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,720
worry about not having it immediately at

474
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
hand when needed

475
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
and they often don't have access to

476
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,600
campaign tech support for help if they

477
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,000
do get

478
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
locked out because the campaign probably

479
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,399
doesn't have any tech support

480
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,880
now that said account lockout is a real

481
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,399
risk with two factor

482
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,120
however it seems that the population was

483
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
overestimating the likelihood or

484
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,320
frequency of this happening

485
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,240
and underestimating the importance of

486
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
using stronger account security

487
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,639
protections given the threats that they

488
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,399
face

489
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
still others mention that two-factor

490
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,759
often doesn't work well on those

491
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,160
hyper-shared or hyper-owned accounts

492
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,720
especially if for example the account

493
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,800
was established in a previous cycle

494
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
and the codes are still being sent to a

495
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
staffer from last cycle who's no longer

496
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,839
part of the campaign

497
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,079
an important consideration is that many

498
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,600
of them don't understand that different

499
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,959
types of second factors

500
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,440
offer different levels of protection and

501
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
when you're being targeted by determined

502
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,079
sophisticated well-resourced attackers

503
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:04,880
like they often

504
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
are the different factors can make a

505
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
meaningful difference

506
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,720
on a related note while they do

507
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,480
understand that two factors important

508
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
and help secure their accounts

509
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
they often don't know or can't explain

510
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,000
why and they aren't aware that they

511
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,279
should use it to protect

512
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,759
most of their accounts we believe that

513
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,680
all of this contributes to an under use

514
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,519
of the most secure forms of two factor

515
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,040
on the various accounts of theirs that

516
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
are targeted

517
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,759
so what does all of this mean as you may

518
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,560
have seen

519
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
two governmental election committees put

520
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
out a joint statement in november

521
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
that the november third election was the

522
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,199
most secure in american history

523
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,959
google and microsoft also issued

524
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,560
statements that nation states had

525
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
attempted to hack the campaign and

526
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,560
personal accounts of people on campaigns

527
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,480
but as far as they could tell none of

528
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,000
the attempts were successful

529
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,959
so is everything fixed are we good no

530
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,399
everything isn't fixed

531
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,199
this population faces an evolving threat

532
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,320
landscape

533
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
there are also plenty of elections

534
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,279
around the world that are gonna face

535
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,880
similar challenges

536
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,760
and even in this most secure 2020 cycle

537
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,959
in the u.s

538
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
several news articles in october

539
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,880
reported confirmed as well as purported

540
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,599
campaign-related hacks

541
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,359
we believe that security attacks like

542
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,199
that shouldn't influence the outcomes of

543
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,559
elections

544
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,720
as one of our participants explained

545
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,039
security and politics should be separate

546
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,959
if you're a candidate you should win or

547
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
lose on your best day based on who you

548
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,600
are

549
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
not because your email got popped and

550
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
posted online by a nation state cyber

551
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,520
security team

552
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,280
so if you're curious to know how you

553
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
might be able to help this population

554
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
moving forward

555
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
let's talk about what we as a security

556
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,919
community can do

557
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,480
first we think more research would help

558
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,919
from further foundational

559
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
exploratory research about the space to

560
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
tactical usability studies of specific

561
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,160
protections

562
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,840
we as a community could learn how to

563
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
better support this population

564
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
by further understanding them and their

565
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,280
use of technology

566
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
this includes conducting research around

567
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,440
the world and with an even broader range

568
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
of campaigns and campaign workers

569
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,840
including down ballot races volunteers

570
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
and more

571
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,039
we also think that there is an

572
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,720
opportunity to better support this

573
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,640
population with very robust

574
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
very usable security protections

575
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,640
protections that are robust enough to

576
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,320
mitigate the serious and evolving

577
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
threats this population faces

578
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
while being very usable so they don't

579
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,919
substantially add to the perceived time

580
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,080
or effort to use them

581
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
some requests from study participants

582
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,679
and roundtable attendees to make

583
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,280
protections more usable

584
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,039
include considering what kind of

585
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,880
standardization and offerings and

586
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,840
experiences possible across the

587
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,280
platforms and what types of stronger

588
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
protections might be enabled by default

589
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,679
that ladder of which can be particularly

590
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,600
complicated for services that have a

591
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,440
broad user base

592
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
and back to the previous point to do

593
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,120
this well likely involves more user

594
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
research

595
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,039
there's also a real opportunity to

596
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,880
provide this population with security

597
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,160
advice and education

598
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
that's tailored to their needs and

599
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,000
context that prioritizes

600
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,880
exactly what to do and why and by

601
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
prioritizing we don't mean making

602
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,559
everything a critical step

603
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,960
ask yourself who really needs to do what

604
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
and how's that going to help them win

605
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
the election

606
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,919
what is this what is a critical security

607
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,600
action they really need to take

608
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,039
versus something that's a really good

609
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,679
idea but maybe it's not critical

610
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,919
and deliver a consistent message when

611
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,880
they hear different

612
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,720
or even similar things from different

613
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,200
experts that tends to complicate matters

614
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,600
not improve them this suggests a real

615
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,559
need for coordination and cooperation

616
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,799
so before i close i want to share one

617
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,640
more thought from a participant

618
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
what is 100 percent true is that foreign

619
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
adversaries want information

620
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
the faster we all realize that the

621
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,480
better off we're going to be

622
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,640
to see politics and campaigns at all

623
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,400
levels as a fundamental piece of

624
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
democracy that needs to be protected

625
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
for sure foreign adversaries are trying

626
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,919
to attack our systems

627
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
why wouldn't someone think of democracy

628
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,120
as a target

629
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,640
please ask yourselves if you're in a

630
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,120
position to help everyone has a role to

631
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,840
play

632
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,159
given the nature of how campaigns work

633
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,760
no one company committee

634
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
campaign support organization or

635
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
academic institution can fix this on

636
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,600
their own

637
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,520
patrick tara ellie and i would like to

638
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,600
extend a very big thank you to everyone

639
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,840
who participated in our research

640
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
all of our roundtable attendees and in

641
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
several cases their amazing assistants

642
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,240
the many people at google who helped

643
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,559
make this research and roundtable happen

644
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,400
and of course to you for your time and

645
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,640
attention thanks so much i'd be happy to

646
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:49,440
take your questions
