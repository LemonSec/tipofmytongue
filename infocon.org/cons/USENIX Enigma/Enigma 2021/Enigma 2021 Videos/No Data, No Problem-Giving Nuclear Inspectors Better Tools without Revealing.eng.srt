1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,519
no data no problem

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,279
giving nuclear inspectors better tools

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,880
without revealing state secrets

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
twenty years ago this september two

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,359
planes flew into the twin towers in new

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,920
york city

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,160
almost eight years ago two homemade

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,760
bombs were detonated at the finish line

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,120
of the boston marathon

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,200
only a bit more than 26.2 miles away

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,520
from my own front door

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,280
both of these events were horrible acts

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
of terrorism but were tremendously

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,320
fortunate that neither involved a

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,640
nuclear explosive

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,239
in fact we've never had an act of

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,320
nuclear terrorism and a big part of that

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,840
is due to international cooperation to

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,520
safeguard the incredibly potent nuclear

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,239
materials

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,120
at the heart of these weapons but even

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,960
though a nuclear terror catastrophe has

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,079
never occurred

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,359
we can't stop being vigilant

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,960
the role of inspectors from the

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,799
international atomic energy agency

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,119
the iaea is always to stay ahead of

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,799
those looking to divert and misuse

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,000
nuclear material

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
for whatever sinister purposes they can

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
come up with not just nukes but also

32
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,600
things like dirty bombs

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
most of the time this is straightforward

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,520
treaties and agreements with the iaea

35
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,720
dictate who

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,280
what where and when the iaea can inspect

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,799
states that do not comply with these

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,240
rules risk running afoul of

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,360
international law

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,880
like the treaty on the non-proliferation

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,799
of nuclear weapons

42
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,320
all but four countries have signed the

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,159
treaty and on this map they're shaded in

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,360
red

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
signatories possessing nuclear weapons

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
are shaded in blue and

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,880
those without them are shaded in green

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,000
for better or worse

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
as sophisticated data analytics become

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,399
ubiquitous it's anticipated that states

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,240
will also be increasingly reluctant to

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,600
share anything more than the minimum

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,159
amount

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
of information that's required under

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,200
their safeguards agreement the iaea

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
this is not generally because they

57
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
intend to act illegally or make a

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,119
nuclear weapon

59
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,799
but rather because they wish to protect

60
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,560
proprietary business advantages

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
or sensitive state information still

62
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,720
while these protective stances aren't

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,560
necessarily a bad thing when it comes to

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,400
individual national security

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
for the vast majority of states at least

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,800
they may pose an impediment to the iaea

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,920
detecting a diversion

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,840
somewhere and that could lead to a

69
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,400
catastrophe

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
so can we devise a system that appeases

71
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,599
both parties

72
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,440
one that lets states retain high levels

73
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,080
of privacy while the iaea inspectors can

74
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
be notified about real deviations from

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
expected practice

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
well we're looking at the intersection

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,599
of privacy and security

78
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,040
where the cryptographic subfield of

79
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,959
secure multi-party computation becomes

80
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,400
applicable

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
if you aren't familiar with the field

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
secure multi-party computation

83
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,560
or mpc for short allows two or more

84
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,480
parties to jointly compute some function

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,000
of all their inputs together

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
while none of the parties learns

87
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
anything about the input of any other

88
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,840
party

89
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,239
beyond what's implied by the result it

90
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,599
sounds a bit like magic

91
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
but i assure you it's computationally

92
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,720
sound

93
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,480
the idea of npc has its roots in the

94
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,959
late 1970s and early 1980s and i'll

95
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,800
largely be focusing here on one class of

96
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
npc algorithms called garbled circuits

97
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,040
credited to the cryptographer andrew yao

98
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,560
in the 1980s

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
yao presented what he called the

100
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
millionaires problem two millionaires go

101
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,480
out to dinner

102
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,840
agreeing that the richer one covers the

103
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
meal neither wishes to disclose their

104
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
true net worth

105
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
so they devise an algorithm to indicate

106
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
who's paying and nothing else

107
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
there was more formulation in

108
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
mathematical theory that was developed

109
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,280
through the 1990s

110
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,519
and by the early 2000s software was

111
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,799
being written to actually implement

112
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
these algorithms

113
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,159
as computing power has grown the

114
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,760
abilities of software implementations

115
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,720
have grown with them

116
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
with mpc really only entering the scene

117
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
as a practical technology in the past

118
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,360
decade

119
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,680
a couple examples are privacy preserving

120
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920
cryptocurrencies like zcash

121
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,840
or an anonymous study on gender wage

122
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
gaps by boston university in 2015.

123
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
covet 19 contact tracing has also

124
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
recently spiked an interest in these

125
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
algorithms too and so with all this

126
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,519
development

127
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,760
we decided to try applying npc to our

128
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,360
own safeguards problem

129
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,879
at the most basic level we were asking

130
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
the following questions

131
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,439
what can we actually do with mpc which

132
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,040
specific safeguards problems would

133
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
lend themselves to it what types of data

134
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,279
could we analyze

135
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
and why isn't this already being

136
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,798
deployed

137
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,639
let's start with this first question the

138
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,560
key insight about yao's garbled circuits

139
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
and subsequent evolutions of them is

140
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
that they can handle literally

141
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
any calculation that might be performed

142
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
by multiple parties

143
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
if you can program a computer to do it

144
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
you can build a circuit to do it too

145
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,759
and i'll come back to this in a bit as

146
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,320
far as what data we could use well we

147
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,919
decided that an interesting exercise

148
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,000
would be using mpc to analyze the output

149
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
of detectors like

150
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,240
those relied on by iaea inspectors

151
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
since every radioactive isotope think

152
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,600
flavor of an element

153
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
produces a unique radiation signature

154
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,600
measuring these emitted radioactive

155
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,160
particles

156
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,240
can tell an inspector exactly how much

157
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
nuclear material

158
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
and what types are in a location this

159
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
plot of the spectra produced by uranium

160
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,039
ore

161
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
serves as a good illustration you can

162
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,199
see the distinct spectral peaks

163
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,880
each one where the detector measured

164
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
many radioactive particles with the same

165
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,600
energy

166
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
and while none of these peaks actually

167
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
corresponds to the radiation from

168
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,479
uranium itself

169
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,000
they do come from a cocktail of

170
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
radioactive particles that's really only

171
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
produced in this observed ratio

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
by uranium ore taking this idea further

173
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,039
perhaps if we could watch the output of

174
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,880
a detector over time we could flag

175
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,479
measurements with radioactive signatures

176
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,759
for nuclear materials that are

177
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,440
proliferation risks

178
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,600
this is what the iaea inspectors and

179
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
data analysts already do

180
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
but with mpc we could do it obliviously

181
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,440
we'd learn nothing else about the

182
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
material compositions that are picked up

183
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
by the detector

184
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,400
which brings us back to the third

185
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
question

186
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
why hasn't anyone done this yet well

187
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,880
on one hand the technical requirements

188
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,039
of npc mean that only very recently have

189
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,720
off-the-shelf computer systems been able

190
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,080
to handle privacy-preserving

191
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,039
computations

192
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,280
of what i would truly consider data

193
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,639
analytics

194
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,199
additionally the iaea is necessarily

195
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,960
incredibly risk-averse

196
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840
you can't ride the cutting edge without

197
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,880
taking risks

198
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
and when it comes to nuclear security

199
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,880
losing bets are not acceptable

200
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,639
the iea has to ensure that every

201
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,080
technology put into practice

202
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,800
is guaranteed to work often times this

203
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,319
also means deployed technologies are

204
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,080
customized to be extra secure

205
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,400
and extra resilient the ieee's

206
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
technology tends to be tried and true

207
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
not latest and greatest and finally

208
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,639
nuclear safeguards is a small field on a

209
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,759
constrained budget

210
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,840
the pool of expertise is pretty limited

211
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,759
and unlike a lot of tech fields

212
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,400
nuclear safeguards isn't a money maker

213
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,919
that means that the technical overlap

214
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,440
between nuclear fields and

215
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,199
the latest in cryptography is just

216
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,360
pretty small

217
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,800
now before i show you what we

218
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
accomplished i want to take a few

219
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
minutes to explain how npc actually

220
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,960
works

221
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,960
it's super cool but i told you it wasn't

222
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,479
magic and so i'm going to have to back

223
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,160
that up

224
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,440
you may have learned at some point that

225
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,360
any calculation your computer can do can

226
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,319
be performed

227
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,639
using a digital logic circuit this

228
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,440
circuit here

229
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,720
shows a simple calculation is bit a

230
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,360
the circuit's input wire on the top left

231
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,000
greater than

232
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,479
less than or equal to bit b the input

233
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
wire on the bottom left

234
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,919
by adding gates the circuit can be

235
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,599
scaled up to do almost anything

236
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,599
real numbers are reduced to binary and

237
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,960
every addition subtraction

238
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,319
multiplication division square root

239
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,319
modulus exponential you name it

240
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,560
is represented using a complex system of

241
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,680
logic gates

242
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,479
not and or and the like

243
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,680
garbled circuits build on this

244
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
foundation let's look at the two-party

245
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
case

246
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
to keep the focus on safeguards we'll

247
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,280
say one party is a nuclear facility

248
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,759
and the other is the iaea our two

249
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,240
parties agree on a function to compute

250
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,479
for simplicity let's imagine a function

251
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,919
that tells us if the two parties have

252
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,199
picked different numbers

253
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
from just the small set of integers 0

254
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,599
through 3.

255
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,520
since our circuit will work in binary we

256
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,199
convert our integer possibilities to

257
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,080
base 2

258
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
and get 0 0 0 1 1 0

259
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
and 1 1. we see that we have two bit

260
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,720
inputs

261
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,400
for each party each party has two

262
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,080
input wires to the circuit and the

263
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,919
party's integers are only the same if

264
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,639
each bit

265
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,280
in each input is the same the gate that

266
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,160
gives a one

267
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
only when the bits are identical is the

268
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,199
xnor gate

269
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,639
you can see that on this truth table

270
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,840
here we have two of these xnor gates one

271
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
for each pair of bits

272
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
then since both pairs of bits have to be

273
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,120
the same

274
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
an and gate gives us an output value of

275
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,599
1 only when both of the xnor gates

276
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,159
confirm a match

277
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
now this is all relatively

278
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
straightforward and we can see all the

279
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
bits clear as day

280
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,839
however we need the circuit to be

281
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,519
garbled

282
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
let's imagine that the facility goes

283
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,800
through this circuit and replaces the

284
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,279
two values on each wire with two random

285
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,200
strings that only they know

286
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,279
starting with the first xnor gate we

287
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,320
replace the 0

288
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,040
and 1 on the first input wire then 0 and

289
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
1 on the second input wire

290
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
and finally zero and one on the output

291
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
wire

292
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
we repeat this process for the second

293
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
xnor gate

294
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,320
and finally one last time for the and

295
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,920
gate

296
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
after the labels are added we can still

297
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,600
see the pattern from before

298
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,120
but that's the only thing that tells us

299
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
whether a label corresponds to a zero or

300
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
a one

301
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
next the facility uses the input wire

302
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
labels for each gate to symmetrically

303
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,560
encrypt the gate's output wire label

304
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,640
we start in the first table encrypting

305
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,600
the first row

306
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,720
then the second third and fourth the

307
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,279
process is the same in the other two

308
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,519
this produces four encrypted tokens for

309
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,399
each gate

310
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,440
one for each row in the truth table if

311
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,000
the facility

312
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
were to hand you one token for each of

313
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,120
the input wires to a gate

314
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,680
you could only successfully decrypt one

315
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,440
of the four outputs

316
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
and the only thing indicating now which

317
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,519
encrypted token belongs to which row

318
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,440
is the fact that they haven't moved from

319
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,959
where they started

320
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,920
so let's change that

321
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
now remember up until this point every

322
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,760
step we've seen

323
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,440
was performed by one party the facility

324
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,279
the facility knows all the labels and

325
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,880
what values they represent

326
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,399
and so they can give the labels matching

327
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,200
their own input values to the iaea

328
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,800
since the other party hasn't seen any of

329
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
this yet they don't know which random

330
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
label matches which wire value

331
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,320
that label is just a random string to

332
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,680
them

333
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
now the iaea needs to get the labels for

334
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,240
its own input wire values

335
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
but this presents a dilemma it can't

336
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
directly ask the facility for the label

337
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,720
corresponding to its bit choice

338
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
because then the facility knows that the

339
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,040
ieee's input is whichever one it asked

340
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,079
for

341
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,240
likewise the iaea can't be shown both

342
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,920
labels and the matching values because

343
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,959
then it will be able to

344
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,720
decrypt more than just one of the

345
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
encrypted rows in the truth table

346
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,800
we solved this using something called

347
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,279
oblivious transfer we'll treat it as a

348
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,079
black box

349
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
where the generator party can put both

350
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
labels into the box

351
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
and through an interactive process of

352
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,680
encryption and decryption

353
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,079
the iaea gets only one label of its

354
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,120
choice

355
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,079
i'll reiterate that the iaea learns only

356
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
one label and the generator

357
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,640
learns nothing

358
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,959
after executing oblivious transfer the

359
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
ieea has all the labels it needs

360
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,920
labels matching its own known values and

361
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,440
labels matching the facility's

362
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,240
unknown values the iaea can start

363
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,600
walking through the circuit

364
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,839
successfully decrypting only one token

365
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,200
for each gate

366
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,120
this decrypted token reveals the label

367
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
on that gate's output wire

368
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,560
which can then be used as a decryption

369
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,640
key for the next gate

370
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,279
again this process repeats for each gate

371
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,560
in the circuit

372
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,279
finally once the iaea has the computed

373
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,120
label on the circuit's output wire

374
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,800
it can share that label back to the

375
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,279
facility so that the computation result

376
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,519
becomes public

377
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,880
so now that we've covered the

378
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
fundamental cryptography let's get back

379
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,440
to real implementations

380
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,120
i told you before that we wanted to be

381
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
able to identify anomalies in radiation

382
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,760
spectra

383
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,440
effectively demonstrating that mpc

384
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
worked on safeguards data

385
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
at the same time knowing our audience of

386
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,680
safeguards inspectors and data analysts

387
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
we recognized that if this was ever

388
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,839
going to be more than just a fun idea

389
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,519
we needed to be able to do it in a way

390
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,200
that was clear and convincing

391
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
especially the folks at the iaea who

392
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,040
might not be at the forefront of

393
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,120
cryptographic research

394
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
we surveyed available npc software

395
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,279
frameworks and found a pretty wide range

396
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,760
of options available which is great

397
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,600
these were codes that satisfied our

398
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
obvious criteria

399
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
of being able to perform calculations

400
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
correctly while keeping data private

401
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
but all of them presented other

402
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,399
challenges

403
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,880
some were too limited in their ability

404
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
to handle a challenge of this scope

405
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,440
some are no longer maintained others are

406
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,320
commercial and

407
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,760
so while potentially great for a

408
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,920
contract down the line they're not so

409
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,519
great for a highly tailored demo with

410
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,040
full transparency

411
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
but most often the codes where

412
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,240
state-of-the-art research codes

413
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,760
designed to showcase the latest

414
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
development in the field and were just

415
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,600
too sophisticated for building a demo

416
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,920
aimed at a budget constrained inspector

417
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,680
with a relatively limited base of

418
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
expertise

419
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,800
for perspective on this last point there

420
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
was a fantastic systemization of

421
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,279
knowledge study

422
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,920
published in 2019 by researchers at the

423
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
university of pennsylvania

424
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
surveying a selection of mpc frameworks

425
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
and related tools

426
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,279
it estimated that learning building and

427
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,399
testing their selection

428
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
took 750 person hours and even then they

429
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
didn't always succeed

430
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,760
that's a computer science phd candidate

431
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,519
working for a month straight

432
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,279
no breaks no weekends no sleeping

433
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,000
and so we built a prototype of our own a

434
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,720
python package called cipher circuit

435
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
now i confess i'm not a cryptographer

436
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,560
just a nuclear engineer with a passion

437
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,399
for reproducible computing

438
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,000
our prototype evaluates circuits

439
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
successfully and securely

440
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
and while it's admittedly slow it is

441
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,040
highly accessible

442
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,639
here's a quick snapshot showing how the

443
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,399
whole process we just walked through

444
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
can be encapsulated in just a few lines

445
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
of python

446
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,839
the package is designed to be used by

447
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,600
anyone who understands the fundamentals

448
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,720
of garbled circuits

449
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
installed without any headaches and

450
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
inspected thoroughly at

451
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,760
every step of the circuit evaluation

452
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,199
process

453
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,760
but finally after development the time

454
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,519
came to begin testing garbled circuits

455
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:25,839
on

456
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,760
real world time series anomaly detection

457
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,279
data sets

458
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
now the radiation spectra that we were

459
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,320
looking at before

460
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,120
tend to be large sets of data at each

461
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
point in time one may monitor hundreds

462
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
or thousands of channels

463
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,240
each giving a count of how many

464
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
radioactive particles are measured in

465
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,800
some energy range

466
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,680
as you saw earlier we started smaller

467
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
looking to find a univariate time

468
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,279
series that we could analyze first as a

469
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,760
test and we settled on something outside

470
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
the safeguards realm but which i hope is

471
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,120
easily relatable to you all in the

472
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,760
audience

473
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,199
an electrocardiogram signal a heartbeat

474
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,639
here i've shown a sample of heartbeat

475
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,240
data sourced from the beth israel

476
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,680
deaconess congestive heart failure

477
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,720
database

478
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,880
it's pretty obvious just by looking at

479
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,519
it to see where the anomaly is

480
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,079
but for privacy preserving computation

481
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,680
we can't look at it

482
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
instead we coded up a garbled circuit to

483
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,199
analyze the cardiogram

484
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
one party inputs their cardiogram data

485
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,199
the other party inputs parameters of the

486
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
anomaly detection algorithm

487
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
and the result the garbled circuit

488
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,040
identified the exact location of the

489
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,240
anomaly

490
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
but never revealed the actual cardiogram

491
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,120
heartbeat

492
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,360
and so with this successful result we've

493
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
pushed on to something far more relevant

494
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,880
to nuclear safeguards

495
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,399
using a selection of data that was

496
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,399
generously shared by a team at oak ridge

497
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,279
national lab

498
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,040
working on the modeling urban scenarios

499
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
and experiments project

500
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
or muse for short we began applying

501
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
garbled circuits to time series of

502
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,720
radiation spectra

503
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,959
during february 2019 the muse team

504
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,639
collected radiation data from along a

505
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
stretch of road between a research

506
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,000
reactor and another facility inside the

507
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
lab

508
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,399
we knew that at some point during the

509
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
month a metal drum containing a mixture

510
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,160
that included a specific izotope of

511
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
protectinium

512
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,920
that's elemental simple pa and it has

513
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,040
233 protons and neutrons

514
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,560
was moved past a roadside detector

515
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
now this protectinium isotope decays

516
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,320
fairly quickly into an isotope of

517
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,839
uranium that could be used to build a

518
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,040
nuclear weapon

519
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,279
that uranium isotope is exceedingly rare

520
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,720
in the natural environment

521
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
so creating other materials that decay

522
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,560
into it is the only viable means of

523
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,519
production

524
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,519
so watching for the radiation signature

525
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,600
of the short-lived protectinium

526
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,519
is comparable to what an inspector might

527
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,199
be interested in

528
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,600
and so begin our blind treasure hunt

529
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,759
could we identify the exact date and

530
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,759
time when the protectinium passed the

531
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,720
detector

532
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,639
without ever actually looking at the

533
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,880
detector's output

534
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
i'll show you here's an animation of

535
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,759
just a few minutes of data collection on

536
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,839
one morning in late february

537
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,920
the animation is sped up so you won't

538
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
have to stay still quite that long

539
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,319
on the left is the view that a facility

540
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
might have the plot gives the radiation

541
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,079
spectra that was actually measured

542
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
in this case the muse data you can

543
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
hopefully see the jitter at the bottom

544
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,160
of the plot

545
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
that's background radiation it's

546
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,199
everywhere all the time

547
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
including around you right now it's low

548
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,559
enough that it has almost

549
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,039
no impact on your life but the detectors

550
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,599
see it

551
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,959
and so our algorithms must filter it out

552
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,640
then on the right is the view an

553
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,559
inspector might have using a garbled

554
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,520
circuit

555
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
at the top is a rough example of the

556
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,760
radiation signature of the protactinium

557
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
you can see a large peak at around 300

558
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,880
kilo electron volts

559
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,640
kev and a smaller peak at around 400 kev

560
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,919
that's what we've built the garbled

561
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,160
circuit to look for the lower energy

562
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
peak is less likely to show up reliably

563
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,360
on the detector so we're ignoring that

564
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,559
one

565
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
at the bottom is an indicator of whether

566
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,080
the data input by the facility

567
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,320
shows hints of pro-titanium green is

568
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,200
good to go

569
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,080
and red is an anomaly here detected at 9

570
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,360
19 am

571
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,799
it's a success now as i mentioned before

572
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,960
our package is fairly slow and so our

573
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,559
goal is to speed this up to something

574
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,400
approaching real time

575
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
after that ideally we move to implement

576
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,080
the package as a language in and of

577
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,880
itself

578
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,640
akin to most of the existing frameworks

579
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,240
available today where circuits can be

580
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,600
built as computer code

581
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
not wire by wire gate by gate like i

582
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
showed before that gets tedious

583
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
there are also some other obvious

584
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,360
challenges that lay in front of us

585
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
how will we deal with malicious

586
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,880
adversaries these participants who might

587
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
try to subvert the calculation by

588
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
not following the rules of garbled

589
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
circuits and

590
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,280
fortunately this is a problem that's

591
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,880
actually generally been solved in the

592
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,559
literature and so we just need to build

593
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,240
it into our own methods

594
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,640
perhaps more importantly can we prevent

595
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,280
parties from

596
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,600
spoofing their input data garbage in

597
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
garbage out as the saying goes

598
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
but adding techniques like commitment

599
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,120
schemes to the procedure could ensure

600
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,880
that when a party enters data

601
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
it becomes immutable enabling the

602
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
inspector to return and verify its

603
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
authenticity at some point in the future

604
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,880
if it's deemed necessary

605
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,799
despite these challenges i believe that

606
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,640
this technology is needed now more than

607
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,280
ever

608
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,960
as international relationships are

609
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
becoming increasingly strained

610
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
the ability to use trustless

611
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,240
privacy-preserving systems may allow us

612
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,840
to maintain relationships

613
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
and international cooperation around to

614
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,039
nuclear safeguards

615
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,640
hopefully they even present the

616
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,559
opportunity to rebuild trust between

617
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,320
nations that may not currently see

618
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,600
eye-to-eye

619
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,919
and so for all you nuclear inspectors in

620
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
the audience let's consider where npc

621
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,840
might fit into the iaea's future

622
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,440
operations shall we

623
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,240
and for anyone who's left i believe that

624
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
npc could have applications in

625
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,480
almost every aspect of modern life and

626
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,240
so i challenge you to think about where

627
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,919
and when you might desire privacy

628
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,039
preserving computation

629
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,080
in your own daily routine and then

630
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,600
i hope you'll push for mpc to go

631
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
mainstream

632
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,240
you
