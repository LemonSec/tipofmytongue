00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,280
hello everybody

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
one day i was sitting in my office

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,480
minding my own business

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,560
when i started receiving all sorts of

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
weird emails

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,520
at first somebody contacted me saying

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:21,920
that

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,880
the latest u.s election that was the

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,760
2016 presidential election

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,920
had shocked them and they asked for

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,760
advice on how to cope with

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
emerging racism and anti-semitism and so

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,520
on and so forth

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
shortly after i got an email from a

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,680
student asking me for advice

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,320
about the community studies project 12

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
12

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,480
a class which i had no idea what it was

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,399
and then insults and threats

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,039
started arriving and these went on for a

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,520
while

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,480
now what was going on as i found out

23
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,359
later

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,000
somebody posted this screenshot on

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,080
4chan's politically incorrect board

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,439
and this is a screenshot to the webpage

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,640
for a college class

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,520
where the instructor is asking students

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,720
to go

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,880
on fortune and post about lgbt issues

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,439
gender issues women's rights and so on

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,680
and so forth

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
and this is a very alt-right community

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
and so they didn't like it and they

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,520
decided to find out who was behind this

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
and attack them and as you can see at

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:40,880
the bottom

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
the email address of a professor is

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
blanked

40
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,720
but you can see a g and then at

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,600
something.edu they

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
got convinced that it was me they found

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,360
an old email address of me

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
they interpolated it they saw that it

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
fits in the blanks

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,000
they mistyped it but it doesn't matter

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,880
and so they started calling for attacks

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
against me

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,560
they toxed me they posted information

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,639
about my online presence social media

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,959
accounts and so on

52
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,560
and then they said you know let's go and

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
attack this person

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
they also started posting templates of

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,239
emails

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,120
to send me and if you look at this one

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
that is exactly the email that i

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,160
received

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
that i discussed previously the person

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,599
was shocked

61
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,518
about the recent election

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,959
eventually they got convinced that it

63
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,319
wasn't me and in fact

64
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,399
it wasn't me i saw the attack stopped

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,319
this is what we call a raid a

66
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,800
coordinated

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,160
attack geared towards harassing someone

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,400
online

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
and if i experienced it as a white male

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,160
professor

71
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,599
imagine to what extent minorities

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,800
and women are targeted by this

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,720
in fact our measurements which i will

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,440
discuss later in the talk

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
found that from just a couple of

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,599
communities that we're monitoring

77
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,920
we can see a handful of attacks a day

78
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,040
so this is not at the scale of other

79
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,239
security problems

80
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,920
like spam malware fraud but it is very

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
targeted

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,959
and it can cause a lot of harm to its

83
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,920
victims

84
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,840
so this is why i decided to study this

85
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,959
problem

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,720
what can i do about this problem as a

87
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,599
computer security person

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,959
well myself as well as many other

89
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,959
computer security researchers

90
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,959
have been studying coordinated

91
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,440
malicious activity carried out

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,879
automatically

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,640
bots malware spam and so on

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,560
this problem on the other hand is

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
coordinated malicious activity

96
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
carried out by humans

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
there are relations but there are also

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,519
differences but we can see

99
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,080
how people are acting in a coordinated

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,599
fashion

101
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,840
and so what i wanted to do is applying

102
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,320
from computer security bot detection

103
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,079
spam detection and so on

104
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,799
to this problem

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,560
today i will tell you about two types of

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,240
coordinated attacks that we've been

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
seeing

108
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,680
quite a lot the first one targets

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
people posting youtube videos you post a

110
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
video on youtube

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,639
later on somebody will call for an

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,360
attack

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
against you and that video and post

114
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,600
harassing comments and hateful comments

115
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
on that video

116
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,240
the second one are coordinated hate

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,680
attacks against online meeting platforms

118
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,000
so nowadays we're spending most of our

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,199
professional lives

120
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
on zoom or similar platforms

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
attackers are trying to disrupt this

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,880
experience

123
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,039
and just you know post hateful comments

124
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,080
in a meeting annotate on the screen and

125
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,960
all these kind of things

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,360
but first let me tell you about fortune

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,720
a little bit more in particular

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,280
the politically incorrect board on

129
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
fortune

130
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,680
we decided to focus on this platform

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
because anecdotally we've seen them

132
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,479
carrying out

133
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,639
many harassment campaigns including

134
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,120
gamergate

135
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,720
for example also when microsoft put out

136
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,479
the tablet the chatbot that would learn

137
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:44,960
from

138
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,759
its users these people managed to turn

139
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,720
it racist

140
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
in a few hours so we can see how these

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
people have been attacking

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
online platform as well as online users

143
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
for a while

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,600
so what is 4chan fortune is an image

145
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
board where you can post an image

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
and some text create a thread and people

147
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,720
can comment on it

148
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
but it's quite different from other

149
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
social

150
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
online services that we are used to

151
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,360
it is anonymous so there are no user

152
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
accounts

153
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,280
and it's also effeminate so every time

154
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
you create a thread

155
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
another thread must be archived there

156
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,280
can only be a certain number of threads

157
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,840
active

158
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,120
at the same time and once the thread is

159
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,319
archived

160
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
it gets stored in an archive for

161
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,319
a limited period a week typically and

162
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,199
then it's gone forever

163
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,440
and as you can imagine anonymity and

164
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,120
ephemerality

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
sort of facilitate this inhibition so

166
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,319
there is a lot of bad activity

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,599
going on in this community we've been

168
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,280
monitoring for a while

169
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
and we've recently released a data set

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,319
of all the posts that we've been seeing

171
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
over three and a half years we saw 134

172
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
million posts

173
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,919
so it's as much smaller community than

174
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:06,639
twitter

175
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,520
reddit facebook and so on but it's still

176
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,159
quite active

177
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,560
what is our threat model so what i

178
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,240
discussed before in the example that

179
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,199
targeted me

180
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,560
somebody calls for an attack by creating

181
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
a thread

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
on fortune in this case and calls for

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
more people to participate

184
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
and these additional people will find

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,599
information about the person being

186
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
attacked

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,800
online handles email addresses

188
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,639
content like videos photos that this

189
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,080
person posted and so on

190
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,560
pour a report back on the organization

191
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,000
thread

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
and then the attack will happen that

193
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,360
will go and post hateful comments

194
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
on all these platforms and report back

195
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,840
and coordinate with each other

196
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
and so on

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,960
we decided to focus on youtube because

198
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
we found that it's the most popular

199
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,520
platform

200
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
linked on the political incorrect board

201
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,599
of fortune

202
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,319
and also anecdotally we observed many

203
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,199
attacks

204
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,800
against youtube videos we can see an

205
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
example here on the left

206
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,599
what we found is that once the link to a

207
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,520
video is posted on youtube

208
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,039
on fortune sorry we see oftentimes a

209
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,240
spike in comments

210
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
on youtube we find that 14

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,159
of videos that are linked on the

212
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,080
political incorrect board

213
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,958
experienced a lifetime spike within the

214
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,240
lifespan

215
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,479
of a fortune thread remember fortune

216
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,240
threads are ephemeral

217
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,720
on average they last for 47 minutes

218
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,519
this is interesting but it's not

219
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
particularly surprising

220
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,320
so we expect the same to happen on

221
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
social media in general if you post a

222
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,360
video on youtube

223
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,240
a youtube video on facebook you expect

224
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
people from facebook to go and comment

225
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,040
on youtube so we needed a more

226
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,760
sophisticated metric

227
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
and what we did was looking at

228
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,360
the comments on fortune and the comments

229
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,680
on youtube

230
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,839
and then treat them essentially signals

231
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,600
we apply signal processing techniques

232
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
and we try to figure out

233
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,240
what is the synchronization between

234
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,160
these two sets of comments ideally

235
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
based on a threat model we expect

236
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,839
somebody to go post a hateful comment on

237
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,480
youtube

238
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
and instantaneously comment back on

239
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,000
fortune about what they just did

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,480
this will not happen but we expect this

241
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
coordination to be stronger

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
than for videos that are not being

243
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,519
attacked

244
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,080
where people are maybe commenting you

245
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,120
know harmless

246
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,920
messages and this is interesting

247
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,240
because this synchronization this

248
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
cross-correlation

249
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,079
to use a signal processing term

250
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,600
allow us to assign a number

251
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
to a youtube video and we can reason

252
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,600
about that number

253
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
to automatically identify videos that

254
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,040
have been rated

255
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,959
so what we find is that the closer the

256
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,959
synchronization

257
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,480
the closer the synchronization is to

258
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
zero the more hate

259
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,360
comments appear on youtube we use the

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,240
hate based

261
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
api to identify hateful comments

262
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,720
comments containing hate speech

263
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,640
and as you can see in the figure on the

264
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,760
left

265
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,240
the closer to zero the more hate

266
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
comments we see a spike

267
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,000
the farthest from zero so the least

268
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,279
synchronize

269
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,360
the comments on youtube and the comments

270
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,600
on fortune are

271
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,279
the least eight comments we pretty much

272
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
see no hate comments

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,399
if a synchronization is very low

274
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,680
so we can use this number to extract a

275
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,880
set of videos

276
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
for which you are quite confident that

277
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,680
an attack happened

278
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,200
and then what we did was uh analyzing

279
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,320
these videos

280
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
we developed a set of classifiers

281
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,079
looking at all the characteristics of

282
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,360
the videos

283
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,160
where thumbnail the transcript what is

284
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
being said in the video we applied

285
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,519
natural language processing techniques

286
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,160
there the title the category and so on

287
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,800
and our goal here was to aid moderators

288
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
one of the main issues that moderators

289
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
are facing is that there are too many

290
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
videos

291
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,600
and uh it's impossible to analyze all

292
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,720
the comments

293
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
to these videos in a manual fashion so

294
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,200
what we want to do

295
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
is establishing a risk score so once you

296
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,279
upload the video can we analyze it

297
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,399
automatically

298
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
and figure out how likely is it to

299
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,160
receive hate

300
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,600
in the future and this system is quite

301
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,519
effective we have an area under the rock

302
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,360
curve of 0.95

303
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
and in our paper we show that we can

304
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
actually identify trades

305
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,399
that are typical of attack videos and we

306
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,320
hope that this will be used

307
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,920
by moderators in the future to actually

308
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,760
be more proactive in their work

309
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,399
now the events of last year basically

310
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,160
changed the way in which we socialize

311
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,480
and we do

312
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
work in particular we've moved a lot of

313
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,440
our interactions

314
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,480
to online meeting tools like zoom

315
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
google meet webex microsoft teams and so

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,720
on and so forth

317
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,000
and this creates opportunities for

318
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
attackers so we've seen

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,240
an emerging way of coordinated

320
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,279
harassment

321
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,560
which is what we call zoom bumping

322
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,320
in a zoom bombing attack we have a

323
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
similar threat model to what i discussed

324
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
before

325
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,200
but this time the attacker will post a

326
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,360
link to a meeting room

327
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
let's say a zoom meeting and invite

328
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,120
people

329
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
to join that meeting and disrupt it by

330
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,079
setting up you know obscene backgrounds

331
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,760
or annotating the screen or shouting

332
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
profanities and so on and so forth

333
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
so we've seen this happening in the news

334
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
over and over so we wanted to understand

335
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,800
to what extent it's happening and what

336
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
do these attacks look like

337
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
and also what can we do about it

338
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
so here what we did we first identified

339
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,399
10

340
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,399
popular meeting services as i said you

341
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,079
know zoom meet

342
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,240
hangouts webex teams and a few others

343
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,920
we identified links to these platforms

344
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,040
on fortune and twitter

345
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
and then we apply the mixed method

346
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,560
approach so we first

347
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,000
labeled these posts as either calling

348
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,199
for a zumba mig attack or not

349
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,880
and then we analyze them both

350
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
quantitatively with natural language

351
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
processing techniques

352
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,920
and qualitatively with thematic analysis

353
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,680
and we made several interesting findings

354
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,800
first of all we find that 74

355
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,000
of the calls for zoom bombing target

356
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
online classes

357
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
these are college classes and high

358
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,079
school classes

359
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,000
even more interestingly we find that 70

360
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
percent of these attacks

361
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
seem to be called by insiders so these

362
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
are students in the class

363
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,000
who are bored and so they call for

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
strangers to join their classes

365
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,719
and disrupt them

366
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,040
and we also find that this is done in a

367
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
very opportunistic fashion so

368
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,320
these meetings that attackers want to be

369
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,360
disrupted

370
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
are typically happening in real time so

371
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,399
this is not something that's been

372
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,760
prepared ahead of time

373
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,199
and this is interesting and somewhat

374
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,519
surprising because we

375
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,079
expect or at least you know anecdotally

376
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,199
we thought that the attackers would be

377
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,000
would be outsiders

378
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,160
and when you defend from an outside

379
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,120
threat compared to an inside threat

380
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
the way in which you defend from it is

381
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,519
completely different

382
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,480
in fact the way we are defending from

383
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,519
zoom bombing right now

384
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,760
is completely ineffective against

385
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,519
insiders

386
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,680
what we are doing is setting up

387
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,239
passwords

388
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
it's very hard for an attacker to guess

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,639
a password but the insider can just give

390
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,440
it

391
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,680
to the attackers in fact we see

392
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,959
passwords over and over

393
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,279
in these threats in these threads

394
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,160
calling for attacks

395
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,000
we are setting waiting rooms so that the

396
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
instructor can figure out who's a real

397
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,600
student and who's

398
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,399
an attacker and kick out the malicious

399
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,519
users

400
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,519
but we've seen over and over the

401
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,360
students calling for attacks

402
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,839
instructing people to adopt certain

403
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,399
names

404
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,199
who are real students in the class to

405
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,000
make moderation

406
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,399
harder so waiting rooms become in effect

407
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,279
we argue that the most effective way to

408
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
deal with this

409
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,800
is to come up with one-time

410
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,040
unique links for each participant so

411
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,199
that the same link cannot be used

412
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,680
by a mob to attack the service

413
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,839
but at the time i'm presenting

414
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
only two services allow this

415
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
so there is still some work to do there

416
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,040
but at least we identify

417
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,319
an effective mitigation

418
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,639
another thing that we need to keep in

419
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,279
mind is that as computer security people

420
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,279
we tend to

421
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,880
send um we tend to delete

422
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,880
accounts suspend accounts once we find

423
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
somebody misbehaving

424
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
this might work for bots it increases

425
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,160
the

426
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,199
cost of attackers

427
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,439
but it might not work for people people

428
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,480
might be sent

429
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,679
to more extreme communities

430
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,959
might coordinate better these

431
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,720
communities are moderated

432
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,439
and then they might come back and carry

433
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,720
out

434
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,640
more effective attacks against um

435
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
mainstream communities like twitter or

436
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
mainstream services like zou so this is

437
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,080
something we need to keep in mind

438
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,400
and more work is needed for this

439
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
so to conclude i showed you

440
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
that looking at cross platform activity

441
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,880
can help

442
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,919
identify raids early and even identify

443
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,919
typical traits of videos that will be

444
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,240
attacked which can then be used

445
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,280
to develop proactive moderations

446
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,520
i showed you that the defense mechanisms

447
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,960
we are using

448
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,679
against zoom bombing may be misguided

449
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,440
because they do not protect against

450
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
insiders so we need to think about

451
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,799
something else

452
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,400
and i also argue that we always need to

453
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
keep in mind

454
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,360
that suspending accounts might have

455
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,200
unwanted consequences and we need to

456
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,799
keep that in mind and

457
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,559
design our mitigations considering

458
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,160
the effects that the platforming can

459
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
have

460
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
and with this i thank you and i'm open

461
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,840
to questions

462
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,280
you
