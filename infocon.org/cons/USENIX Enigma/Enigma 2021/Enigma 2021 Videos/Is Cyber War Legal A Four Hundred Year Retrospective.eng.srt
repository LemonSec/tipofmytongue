00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,160
hi

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
my name is scott shapiro and i'm

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,360
delighted to be at

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,279
enigma 2021 talking to you about

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,600
is cyberwar legal a 400-year

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,920
retrospective imagine

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,599
you wake up tomorrow morning you reach

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,439
for your phone you open twitter

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,279
and you find out that hackers have taken

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,719
down pentagon's military networks

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,719
new tweets start to appear in your

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,520
timeline hackers have triggered

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,239
explosions at oil refineries all around

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,200
the country

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,040
they're releasing chlorine gas from

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,559
chemical plants

17
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,879
they've grounded all airplanes by

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,399
disabling air traffic

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,760
control then at noon find out that the

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,000
new york stock exchange has been hit

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
and all trading has ceased even worse

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,680
the trading records

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,399
and their backups have been altered by

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:00,879
dinner

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,559
they have plunged the entire country

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,000
into darkness

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,439
by disabling the power grid

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,080
at midnight iran claims responsibility

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,119
for these attacks

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,000
as retaliation for the econom for the

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,159
crippling economic sanctions

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,799
levied on their country by the united

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,920
states

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
now the question i would like to

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
consider is

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
would these attacks be legal would iran

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,200
have violated the laws of war

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,560
in compromising u.s digital networks

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,119
now there's no question that it would

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:35,600
have been

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
illegal for iran to bomb u.s power

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,079
plants chemical

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,119
factories stock exchanges as we'll soon

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:43,680
see

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,759
traditional war which is often called

46
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,000
kinetic war

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,680
is illegal both according to

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
international law u.s domestic law

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,560
and the domestic law of most states

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
kinetic war was outlawed in 1928

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,399
but cyber war obviously did not exist in

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,159
1928.

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,280
so what i would like to know is did the

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,240
outlaw re

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,878
of kinetic war outlaw cyber war as well

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,599
that's the question i'd like to talk

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,200
with you today

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,599
but before i do so i want to take you on

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,760
a seven minute tour

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,080
of the rite of war over the last four

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
centuries and what i'm going to do is

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,160
i'm going to

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,959
divide the survey into two parts from

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,280
1600 to 1928

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,239
what i will call the old world order and

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,920
from 1928

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,160
to the present what i will call the new

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,800
world order

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
so let us begin in 1625

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
way before the advent of cyber

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,640
attacks with the dutch humanist

72
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,680
and lawyer hugo groces the so-called

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,239
father

74
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
of international law who set out a

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,519
theory of war

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,400
which would become the orthodoxy around

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,280
the world

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
for the next 300 years according to

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,280
gracias

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,680
war is a legitimate way for states to

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,720
remedy wrongs

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,000
done to them groceries did not reserve

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,879
war

84
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,599
simply for cases of self defense alone

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,840
to repel

86
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,800
invasions or attempted conquests

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,599
he thought that states could go to war

88
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,239
for any

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,159
legal violation whatsoever so to

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,480
collect for damages done to property

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
to collect debts to resolve

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
dynastic disputes to

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
[Music]

94
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,840
deal with violations of treaties

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,959
collect stolen property

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,080
protect freedom of the seas and even

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
to punish crimes any legal wrong was a

98
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,560
kaza spelling

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,760
a legal cause of war for centuries

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,480
kinetic war was the legitimate way that

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,238
states resolved their disputes

102
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,879
war in other words in other words was

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,680
legal

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
legalism last resort after all

105
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,519
negotiations have failed

106
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,840
but legal nonetheless going to war was

107
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
like going to court

108
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,478
but instead of beating the other side an

109
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,600
argument

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
you tried to beat the other side to

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,520
death

112
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
now the legality of kinetic war had many

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,919
legal implications and i'm just going to

114
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,680
talk very briefly about two of them

115
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,280
the right of conquest and the

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,560
prohibition on economic sanctions

117
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,759
first the legal right of conquest

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,240
if the state had the legal right to wage

119
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,120
war in order to correct legal wrongs

120
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,600
then the law also needed to give states

121
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
rights to keep

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
what it took other words otherwise the

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,639
war would

124
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,600
not be serving its purpose so the united

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,080
states

126
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
went to war with mexico in 1846 and

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,080
conquered 500

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,320
000 square miles of mexican territory in

129
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,880
1847 1948

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,759
and it justified that because it was

131
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,400
collecting

132
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,240
four million dollars in deaths that

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,800
mexico owed the united states which in

134
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,639
fact did

135
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,120
conquering going to war and conquering

136
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
land

137
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,080
was our standard thing to do in the old

138
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,160
world order as shocking as it may seem

139
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
to us today

140
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
the second implication of states having

141
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,600
the legal right of war

142
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
is that economic sanctions by neutral

143
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
states on belligerents

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,479
were illegal that is if a neutral

145
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
favored one belligerent over another

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,360
giving it favorable training terms for

147
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,479
example

148
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,600
that would be an act of war because it

149
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
would be interfering

150
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
with the belligerents with the

151
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
disadvantaged states

152
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,919
right to wage war with the other

153
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,120
belligerent

154
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
what we take to be completely

155
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
uncontroversial refusing to trade with

156
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,919
another country because it started

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,319
war was illegal for much of modern

158
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,520
history so therefore

159
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
when great britain and france

160
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,520
uh were waging war against each other in

161
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,199
the late 18th century the united states

162
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,400
had to decide

163
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,000
whether to help france

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,199
repayment for its help during uh the

165
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,680
revolutionary war they want to give

166
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,600
favorable training terms and forgive

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,199
legal debts the cabinet

168
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,319
ultimately decided that to favor france

169
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,000
over great britain would be an act of

170
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,880
war

171
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,960
and would be legally perilous and

172
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,560
decided not to

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,759
if you have ever seen

174
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
hamilton or listen to the soundtrack

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
this is the issue

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,919
in the in cabinet battle 2

177
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,039
the question of whether economic

178
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,000
sanctions

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
would be a form would be an act of war

180
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,599
so just to recap in the old world order

181
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,880
war was legal

182
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,560
economic sanctions by neutrals illegal

183
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
and this will all change it changes in

184
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
1928

185
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,680
on august 27 1928 the leaders of the

186
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
great nations assembled in paris

187
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,560
to outlaw war in a treaty

188
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,800
often called the kellogg brand pact

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,840
kellogg after

190
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
the sec american secretary of state

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,599
frank kellogg and brielle

192
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,960
ashley brown the french foreign minister

193
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,400
who uh both who organized

194
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,280
and coordinated the effort and the

195
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,400
calgary impact

196
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
overturned the grocery theory of the

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,759
legitimacy of war

198
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,880
as a way of resolving disputes whereas

199
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,000
war had been

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
the main enforcement mechanisms that

201
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
states use in the old world order the

202
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,160
kellogg-briand fact outlawed it

203
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,960
states would no longer be able to resort

204
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
to force

205
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,599
in order to enforce the rights always

206
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,199
with the exception of self-defense

207
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,440
states always retain the right

208
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,120
to repel imminent or

209
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,479
actual attacks so the

210
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,520
article one of the caliber impacts

211
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,879
very very short the calgary impact um

212
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,280
in the the main articles article one the

213
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
high contracting parties condemn

214
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
recourse to war

215
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,840
for the solution of international

216
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,080
controversies and renounce it as an

217
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
instrument of national policy

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
in their relations with one another

219
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
this outlaw re of war

220
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,599
is embodied in the united nations

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,440
charter

222
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,479
ratified the united states in

223
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,399
uh 1945 uh in article 2 4

224
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,040
which states that all members shall

225
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,480
refrain from the threat of their use of

226
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
force

227
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,560
now the outlaw ray of war

228
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,760
in the old world order

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,200
dramatically changed it it

230
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,399
affected how all the other legal rights

231
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,680
were treated so in the new world order

232
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,720
with the outlawy of war

233
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
being operative all the legal rights

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
have to shift around it let me just talk

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,680
very

236
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
briefly about the two i talked before

237
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
conquest and economic sanctions

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
so in 1931 when japan

239
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,000
invaded manchuria virtually no state

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
would recognize the conquest because

241
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,440
after all

242
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,680
they had all signed the calgary impact

243
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,040
removing the legal

244
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,480
right of war so as before in the old

245
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,600
world order

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
states have a legal right of conquest in

247
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,519
the new world order there was no longer

248
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,279
a right of conquest

249
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,519
similarly whereas before in the old

250
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
world order economic sanctions were

251
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,560
illegal

252
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,640
in the new world order economic

253
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
sanctions are legal

254
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,000
if economic sanctions are the main way

255
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,320
in fact the states have for enforcing

256
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,279
their rights

257
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,560
against one another

258
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
so now i would like to return to the

259
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,640
main question of my talk

260
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,800
how do cyber attacks fit into the new

261
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,760
world order

262
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
and its out glory of war

263
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,120
to address this question i'd like to

264
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,040
pose another question

265
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
which i think is central to resolving it

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
which is are

267
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,959
cyber attacks more like kinetic war in

268
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,040
which case they would be illegal

269
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
or more like economic sanctions in which

270
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,399
case they would be

271
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,680
legal now to answer that question

272
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,959
i want to ask why are kinetic war why is

273
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:41,680
kinetic war

274
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,440
illegal well you can think of two

275
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
reasons one is that

276
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,880
kinetic war is normally extremely

277
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,000
violent there's

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
normally great death and destruction

279
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
and this is an evil that states were

280
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,320
keen to eliminate and secondly

281
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,040
kinetic war is the active harming of one

282
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,160
state

283
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,399
to another one state attacks bombs

284
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,000
invades and other states active harmony

285
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,040
by contrast economic sanctions are legal

286
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,079
because they're non-violent

287
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,240
and they are a form of passive harming

288
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,079
by passive harming what i mean is

289
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,680
what the state instead of doing

290
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
something to another state like in

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
kinetic war

292
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,240
when a state imposes economic sanctions

293
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,200
it is merely

294
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
refusing to do something with another

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,680
state so instead of doing something to

296
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,720
another state

297
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,839
the state is simply refusing to

298
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,040
cooperate with

299
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,320
another state or states so what we can

300
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,839
do is we can take

301
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,600
these these two reasons and we can

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
create a two by two matrix where the

303
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
rows are violent versus non-violent

304
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
attacks

305
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,920
and the columns are active versus

306
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,000
passive and we can see

307
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,120
that kinetic war is illegal

308
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,639
because it's in the top hand corner

309
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,920
kinetic war is both violent and

310
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,360
active whereas economic sanctions are

311
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,639
non-violent and passive let's now move

312
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,200
on

313
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,480
to cyber attacks

314
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,440
how do they fit into the matrix well

315
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,399
once we

316
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,880
try to fit cyber attacks into this

317
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
matrix we see that the reason why

318
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,600
it's been so difficult to analyze cyber

319
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,519
attacks is that

320
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,959
they don't neatly fall into either

321
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,639
top hand left top left or bottom right

322
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,800
but populate all four cells

323
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,800
of the matrix let's take the easy cases

324
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,600
first consider cyber attacks that have

325
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,720
the same effects as kinetic war

326
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,040
if iran were to blow up chemical plants

327
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,800
by exploiting vulnerabilities in

328
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,639
industrial control systems

329
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,399
these attacks would satisfy the same

330
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,079
conditions that make

331
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,880
kinetic war illegal they would be

332
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,839
violent

333
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,680
and active they would go in the top

334
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,160
left-hand corner take another easy case

335
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,079
suppose the united states decided to

336
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,200
erect a giant

337
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
internet firewall and prevent any

338
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
packets coming from iran

339
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,240
from entering the country's digital

340
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,120
networks

341
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
this too would be straightforward

342
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,279
legally speaking because the firewall

343
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,600
would

344
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,720
block simply block incoming packets

345
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
it would be non-violent and because it

346
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
would be a refusal to interact with

347
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,560
another country

348
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,000
it would be passive hence the firewall

349
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,480
would be akin to economic sanctions

350
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,399
and hence legal so top left hand

351
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,639
is red because it's active and violent

352
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,920
bottom left and right hand is blue

353
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,120
because it is passive

354
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,079
and non-violent now questions about the

355
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,920
legality of cyberwar are different

356
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,000
are difficult as i suggested before

357
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
because the legal framework for

358
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,399
analyzing

359
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,279
war was developed during the world wars

360
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,800
when kinetic war was on

361
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,600
everyone's mind that is where violence

362
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,040
and active harming

363
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,800
went hand in hand but cyber attacks

364
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,040
often pry these condition to conditions

365
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,160
apart

366
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
cyber attacks are often non-violent and

367
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,519
some

368
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,800
are passive so how should we think about

369
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,320
them

370
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
now i would suggest that we not think

371
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,440
about them in terms of the laws of war

372
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,839
that is it the cyber operations in the

373
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,519
top left and the bottom right

374
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,959
they can be analyzed according to the

375
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,360
laws of war

376
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,560
however the ones on the bottom left and

377
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
the top right the anomalous cases the

378
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,839
hybrid cases

379
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,760
they should not be analyzed according to

380
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,360
the laws of war which were developed

381
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,720
with kinetic war

382
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,399
in mind does that mean that

383
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,560
that the law has nothing to say about

384
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,199
them well i would suggest that

385
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,959
in fact there are norms central norms of

386
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,480
international law

387
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
which uh can regulate these hybrid cases

388
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,920
uh in particular the norm of

389
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
non-interference states are committed

390
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
not to interfere with the

391
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,959
internal affairs of each other's uh

392
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,480
domestic operations

393
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,000
so for example when the united states

394
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,040
fomented a coup against uh muhammad

395
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,959
muhammad mustac in 1953

396
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,600
to install the shah of iran the united

397
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
states was

398
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
violating the norm of non-interference

399
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,199
in iran's

400
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,959
domestic affairs and when vladimir putin

401
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,639
orchestrated approved the

402
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,959
attacks on the dnc in

403
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,800
2016 the russian federation was

404
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,639
violating norms of non-interference

405
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,360
against the united states

406
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,519
so the suggestion is that cyber attacks

407
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,279
that interfere with essential government

408
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,240
functions

409
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,639
violate the norm of non-interference and

410
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,759
therefore illegal and what would be

411
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,920
interference with essential government

412
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,040
functions well

413
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,040
i imagine interference in elections

414
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
utilities the financial system these

415
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,079
would be

416
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,880
the types of interference which have

417
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,399
traditionally been understood

418
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,560
as being illegal under the norm of

419
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
non-interference

420
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,959
now you may say well all that's all well

421
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,880
and good but how would we enforce this

422
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,600
i mean after all there is no supreme

423
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,880
court of the world

424
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,240
and there is no global

425
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,519
national security agency

426
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
well i would like to suggest that we use

427
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,599
the bottom right hand corner that is the

428
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,799
denial of

429
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
other states to use one's own digital

430
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,439
networks so here would be the plan the

431
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,880
plan would be

432
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,199
to form what i call cyber clubs member

433
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,799
states would agree to certain cyber

434
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,520
norms

435
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,440
and would enforce these norms by

436
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,280
threatening to expel or reduce

437
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
access to networks to those members of

438
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,320
the club

439
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
who do not abide by the rules and those

440
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,240
members of the club

441
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,039
those non-members of the club who cannot

442
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,039
abide by certain minimal

443
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,080
obligations who can imagine

444
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,120
slowing down access reducing access and

445
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,400
in cases of repeated or or

446
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,440
um severe violations complete exclusion

447
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,760
from the network i would like to thank

448
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
uh my colleague and co-author professor

449
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,200
hathaway uh uh

450
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,039
who um helped

451
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,400
uh develop the framework for thinking

452
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,960
about

453
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,360
the history of the laws of war in a book

454
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,039
called the internationals that we

455
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,840
wrote together was published in 2017 and

456
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
who helped me think through

457
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,720
the application of this history to

458
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,320
the to cyber attacks and to professor

459
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
daniela oliveira

460
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,799
my sherpa and one of the organizers of

461
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,520
the

462
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,080
of enigma for helping me greatly

463
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:57,840
develop this talk thank you very much

464
