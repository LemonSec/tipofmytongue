1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,880
hello

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,000
enigma it's a pleasure to present here

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,520
i'm kristin fellini

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,439
an always project lead and swiss

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,560
security engineer

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
switzerland is a direct democracy where

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,680
citizens get to vote

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,160
at least four times a year this

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,119
frequency

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,840
and the dominant use of mailing ballots

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,600
make it a compelling test bet

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,719
for internet voting switzerland

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,760
has a 20 years history with online or

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,640
internet voting with many ups and downs

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,200
and i'm going to tell you that story

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,680
the last chapter of this tale is going

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,199
to cover a report

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,840
based on an extensive dialogue with 25

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,800
scientists

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,079
and voting experts but

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,399
before we dive right in let's get

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,239
something straight

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,479
i'm talking about switzerland here it's

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,080
not the same as sweden despite the

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,159
similar sound of the name

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,479
sweden has the moose and the vikings

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,840
while we have the cheese and the

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,960
chocolate

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
cheese and chocolate are so deep in our

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,240
national dna

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
it's probably written somewhere in our

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
constitution in fact

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,439
a lot of things are written in our

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,200
constitution because

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,280
we vote on individual passages of the

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,320
constitution

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,680
several times a year since this is such

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
a regular process

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,280
the country has streamlined it a big

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
deal and these days

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
90 of the people vote by mail and of

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,159
course

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,560
we also elect our parliament mostly by

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
submitting paper bullets

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,720
via swiss post or placing them in a

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,920
public mailbox

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,560
up to four weeks ahead of the vote or

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,479
election

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,960
there are several security risks

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,520
involved in this remote voting practice

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,439
but they're kind of accepted where i

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,759
come from and it's only lately

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,000
that research like the threat model on

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,960
this slide

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,840
started to take a closer look don't try

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,439
to read a small font here

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,119
but look up the paper if you're

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,760
interested it explains the many many

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,800
shortcomings

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,800
of the process and the dozens of

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
auxiliary electronic systems

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,239
that have been introduced during the

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,920
last 20-30 years

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
without ever discussing the security

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,720
implications that they bring

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
but voting and especially electing by

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
hand is also very complicated in

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,319
switzerland

69
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,800
funny enough you can edit election

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,000
ballots heavily

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
and still submit them for tallying like

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,120
the one on this slide

73
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,200
following the american presidential

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,519
election i got the impression

75
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
a large p a lot of people do not trust

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
mailing ballots very much i have no

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,959
doubt

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,879
that large numbers of ballots submitted

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
online would make this conflict

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,560
even worse so it's very easy to argue

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,040
that internet voting is a stupid and

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,680
outright

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,280
dangerous idea here is bruce schneier's

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,879
take on the topic

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,040
we simply can't build an internet voting

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,519
system that is secure against hacking

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,159
because of the requirement for a secret

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,680
ballot

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
this argument is based on the

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
technological difficulties

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
down in the encryption it is a

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
compelling argument

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
as are many others that are regularly

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,560
brought forward

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,840
against internet voting but

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,159
perhaps surprisingly there are also

97
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,159
strong arguments in favor of internet

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,440
voting

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,640
here are the ones that apply in

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,519
switzerland swiss expats

101
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,959
make up 10 of the swiss citizens

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,480
they are allowed to vote at home in

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
switzerland and they vote by mail

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,879
needless to say that in a lot of

105
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,560
countries mail just

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,439
doesn't work very reliably so these

107
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,400
expats

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,319
regularly fail to return their ballots

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,760
in time

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,239
and given we vote at least four times a

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,120
year

112
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,680
we cannot possibly call them to visit

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,720
the embassy

114
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,080
in the capital of their place to place

115
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,519
their ballot

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,599
these foreign nationals are effectively

117
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,720
disfranchised

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,160
from the vote people with severe visual

119
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,120
handicaps

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,199
as well as quadripletics cannot vote

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,600
without assistance

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
it is likely to be around one percent of

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
the voting population

124
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,040
that need to rely on an assistance

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
because of these handicaps

126
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
they need to trust this assistant and

127
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,080
therefore

128
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
they don't receive the secret ballot

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,440
that the constitution guarantees

130
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
with the complex options to tinker with

131
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,040
election ballots

132
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,800
it is not surprising that people

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
regularly produce invalid ballots

134
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
namely in elections some jurisdictions

135
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,520
count more than 10

136
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,479
of invalid ballots with any given

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,440
democracy

138
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,479
too many invalid ballots undermine the

139
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,240
value of the result

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,320
so it is an advantage of internet voting

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,520
that it produces

142
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,800
formally correct balance and finally

143
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
the security problems of the physical

144
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,039
voting process itself

145
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,520
it is true that the physical voting in

146
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
the voting office

147
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,360
is very well protected namely when you

148
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
compare with your inherently in

149
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,160
unsupervised mailing ballots but lacks

150
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
regulation

151
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,400
bad local practices and potentially very

152
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
skilled attackers

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
make an attack on the physical voting

154
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,960
process a real possibility

155
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
this is especially the case with all the

156
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,039
electronic systems

157
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
that have been introduced to simplify

158
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,520
the handling of votes and elections

159
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,919
discussions around internet voting all

160
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,919
to shed some light on this problem

161
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,840
that was mostly ignored before that

162
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,759
very much like the united states

163
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,680
switzerland has organized

164
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,320
in a federal way the individual states

165
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,560
have a strong autonomy over large areas

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
of politics

167
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,039
and voting is such an area the states

168
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,000
or cantons as we call them have almost

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,759
complete authority over votes and

170
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,280
elections

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,919
so the situation is very much like

172
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,520
united states

173
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,880
it's just that delaware will compete to

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,199
be

175
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,319
the largest swiss canton

176
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,039
there is one exception to this state or

177
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
province authority over votes in

178
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
elections though

179
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
the law that allows for internet voting

180
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,680
tests

181
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,039
this law assigns the federal

182
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,600
administration the authority to regulate

183
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,479
internet voting namely in terms of

184
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,600
security

185
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,680
i think there was a very smart move 20

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,080
years back

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
several swiss cantons started to

188
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
experiment with internet voting

189
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,639
after the year 2000. the federal

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,680
administration

191
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
accompanied them but didn't interfere

192
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,720
very much

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
during the first few years it left the

194
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:53,840
cantons

195
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,880
enough space to experiment a leading

196
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,440
role

197
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,319
was taken by the swiss canton of geneva

198
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,240
geneva gave the world calvinism

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
and he played an important role in the

200
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
age of enlightenment

201
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,560
given this glorious past geneva saw it

202
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,919
as its historical mission

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,080
to bring internet voting to switzerland

204
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,919
and perhaps the world

205
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
despite several drawbacks and the need

206
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,759
to start over from scratch more than

207
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,720
once

208
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
geneva has been persistent in the

209
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,039
development of a purely swiss internet

210
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,319
voting system

211
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,400
there is also fully open source and is

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,199
later implementations

213
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,039
another big player was a group of eight

214
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,800
cantons who commissioned

215
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,720
an internet voting system with the local

216
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,039
branch of american unisys

217
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
that system was successfully used in

218
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,319
dozens of national votes

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,160
by thousands of swiss citizens living

220
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,759
abroad

221
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
in 2011 a national steering board for

222
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,039
internet voting was established

223
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,039
and it moved to rein in the systems and

224
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,639
regulate them in a clear way

225
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,360
the positive outlook changed somewhat in

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
2015

227
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
when the federal administration reviewed

228
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,160
the security architecture

229
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,479
of the unisys system and consequently

230
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,080
barred it from being used in federal

231
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
elections of 2015.

232
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
this came out of the blue for several of

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,039
the cantons in an equally surprising

234
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:13,599
move

235
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,680
they abandoned ship and the eunice's

236
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,479
system died a sudden death

237
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,879
geneva was allowed to run the 2015

238
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,759
elections

239
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,720
as of a spanish company's cycle who had

240
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,280
formed

241
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,160
a joint venture with swiss post in the

242
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
years that followed

243
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
internet voting was used to transmit

244
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,599
around two percent of the votes

245
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,159
but over 90 of the voters use paper mail

246
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,399
the federal administration defined

247
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
universal verifiability

248
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
as a key characteristic of the future

249
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,360
voting system

250
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
and wrote that into the regulation it

251
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,839
saw the remaining problems

252
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,640
of a mostly administrative nature so it

253
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,000
called for swiss cantons to

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,440
embrace online voting now in an infamous

255
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,160
message

256
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
the federal chancellor called for

257
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,240
internet voting being offered

258
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,120
by two two thirds of the cantons for

259
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
2019 national elections

260
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
in the same media conference the

261
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,279
chancellor announced a commission

262
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,360
that would write a report on the topic

263
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
and the general readiness

264
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,760
of the technologies for a wide adoption

265
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,839
the commission was an assembly of

266
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,440
administrative voting experts and

267
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
several lawyers

268
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
cryptographers and computer scientists

269
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
were substantially underrepresented

270
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
and not surprisingly the commission

271
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,839
reported that internet voting was solved

272
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,519
as a problem

273
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,360
they called for whitsbred adoption and

274
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
the unilateral orientation

275
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
of the commission was a wake-up call for

276
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,839
critics of internet roading

277
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,519
they rallied their lines and began to

278
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,959
oppose the introduction of internet

279
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,839
voting

280
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,920
ultimately collecting signatures to

281
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
force a public vote

282
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,640
on the question meanwhile geneva and

283
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
recital swiss post-joint venture

284
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,680
implemented the universal verifiability

285
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
and they entered a fierce competition

286
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
since it looked as if the cake would be

287
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
cut up by 2019

288
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,839
a doll had an aura of speed and fear of

289
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,200
missing out

290
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,320
yet implementing universal verifiability

291
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
proved to be really expensive and when

292
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,640
the political consolation changed in

293
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,519
geneva

294
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,680
the financial and political backing was

295
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
no longer given

296
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
and the canton through the towel after

297
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,600
15 years of development

298
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
the road was thus free for swiss pose to

299
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
become the dominant player

300
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
for the national election of 2019

301
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,560
swiss post had obtained a positive 400

302
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,800
pages report from kpmg

303
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,560
and several university professors

304
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,720
confirmed the cycle internet voting

305
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,519
protocol

306
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,399
did what he meant to do the protocol

307
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,440
that is

308
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,040
not necessarily the source code

309
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
as a final step before the federal

310
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,640
permit for general use in votes and

311
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,519
elections

312
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
swiss post was formally obliged to

313
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,200
publish the code

314
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,240
of its closed source cycle system

315
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
the publication happened in february

316
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,279
2019

317
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,600
and it took but a few days for the first

318
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,200
fatal vulnerability to be published

319
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
when there was a second and a third

320
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,480
critical vulnerability

321
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
the system lost most of the public

322
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
confidence that swiss post had groomed

323
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,079
over the course of several years

324
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,680
and the system had to be stopped again

325
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
only month before the national election

326
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,760
so instead of two-thirds of the cantons

327
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
offering internet voting

328
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
it was zero campaigns for the national

329
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
elections

330
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,200
for many people involved this was a

331
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,839
traumatic experience

332
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
after the crash of the remaining system

333
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,680
in 2019

334
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
it was clear that the process had to be

335
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
rebooted if internet voting was meant to

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
make a comeback

337
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,320
i credit the stakeholders with realizing

338
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,279
quickly

339
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,760
that it wasn't opening the system that

340
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,160
killed internet voting

341
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,120
no it was the lack of transparency that

342
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
allowed swiss posts getting so

343
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
far without inherent defects being

344
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,800
detected

345
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
so there is a need for early public

346
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
scrutiny and it's also pretty clear

347
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
that internet voting is not a problem

348
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,560
solved

349
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,440
instead the task force agreed to bring

350
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,800
in top scientists

351
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,560
to see if it was solvable at all

352
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,680
the task force invited 25 scientists

353
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,000
and industry experts to participate in a

354
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,120
frank dialect

355
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,160
on internet voting naturally several of

356
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
the scientists came from the world

357
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,720
leading swiss

358
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,760
technical universities eth in zurich

359
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,959
and epf in lausanne yet also

360
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,200
vanessa teague and olivier pereira

361
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,320
participated

362
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,160
after having discovered several

363
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
weaknesses in the swiss post voting

364
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,720
system

365
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,079
the scientists were invited to fill out

366
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:50,800
a survey

367
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,760
the two questions on cryptography source

368
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,959
code development

369
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,200
risk management reliable printing

370
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,320
forensics

371
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,279
you name it in a second stage the

372
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,800
scientists would be invited

373
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
to attend three on-site workshops the

374
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
results of the survey would be discussed

375
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,079
namely in areas where no consensus was

376
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,120
visible

377
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,639
so these open questions will be

378
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,560
discussed in order to update the federal

379
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,760
regulation

380
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
in a third and final stage of the

381
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,839
rebooting process

382
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,680
planning these workshops the federal

383
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,519
administration invited me to moderate

384
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,240
them

385
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,800
in fact the phone call that sealed the

386
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,440
deal happened on a sunday morning at 5am

387
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
after i had landed in california to

388
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,839
attend enigma

389
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,760
2020. but right when we wanted to

390
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,040
schedule the workshops

391
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,279
the pandemic hit and on-site workshops

392
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,720
became a no-go

393
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
so we decided to discuss around 50

394
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
questions on a dedicated internet

395
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,440
platform

396
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
in the form of gitlab issues over the

397
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
course of 12 weeks

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,079
given the scientists involved it comes

399
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,120
as no surprise

400
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,760
that cryptography voting protocols and

401
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,279
software development were the topics

402
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,360
with the hottest debates

403
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
here we were really able to draw up on

404
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,680
an immense body of knowledge

405
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,079
other areas administrative risk

406
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,279
management

407
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,519
statistics questions around political

408
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,800
signs etc

409
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,639
were much thinner and attracted less

410
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,320
statements

411
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,199
all in all we saw around 700 individual

412
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,959
statements on the platform

413
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,480
a number that includes my moderation

414
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,399
i think it important to highlight the

415
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,480
fact that we reach consensus

416
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
in almost all of the topics discussed

417
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
and also that there was very little

418
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,279
political pressure one way or the other

419
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,160
the result is just a summary of the 62

420
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,279
survey questions

421
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,440
and a consensus position on the 50

422
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
questions posed on the platform

423
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
this was all fortunate to report that

424
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
the federal administration published in

425
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,480
english

426
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,360
in november 2020 for some of the

427
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,160
questions

428
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,920
the plaintiff was not the right body to

429
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,000
discuss something in detail

430
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,079
therefore the federal administration

431
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,240
commissioned separate reports from

432
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,600
individual scientists

433
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,560
on specific topics the viability of a

434
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,760
particular form

435
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,240
of a public built-in board with such a

436
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,880
topic

437
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
or the feasibility of cross-channel

438
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,920
plausibility checks

439
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,120
on the results while these complementary

440
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
reports were being finished

441
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
the task force moved to discuss the

442
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,399
response and recommendations

443
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,720
by the scientist and write into a more

444
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
political report

445
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,240
that he published in december this

446
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,959
report

447
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,800
attempts to strike a balance between the

448
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,160
scientific advice

449
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
and the political stakeholders it is not

450
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
the new regulation yet

451
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,000
but it gives a good idea where this is

452
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,079
going and i was pleased to see

453
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,079
that this more political report is

454
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,279
pretty much in line with the

455
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,920
recommendations by the scientists

456
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,440
but let's turn back the scientist's

457
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,360
report and look at some of its key

458
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
recommendations

459
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
here is the front page and the table of

460
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,800
contents

461
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,199
don't try to read it it's much as small

462
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,839
but please download it from the website

463
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,320
the scientists conclude that switzerland

464
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,519
has come a long way

465
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,519
with its endeavour to introduce internet

466
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,639
voting

467
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,560
the structure with the cantons on the

468
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,120
state level advancing their systems and

469
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,639
the federal administration

470
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,440
executing regulatory oversight is seen

471
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,639
to be working

472
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,120
yet the scientists see a need to adjust

473
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,320
the regulation as well

474
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,759
perhaps in a continuous way

475
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,320
looking forward 15 years several

476
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
scientists expect internet voting to be

477
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,440
established by then

478
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
with the electorate having confidence

479
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,040
that the voting system produces the

480
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,639
correct results

481
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,720
for other experts in the group this

482
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,639
moment is probably further away

483
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,360
or they were unsure if internet voting

484
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,440
will ever earn the trust necessary

485
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,399
for being established

486
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,639
an important recommendation dealt with

487
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,560
the specifications of the protocol

488
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,360
and its implementation it defines there

489
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
there have to be several layers of

490
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,320
specifications

491
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,399
from the top protocol down to the source

492
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,160
code of the system

493
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,720
the top specification of the protocol i

494
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,560
am quoting the report here

495
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,639
the top specification of the protocol

496
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,240
has to be a verifier model

497
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,000
that is abstract enough to allow

498
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
reasoning about it

499
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,480
furthermore there has to be a refinement

500
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,439
relationship

501
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,880
between the different levels of

502
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,439
specification down to the pseudocode

503
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,240
and eventually the code level all the

504
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,199
recommendations

505
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,679
that affect cryptography was the use of

506
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,720
formal methods

507
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
as well as static and dynamic analysis

508
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,079
for the protocol

509
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,280
and the code of course there was a

510
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,039
strong call for diversity

511
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,039
as a means to bring resilience to the

512
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,280
system so it could resist attacks

513
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
and guarantee the secrecy of the vote

514
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,160
and the correctness of the result

515
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
in the survey phase of the dialogue

516
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,520
individual participants

517
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
expressed concerns with adding different

518
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,559
hardware types

519
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
with running a variety of operation

520
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,840
system families

521
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,000
with multiple implementations of the

522
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,080
software in different languages

523
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,720
compiled on different compilers they

524
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,080
mention complexity

525
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240
and integration costs as limiting

526
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,520
factors

527
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,840
however when discussing the question on

528
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,120
the gitlab platform

529
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,919
these concerns were quickly addressed

530
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,400
and they imploded in the discussion

531
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
the key winning argument was the

532
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
following

533
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,919
diversity as costs in a fairly linear

534
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,080
way but the security benefits that the

535
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,520
diversity brings about

536
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,200
are exponential so coding security

537
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,400
is important as is hardening but

538
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
beyond a certain barrier it is better to

539
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,520
develop and run various implementations

540
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,280
of the system in parallel

541
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
according to the consensus opinion

542
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,559
transparency

543
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,799
and the free access to as much

544
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,400
information as possible

545
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,120
are key factors to allow public scrutiny

546
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,880
as a means to build confidence

547
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,679
into the system it has to be made easy

548
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,120
to access the source code

549
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
analysis documentation to install and

550
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,320
maintain the system

551
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
on one's own premises in order to run

552
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,320
test votes and elections

553
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080
reproducible builds are being mentioned

554
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,799
too it's possible to allow this island

555
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,240
to property license

556
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,480
but it's far more difficult since the

557
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,080
closed source development stands in the

558
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
way of transparency

559
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,559
i quote the report again an open source

560
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,160
license is therefore

561
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,320
very recommended for internet voting

562
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
system

563
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,000
i have explained how the federal

564
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,679
administration has authority

565
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,760
over the security of internet voting

566
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,520
despite the swiss cantons having

567
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,320
authority

568
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,880
over voting in elections the whole

569
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
dialogue was to strongly link to the

570
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,480
federal administration

571
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
that is why it has been scoped to focus

572
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
on internet voting alone

573
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,880
however several participants insisted

574
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
that electronic auxiliary systems pose a

575
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,080
systematic threat

576
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,919
to the established physical voting

577
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,919
channels they successfully slipped the

578
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,400
section

579
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,640
into report but they called for a more

580
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
holistic perspective of voting security

581
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
and an analysis of potential

582
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
cross-general attacks

583
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,600
time to wrap this up switzerland has a

584
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
long history of internet voting trials

585
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,840
we're still not in real production but

586
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,120
the development

587
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,080
is moving forward being governed by the

588
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,159
typical swiss insistence on quality over

589
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,440
speed

590
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
the fast pace of far more public votes

591
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
per year make the country

592
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,440
an ideal test bed to experiment with

593
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
internet voting in a country

594
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
that has a lot of experience with

595
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
conducting boats

596
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
both remaining active voting system

597
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,200
crashed before the national election

598
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,640
2019

599
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,960
meanwhile the process was rebooted with

600
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,480
the help of cryptographers

601
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,880
computer scientists and voting experts

602
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
the resulting report is a milestone

603
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,840
with significance that should point

604
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,120
beyond switzerland

605
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,039
regulators and administrations around

606
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,039
the world should read this report

607
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,559
if they are attempting to introduce

608
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,520
internet voting for their jurisdictions

609
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
personally i'm really torn whether

610
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,720
internet voting

611
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,440
is a good idea or not yet i see its

612
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,520
introduction as a political decision

613
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,679
and many countries are moving to set up

614
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,760
internet voting systems

615
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,280
if you are involved in any of these

616
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,120
endeavors then please go

617
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,679
and read the swiss report thank you for

618
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:16,559
your attention

619
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,639
you
