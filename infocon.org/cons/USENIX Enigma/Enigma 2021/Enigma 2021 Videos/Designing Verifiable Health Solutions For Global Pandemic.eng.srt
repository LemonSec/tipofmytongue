1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,760
hi folks

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,280
today we're going to be talking about

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
designing verifiable health solutions

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,200
for global pandemic

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
we've got a lot to cover but i'll be

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,400
trying my best to balance the high level

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,279
overview

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,880
and also the right level of technical

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,119
depth it's a pretty heated topic but i

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,880
hope everyone here at least walks away

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,560
with a slightly different perspective of

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,480
what's possible

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,720
but first my name is mark funk and i've

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,399
spent the last 15 years building

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,160
designing and reviewing things

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,840
before i started my own consulting

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,680
practice i was in full-time consulting

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,239
roles

19
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,480
at places like google and square i've

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,399
worked with a lot of teams big and small

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,200
across a

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
wide variety of problem domains helping

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
people de-risk their products

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,360
i'm going to be talking about the global

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,840
pandemic that started early last year

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,600
specifically about the u.s because

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,199
that's where i live and we've been

28
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,960
having a really bad time

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,320
certain things appear to be working

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
elsewhere that just aren't working here

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
and it's going to be a sobering topic

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
many of you watching will have lost

33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
friends and family over the last year

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
myself included the death toll and

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
damage to society has been overwhelming

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,000
so this talk is going to be centered

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,920
around a project i started in april

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
where i donated some time with a new

39
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,040
nonprofit organization

40
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,119
full of tech industry folks and health

41
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,640
policy experts

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,240
and they brought me in to imagine a new

43
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,240
privacy architecture for a pandemic

44
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,439
solution

45
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,080
for a world with tests and vaccines but

46
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
i stopped that work shortly after my

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,880
initial design

48
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,400
when it was clear i was designing

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,680
something for a world that wouldn't

50
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,240
exist for a while

51
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,520
so the theory is that you can

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
proactively prevent covet infected

53
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,520
individuals from entering the space

54
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,439
by enforcing a strict set of policies

55
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,960
around entrance

56
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,920
in contrast this with contact tracing

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,759
which is about reactively tracing

58
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,520
infected people's contacts

59
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,439
and notifying them to isolate and get

60
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,560
tested

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
i believe that containing a pandemic

62
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,759
effectively would

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,680
require strong efforts on multiple

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
fronts and while i admired the work of

65
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,759
privacy preserving contact racing

66
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,079
proposals being published at this time

67
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,000
i had reservations about how well an

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,239
opt-in system could work in the u.s

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,680
but what was compelling about this

70
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,840
project was that everything was already

71
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,560
closed

72
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
and if we built a tool that could be

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
used to reopen spaces

74
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,360
and didn't need to reach some critical

75
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,879
mass to protect people

76
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,879
then it would provide immediate benefit

77
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,280
if it could actually keep people safe

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,879
so what does it mean to check policy

79
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,879
compliance and would it keep people safe

80
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,319
so you've probably seen these health

81
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,760
questionnaires if you've gone to any

82
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,519
medical facility or other building in

83
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,480
the last year

84
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
and if you answer yes to any of them

85
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
they say you should isolate and get

86
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,640
tested

87
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,959
but it requires that you have knowledge

88
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,360
and truthfulness of your symptoms

89
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,440
which makes it largely self-attestation

90
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
and only provides weak assurances

91
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
but there are approaches with stronger

92
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,319
assurances like a viral diagnosis test

93
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
will tell you if you have a detectable

94
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,200
level of infection

95
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
that would indicate ability to pass on

96
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
the virus asymptomatic or not

97
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,120
and some countries and states already

98
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
require people to take a test one to

99
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
three days before and after traveling

100
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,159
a vaccine administered indicates

101
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,239
potential immunity and ability to pass

102
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,360
on the virus

103
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,200
with a duration of confidence that stems

104
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,879
from research clinical trials and

105
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,560
patient statistics

106
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
vaccines for other diseases are already

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
extensively required for traveling

108
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,200
abroad

109
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
enrolling kids in school and even for

110
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,879
some jobs

111
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,879
so the proposed way to make this easier

112
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,959
is by sharing data via scannable paper

113
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,040
ticket or qr code from your phone

114
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
like we're used to for air travel or

115
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,959
concerts

116
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,400
but do we need to share our medical

117
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,879
records for safety is self-attestation

118
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,400
good enough

119
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,319
the short answer is no and the reasons

120
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,519
are many

121
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,040
coveted spreads quickly across the

122
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
population and requires consistent

123
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,959
mitigation practices

124
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,120
and in the us health recommendations are

125
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,640
fairly moderate to lacks

126
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,519
and enforcement is lacks to non-existent

127
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,760
an economic inequality and poor social

128
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,480
support

129
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
have left individuals in positions where

130
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,519
they have to prioritize

131
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,560
income over their own safety and while

132
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,519
keeping

133
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,920
potentially contagious people out you

134
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,680
also need to account for certain social

135
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,720
elements

136
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,799
like many perceive a lack of symptoms as

137
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,639
not infected or transmissible

138
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
which can compromise a network of social

139
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,680
bubbles

140
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,040
and there are many people who are just

141
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
willing to take risks to continue their

142
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
normal lifestyle

143
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
or they thought it wasn't going to be a

144
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
big deal for young people

145
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
and this one's really frustrating

146
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,639
there's just people who believe

147
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
outrageous disinformation like cove is a

148
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,360
hoax

149
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,520
or that 5g antennas cause it or that

150
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,800
vaccines cause it

151
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
or that masks don't do anything so i

152
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,479
didn't think we could rely on the good

153
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,160
faith participation of members in

154
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,639
society

155
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,720
so i believe that symptom checkers had

156
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,639
weak assurances

157
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,639
while infection diagnosis and

158
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,400
vaccination records have stronger

159
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
assurances

160
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,280
they're also not trustworthy unless you

161
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,800
can prove they're yours

162
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,320
and this means that very sensitive

163
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
information might be required to do this

164
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,000
properly

165
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
so will it be worth it what's the

166
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,919
privacy risk to you

167
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,680
here's a high level technical overview

168
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
of different data architecture options

169
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,520
a centralized database is the

170
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
traditional approach for data services

171
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
and online identities

172
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,720
which ultimately requires that you trust

173
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,560
your controller to be a good custodian

174
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,000
of your sensitive data

175
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
but this likely isn't going to work with

176
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
a solution like this because even though

177
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,000
you trust

178
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
your health care provider to manage your

179
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
health records you don't want them to

180
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
know every place you check into

181
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,880
but the peer-to-peer design is pretty

182
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,520
interesting has great offline usability

183
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,120
but it's difficult to have the same

184
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,280
authenticity and privacy assurances that

185
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,759
you would with a centralized solution

186
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,680
and there's another decentralized option

187
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
referred to as self-sovereign identity

188
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,600
but it concentrates more on the online

189
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,919
identity aspect using decentralized

190
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,039
identifiers

191
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,759
data control via asymmetric cryptography

192
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,360
and publishing it somewhere publicly

193
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,960
available on the blockchain

194
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,199
or some federated solid pod and

195
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,800
frequently these proposals seem to

196
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,120
conflate data control and privacy

197
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,479
so i'm not sure if it would work for

198
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,319
these purposes

199
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,800
and they just didn't describe solutions

200
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
for exposure risks when you're

201
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
publishing sensitive information under a

202
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
pseudonym

203
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
and sharing references to untrusted

204
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
parties who might use it to correlate

205
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
your actual identity and track you over

206
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,639
time

207
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
so looking at the centralized design

208
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,319
again some east asian countries like

209
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,840
singapore have been doing really well

210
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,360
containing the pandemic

211
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
using their mandated centralized

212
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,400
solutions

213
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,319
so instead of moralizing our differences

214
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,840
and privacy ideals

215
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,720
we have to ask would it work here i

216
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,880
don't think so and i'll tell you why

217
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
it asks far too much from a country

218
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
fiercely struggling against structural

219
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,919
discrimination

220
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,000
and government surveillance it's very

221
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,919
conceivable that location data would

222
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,960
directly harm

223
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
black indigenous people of color

224
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,880
communities muslims immigrants

225
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,000
lgbtq folks and other groups

226
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
and these centralized solutions are

227
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,280
already showing their potential to be

228
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,720
used against citizens best interests

229
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
so what happens when you leave the data

230
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
sharing between individuals

231
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
well you shift the trust model

232
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
significantly cutting out a convenient

233
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
position of surveillance

234
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,160
some manual contact racing efforts took

235
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,919
the approach of sharing direct

236
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,240
personal information and folks found out

237
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,160
the hard way how decentralized threat

238
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,639
actors can also be a danger

239
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,440
in recent uh regarding public ledgers

240
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
and decentralized identifiers

241
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
if they don't change over time they will

242
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,360
be used to track your identity presence

243
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,039
and activity

244
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
so what would i do i would choose a

245
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
decentralized offline storage approach

246
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
using peer-to-peer data sharing

247
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
but i would centralize other portions to

248
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
obfuscate identity further

249
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,360
creating temporary credentials to reduce

250
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,479
tracking risk

251
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,120
and without compromising authenticity

252
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,479
and i would rely on that central

253
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,080
authority to delegate the function of

254
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,919
handling sensitive information

255
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,280
to trusted agents but would it be worth

256
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,840
it

257
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,879
who would this actually serve well

258
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
many calls to reopen have been to save

259
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,879
our economy but i would remind them our

260
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,720
economy is made of people and we should

261
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,599
instead

262
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,599
help individuals reinforce firmer

263
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,759
boundaries in their own bubbles

264
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,919
help communities protect themselves from

265
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,360
uncaring outsiders

266
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
and a world on fire help workers demand

267
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,520
safer environments from their employers

268
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,599
and help us reduce the disproportionate

269
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,280
harm it's doing to black indigenous

270
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,039
people of color communities

271
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,960
these numbers are devastating and should

272
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
shake you to the core

273
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
and if that doesn't terrify you more

274
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
than six percent of our population is

275
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,200
unemployed

276
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
and seven times that is going hungry so

277
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
staying home indefinitely

278
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,799
clearly only works when you have the

279
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,919
privilege and resources to do so

280
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,679
so let's start talking about a potential

281
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
solution

282
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
so here's a high level overview of the

283
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,560
various actors and points of trust

284
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
first there is a central authority which

285
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,320
delegates functions to trusted

286
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
individuals for creating health and

287
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
identity credentials

288
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,920
it itself creates specific credentials

289
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
i'll talk about later on

290
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,440
and it keeps a revocation database for

291
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,839
invalid keys

292
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,080
identity verifiers are trusted agents

293
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
like county officials employers

294
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
school administrators and they can

295
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,640
provide certified proofs of a valid type

296
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,360
of id being tied to a user's device

297
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
they are also responsible for tracking

298
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,560
the number of registration attempts

299
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,399
health workers are trusted agents who

300
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,399
with access to patient health data

301
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
can provide certified proofs of viral

302
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,680
tests or vaccines administered

303
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,839
policy administrators are also trusted

304
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
agents like federal state county

305
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,720
officials

306
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,120
or employers school administrators and

307
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
even private business owners

308
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,560
they're the ones who publish policy

309
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,040
requirements for their area of authority

310
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
and their authority is hierarchical only

311
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,480
allowing them to set stricter

312
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
requirements than their county

313
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,360
or state allows policy checkers are

314
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,880
untrusted agents who check

315
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,640
individuals credentials for policy

316
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
compliance but these could also be

317
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,839
machines controlling a door entry system

318
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,600
individuals are just people seeking

319
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
entrance to shared spaces

320
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,959
who must prove their health policy

321
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,640
compliance to do so

322
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,920
so what do health policies look like

323
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,079
these aren't actual recommendations but

324
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,760
just showcasing the different policy

325
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
capabilities

326
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,720
state state-level policies can even be

327
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
defined on building code occupancy type

328
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,519
like schools offices elder care

329
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,880
facilities

330
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,480
and spaces and their policies are

331
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,040
published so individuals using the app

332
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,399
can find out whether they meet the

333
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,240
requirements ahead of time

334
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,000
additionally standard policy

335
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,279
recommendations

336
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
could be available for individuals use

337
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
within their own bubbles

338
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,440
but there's also a lot of educational

339
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,720
opportunities

340
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
policy admins can create soft

341
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,000
requirements that can't be technically

342
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,880
validated

343
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,279
but serve as useful guidelines like must

344
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,800
wear a surgical mask

345
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,680
no cloth or valve masks must keep 10

346
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,880
feet of distance

347
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,200
or must not admit more than 12 people at

348
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,320
a time

349
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,480
if a place requires a test or a vaccine

350
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,240
and the individual doesn't have one

351
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,920
that's also an opportunity to help them

352
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,600
find the nearest clinic and schedule a

353
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,360
visit

354
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
so let's start talking about the

355
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,200
protocol itself it's critical to not

356
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
require an online identity

357
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,399
since tracking movements in the real

358
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,839
world poses too dangerous as

359
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,279
surveillance risk

360
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,720
we'll rely on some pretty boring

361
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
asymmetric cryptography to produce

362
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,920
trustworthy proofs

363
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,640
and minimize data exposure requirements

364
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,399
we'll also prohibit using static

365
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,720
identifiers or fingerprintable data

366
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
when checking into a location to prevent

367
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
others from correlating your identity

368
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,160
and other information over time

369
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,079
from an interactive proof perspective

370
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,839
individuals are the provers and they

371
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
make requests to verifiers

372
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
to validate their credentials and

373
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
receive useful proofs in response

374
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,680
the transport mechanism is not strictly

375
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,959
tied to qr codes

376
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,880
but it works over the network as well

377
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
and they can even be printed out on

378
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,920
paper by trusted agents

379
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,680
with some known risk trade-offs around

380
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,480
having a longer expiry period

381
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,399
the interaction is a two-step request

382
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,040
response and in the request the interact

383
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,279
the assertion object contains

384
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
information that requires verification

385
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,079
but is to be kept off the record and the

386
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
prover object contains a public key

387
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
uniquely generated for the interaction

388
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,079
and in the response there's the trusted

389
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,920
verifiers signed public key

390
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,240
the prover object from step 1 and the

391
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
outcome object which should never

392
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
contain personally identifiable

393
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,160
information

394
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,240
but may gener may have general

395
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,079
information like vaccine type

396
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,399
and date administered and you can later

397
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,760
prove ownership of this proof by

398
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
presenting it along with a new signature

399
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
with that same interaction key pair

400
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,399
glossing over the details here's a more

401
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,160
approachable high-level summary

402
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
it's how individuals make a request to

403
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,639
healthcare workers or identity verifiers

404
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,399
in order to acquire the proof they need

405
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,120
to meet policy requirements

406
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,880
on the other side of that transaction

407
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
this is the response you get back

408
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,639
and remember you can prove ownership of

409
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,800
it by presenting it along with this

410
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
a new signature and the same interaction

411
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,160
key pair

412
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,839
this is an important part of the

413
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,519
pseudonymization strategy

414
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,800
because it allows you to claim this

415
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,880
voucher as yours without exposing new

416
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,279
personal data

417
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,120
so let's explore the purpose of identity

418
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
verification

419
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,639
its intention is to make it costly to

420
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,639
construct fraudulent or multiple

421
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,839
identities

422
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
the safety risk mitigation is about

423
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
discouraging users from attempting to

424
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
reset their health status

425
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
when they should be isolating and it's

426
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,279
technically possible to inject code to

427
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,279
subvert cryptographic functions

428
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,959
which allow you to change the photo and

429
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,560
give your phone to someone else

430
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
or extract your private keys to transfer

431
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,880
to a cloned version of the app

432
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,199
but this is a defense and death exercise

433
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
since we can't put pii in the outcome

434
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,480
object of the proof

435
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,320
without defeating our pseudonymity

436
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,639
objectives but i believe it's costly to

437
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,560
scale and a decent deterrent since it

438
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,240
requires you to verify

439
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,639
a valid identity that may be revoked via

440
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
mechanisms later on

441
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,160
exploring the purpose of health

442
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
verification this one's pretty

443
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,959
straightforward

444
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,120
when you go in for a test or a vaccine

445
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
you receive a proof that you received

446
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,279
one

447
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,959
signed by your health provider that's

448
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,560
not tied to your identity

449
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
and while i talk about qr codes as the

450
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,639
solution you could use provider's

451
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,320
digital health solution to a similar

452
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,120
effect

453
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,199
but that's a significant unspecified

454
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,199
integration project

455
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,959
well this is exciting now you have all

456
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,399
the things you need to prove you can

457
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,639
adhere to the strictest of policies

458
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,000
but you shouldn't give them to random

459
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
people they can contain health

460
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,199
information you don't want tied to your

461
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,079
identity

462
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,000
and while they are pseudonymous they

463
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,160
contain static information and are thus

464
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,199
fingerprintable

465
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,720
which means they can be used to track

466
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,880
you as a persistent digital identity

467
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,399
that becomes correlated with your

468
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,000
physical locations

469
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,399
thus on some regular timed interval the

470
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,320
device sends its proofs to a central

471
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,120
authority

472
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
along with some wide locale information

473
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,360
to get a temporary credential used for

474
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,800
admission

475
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,199
and in response your device receives a

476
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
proof from the central authority

477
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
called the ephemeral pass and also a

478
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,839
collection of policy hash digests signed

479
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,880
with this proof

480
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,279
for every possible policy combination in

481
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,120
your wide locale that you're admissible

482
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,440
for

483
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,519
it's a layer of indirection for reducing

484
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,120
information exposure and tracking

485
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,079
potential

486
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,760
the central authority doesn't store any

487
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,000
information or log request metadata

488
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,440
but if you're worried about government

489
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,040
surveillance abusing the central

490
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,920
position

491
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,680
if they wanted your pii or health

492
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,839
information they can more effectively go

493
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,120
straight to the source with county

494
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
officials and healthcare orgs

495
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,199
if they want all your location check-ins

496
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,639
they would have to collude with every

497
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,079
single policy checker

498
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,759
which seems so impractical to be

499
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,920
considered implausible

500
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,839
but failing to uphold our pseudonymity

501
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,040
principles elsewhere

502
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,360
can have severe privacy implications

503
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
here so the organization that runs this

504
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,440
has to be super transparent about their

505
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,320
operations security and privacy

506
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
but anyways once individuals have this

507
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,160
pass it takes very little to prove their

508
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,519
policy compliance

509
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
and they don't need anything in return

510
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,880
so it's functionally a one-step

511
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,000
interaction

512
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
which means a verifier doesn't need to

513
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,360
construct the full interaction object

514
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
containing the outcome

515
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
but they may want to if they need to

516
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
submit information to the central

517
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
authority for fraud or abuse

518
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,680
let's talk about that while policy

519
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,600
verifiers don't have your identity

520
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,839
your credentials are still revocable

521
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,279
valid reasons might include

522
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,680
suspected identity fraud or malicious

523
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,279
non-compliance with other safety

524
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,240
requirements

525
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,240
like refusing to wear a mask social

526
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,160
distance or other reckless health

527
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,279
behaviors

528
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,120
i've made this technically possible but

529
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
largely undefined

530
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,320
since it requires thoughtful rules

531
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,399
involving scoring thresholds and policy

532
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
checker reputation doing this right

533
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,399
would be a significant challenge

534
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,240
since false positives create a huge

535
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,160
burden on individuals to renew their

536
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,279
credentials

537
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,440
and decentralizing policing without

538
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,279
thought often enables forms of

539
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,720
discrimination i wanted to avoid

540
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,240
remember when i talked about how health

541
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,920
questionnaires aren't trustworthy

542
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,600
and exposure notifications don't

543
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,839
guarantee isolation

544
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,519
well it's possible to add some small

545
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,600
assurances around these processes

546
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,440
by verifying people's attestation

547
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,079
ability or their isolation status

548
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,439
the idea is that you start with the

549
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,119
credential that says yes

550
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,599
i'm healthy until i indicate otherwise

551
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,280
which is good enough for less strict

552
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,160
policies

553
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,319
but when you self-report symptoms get a

554
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,319
positive infection diagnosis

555
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,880
or receive an exposure notification your

556
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
attestation credential becomes revoked

557
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,280
so you can no longer check into places

558
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,880
and when this happens you can get an

559
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,480
isolation proof with some exit

560
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,520
requirement

561
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,840
like waiting some amount of days or

562
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,640
getting a negative infection diagnosis

563
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,280
here's what this might look like an

564
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
individual downloads the app

565
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,720
enters their info and acquires an

566
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,000
attestation proof

567
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
this allows them to get passes and as

568
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
some time goes on each day they use the

569
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
app and it asks them if they have any

570
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
symptoms

571
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
well one day they report having a mild

572
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,039
cough and slight fever

573
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
so the app revokes their attestation

574
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,559
proof and acquires an isolation proof

575
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,160
in this case they only have to wait 10

576
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
days before this exchange

577
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,000
before they can exchange this isolation

578
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
proof for a new attestation proof

579
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,360
and then they can acquire passes again

580
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,120
well many days later they receive an

581
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,600
exposure notification from another app

582
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,240
and some mechanism allows this to

583
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,760
exposure notification

584
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,600
to revoke their attestation proof and

585
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,200
begin isolation

586
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
instead of waiting 10 days they visit a

587
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,440
testing site and later on they receive a

588
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
private message from that clinic

589
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
with an attached health proof of a

590
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,799
negative covet infection status

591
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,400
and once it's added to their app they

592
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,240
can exchange the isolation and health

593
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,880
proof

594
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
for a new attestation proof and it only

595
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,400
takes three days this time

596
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
so now that we're closing i want to walk

597
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
through what i believe should be the

598
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,799
main takeaways

599
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,960
disinformation is running rampant

600
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
anti-massacres and anti-vaxxers are a

601
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,840
risks

602
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,760
uh risk to themselves their bubbles and

603
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,280
everyone they interact with

604
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,039
so we need controls that can protect

605
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,880
people from widespread ignorance and

606
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,679
contempt

607
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,440
for scientific consensus and health

608
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
recommendations

609
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,679
digital contact tracing works well when

610
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,200
a lot of people use it and when they

611
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,280
receive an exposure notification

612
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
reliably isolate themselves and get

613
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
tested since neither is well enforced

614
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,080
here

615
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,360
we should probably look at other

616
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,440
approaches as we gradually reopen shared

617
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,320
spaces in the us

618
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,000
we are already using personally

619
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,160
identifiable and trackable test

620
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,720
and vaccination information to restrict

621
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,520
movement

622
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
i expect the scope of this to increase

623
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,440
more as people get vaccinated

624
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,280
and we re-evaluate the risk of keeping

625
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,679
shared spaces closed

626
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,520
on that note i believe you should not

627
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,799
have to

628
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,480
should not have to publish any form

629
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,280
digital identity on a public blockchain

630
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
or use fingerprintable identifiers in

631
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,400
the real world

632
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
nor should you have to share your health

633
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,720
information with untrusted individuals

634
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,320
nor should you have to expose your

635
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,559
location to a central authority

636
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,559
conversely i believe you should be

637
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,960
capable of verifying yourself offline

638
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,640
because the real world is complicated

639
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
and connectedness is not always reliable

640
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,960
and having something printed for you on

641
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
paper is also important since not

642
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,960
everyone has equal access to technology

643
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,039
so we can't use this as a tool to only

644
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,039
lift restrictions for the privileged

645
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
and this is why tests and vaccines need

646
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,559
to be widely accessible

647
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,080
and free for everyone but even if that

648
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,880
was the case

649
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
we can't create false urgency for

650
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
stuffing kids in poorly ventilated

651
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,360
classrooms

652
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
reopening crowded restaurants or leaving

653
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
your mask at home we just don't have

654
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
enough data on immunity yet which means

655
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,720
the policies are unclear

656
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,400
but we do know vaccines play an

657
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
important role in healthcare

658
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,600
so we need some better infrastructure in

659
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
place until we know more

660
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
hang in there and stay safe lives are

661
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
still at sake

662
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,840
thank you

663
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,158
you
