1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,800
i'm so excited to present here today

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,280
my research on a new form of physics

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,920
that pertains to computing and

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
cyberspace

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,560
this presentation is organized as

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,000
follows i'll begin

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,320
by defining this new form of physics

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,240
which i call cyberphysics

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,480
and i will relate it to data science

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,160
i'll then recall some historical

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,079
approaches that were used a long time

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:32,800
ago

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,480
to discover some of the conventional

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
physics that we know today

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
i'll then explain how these approaches

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,920
could be ported to cyberspace

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,719
to discover cyberphysics i will provide

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,079
some insight into the research

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,320
methods that i'm exploring to discover

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,440
cyberphysics

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,120
and then i'll describe some applications

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,719
that emphasize the power

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,280
of cyberphysics to advance both defense

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,239
and attack

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,840
at the end i will open the floor for

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
questions

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,359
cyberphysics consists of mathematical

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,879
rules that control

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119
regulate or otherwise govern the

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,400
large-scale behavior

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
of components of computing such as the

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,640
computer processor the i o device

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,360
controllers

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,200
the memory controller the operating

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
system kernel user processes enhanced

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
applications

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
algorithms and networking cyberphysics

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,280
advances data science

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
by contributing physics-like laws that

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,640
give rise to relations between data

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,119
cyberphysics supports cyber operations

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,159
with high quality

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,720
situational awareness data which in turn

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
could be viewed via visualization tools

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,079
such as heat maps

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,520
and selective revelation of information

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
the most important related work is the

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,000
seminal research of stephanie forrest

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
on the biology of computing with

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
applications to cyber security and

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,880
privacy

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,720
perhaps biology could be viewed as the

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
physics of living organisms

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,640
and physics as the biology of matter

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,560
this is an illustration of a 21st

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
century pipeline computer processor

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,840
as unusual as it may sound a computer

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,160
processor does have some similarity

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,280
to a 19th century idealized heat engine

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,680
both systems take heat a part of which

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
is used to do work

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
and the rest is dissipated in the

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
atmosphere here the system of interest

64
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
is a stage of the processor pipeline

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,239
the logical heat namely data originates

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,920
in the flip flops and is given to the

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,519
gates which compute and has do work

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
some gates do useful work in the sense

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,200
that they produce

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,680
bits that contribute to a machine

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
instruction that is currently running in

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
the processor

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,440
other gates do work that is later wasted

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
in the sense that these gates produce

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,640
bits that are discarded at the

76
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
multiplexer

77
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
the case that do useful work have the

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,319
opportunity to affect the computations

79
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,120
of gates

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
that reside in successive stages of the

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,040
processor pipeline

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
thus the gates that do useful work in

83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,239
one stage

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,040
could be in a causal relation with gates

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,400
in another stage

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
this causal relation takes the form of a

87
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,239
boolean equation

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,640
which extends from one stage to another

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,480
when these two stages are placed in

90
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,840
contact with each other

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,959
via a layer of flip-flops this boolean

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,000
equation is in

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,640
a way behaving similarly to the concept

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,120
of temperature in conventional physics

95
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
thus metaphorically we could say that

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,040
these gates have the same temperature

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,120
which very much resembles the zeroth law

98
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,879
of thermodynamics

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,560
two separate systems are placed in

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,080
contact with each other

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
heat travels from the haas system into

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,120
the coal system

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
there will be some interactions there

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
but at some point the two systems reach

105
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,920
equilibrium

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
and have the same temperature

107
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,840
furthermore there is a sense of entropy

108
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,440
in the processor pipeline

109
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
since the boolean equation of useful

110
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,519
work extends only one direction

111
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,439
from one stage to another and hence

112
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,560
never the way around

113
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
let us now refer to a container of gas

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,799
which consists of a large number of

115
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,000
molecules

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
these molecules continuously move in

117
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,200
random directions

118
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
and frequently hit each other the

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
individual action of a molecule can be

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
modeled mathematically

121
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
the overall behavior of an individual

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,560
molecule can be explained by the

123
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
molecule subatomic design

124
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,798
this is an important detail that we'll

125
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,560
recall later on

126
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,639
in this presentation in relation to

127
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,160
cyber physics

128
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
now all these molecules millions of them

129
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
collectively exhibit

130
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
large-scale behavior which has its own

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
parameters

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
thus there are mathematical quantities

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,160
that characterize the gas

134
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
in the container

135
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,800
this is a graphical illustration of the

136
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,120
molecules of a gas in a container

137
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
examples of microscopic physical

138
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,720
quantities that characterize the action

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,840
of a molecule

140
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,199
include mass velocity and kinetic energy

141
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,040
examples of microscopic physical

142
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,320
quantities that characterize the

143
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,759
behavior of the gas

144
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,960
as a whole include temperature entropy

145
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,080
pressure energy and work there are two

146
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,720
approaches

147
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,639
to discovering the laws of physics that

148
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,720
govern the behavior of this system

149
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
namely thermodynamics and kinetic theory

150
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
thermodynamics is based on empirical

151
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,479
observations

152
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
and experiments to discover laws of

153
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,759
physics that relate

154
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,600
macroscopic physical quantities with

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
each other

156
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,120
kinetic theory leverages the

157
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,039
mathematical models of the individual

158
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,000
molecules

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
we should then use this to step by step

160
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
derive these laws of thermodynamics

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
thus thermodynamics and kinetic theory

162
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,960
are complementary to each other

163
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,639
the laws of thermodynamics can be

164
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
explained and validated by kinetic

165
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,440
theory

166
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
on the other hand kinetic theory often

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
provides unique insights into the

168
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,199
large-scale behavior

169
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,360
of the system which lead to the

170
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,600
discovery of laws of thermodynamics

171
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
in my research i explore methods of

172
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
thermodynamics and kinetic theory

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
more specifically statistical mechanics

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
that discover mathematical quantities

175
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,960
and physics-like laws of cyberspace in

176
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,759
aggregate

177
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
from a probabilistic examination of the

178
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
underlying elements of computing

179
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
i'm exploring extending and applying

180
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
statistical mechanics to the study of

181
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,639
cyberspace

182
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,440
that discover is cyber physics obviously

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,039
cyberspace is fundamentally different

184
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,800
than the physical world

185
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,639
nevertheless some of the concepts of

186
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,560
conventional physics including physical

187
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,160
quantities and laws

188
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
could have counterparts in cyber physics

189
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
furthermore cyber physics could have

190
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
mathematical quantities and physics-like

191
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,039
laws

192
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,560
that may not be encountered in

193
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,440
conventional physics

194
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,880
this is an illustration of a testbed

195
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,720
that aims at collecting data

196
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
in support of the discovery of

197
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,039
cyberphysics now via data-driven

198
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,720
mathematical models

199
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,479
statistical mechanics can work with

200
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,160
subjective probabilities

201
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,240
nevertheless empirical data measurements

202
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,280
are helpful

203
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,120
in assessing the consequences of

204
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,560
subjective assignments

205
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,960
a probability in applied statistical

206
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,360
mechanics and also help validate

207
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
cyber physics discovered via theoretical

208
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
mathematical models

209
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,800
i collect data primarily through

210
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
instrumentation of hardware

211
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,639
and the operating system kernel i also

212
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,080
extend a hypervisor

213
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,319
to exploit system virtualization for the

214
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,520
purpose of data collection

215
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,639
in addition to statistical mechanics and

216
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,479
statistical physics in general

217
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,880
i developed new statistical science that

218
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,840
has stronger affinity with cyberspace

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
a key intervention in statistical

220
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
mechanics is the decomposition of a

221
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,960
system

222
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
into particles while these particles

223
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
have a character of their own

224
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
in terms of behavior they collectively

225
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
give rise to large-scale system behavior

226
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,960
as i described earlier in this

227
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
presentation for the purpose of

228
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,479
discovering cyber physics

229
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
the physical quantities of particles do

230
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,080
not need to be measurable

231
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,280
the physical quantities that

232
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,039
characterize a large scale behavior

233
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,199
however need to be measurable

234
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,599
to be useful to this research the

235
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
counterpart of thermodynamics in cyber

236
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,319
physics

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
is developed via our knowledge of the

238
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
inner workings of a computing machine

239
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,560
data-driven mathematical models

240
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,160
empirical observations

241
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,720
and practical experiments on the testbed

242
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,120
the cyber counterpart of kinetic theory

243
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,360
studies the individual particles such as

244
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,879
gates in a computer processor

245
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,800
or instructions in the operating systems

246
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
kernel and applications

247
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,520
and here i define mathematical

248
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,360
quantities that characterize the action

249
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
of gates and instructions

250
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,559
and then i use methods of statistical

251
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,440
mechanics that use probability to derive

252
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,240
physics-like laws statistical mechanics

253
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
uses a conventional probability theory

254
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,880
that we all know you encounter the usual

255
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,080
tools of probability

256
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
such as cumulative probability functions

257
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,160
probability density functions or

258
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,920
probability mass functions

259
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,760
expectation values and moments of the

260
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,839
probability density functions

261
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
characteristic functions cumulative

262
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
generating functions

263
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,440
sums of random variables and the central

264
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,880
limit theorem

265
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,440
and plenty of other concepts that that

266
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,399
we all learn in conventional

267
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
probability theory thus there are no

268
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,640
barriers to apply statistical mechanics

269
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,439
to cyberspace

270
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,399
this is an illustration of how i

271
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
research the physics-like laws of a

272
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
computer processor

273
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,160
via thermodynamics and kinetic theory

274
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,920
here the particles are the gates

275
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,160
which i model mathematically these

276
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,080
models are statistically refined and

277
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,959
integrated

278
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,880
to obtain a probabilistic description of

279
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,000
the operation of a computer

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,320
processor the physics-like laws of a

281
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,519
computer processor

282
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
can be used to probe for hardware

283
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,680
implants the basis for this is that

284
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,040
hardware implants cause

285
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,000
changes to gates and how those gates

286
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
work with each other

287
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
which in turn results in violations of

288
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
the laws of cyber thermodynamics

289
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
of a clean variant of the computer

290
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
processor

291
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,880
the definition of small-scale

292
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
mathematical quantities

293
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,640
of a gate is one of the most important

294
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,320
steps in this research

295
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,760
we should be able to discover

296
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
small-scale mathematical quantities

297
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
that are disturbed by the activity of a

298
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,040
hardware implant

299
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,959
while disturbances to individual gates

300
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,800
are not measurable the large-scale

301
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,560
behavior of the altered process of

302
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,360
design

303
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,880
fails to comply with the cyber

304
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,720
thermodynamics of the claim processor

305
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,040
another critical factor is the

306
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,399
definition of the large-scale

307
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,760
mathematical quantities

308
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,240
of a computer processor we can inherit

309
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,519
some physical quantities from

310
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,720
conventional physics

311
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,120
including temperature energy and work we

312
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,880
can also seek new mathematical

313
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,600
quantities

314
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
that are added to how we characterize

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the operation of a computer processor

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
and the other components of a computing

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
machine

318
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
excuse me regarding the computer

319
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
processor empirical observables that we

320
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,360
can measure

321
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,680
and integrate with mathematical models

322
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
include performance counter data

323
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
the output of instructions stored in

324
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
memory and the register file

325
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
and also parameters of conventional

326
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
physics such as power consumption and

327
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
electromagnetic emanation

328
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
a particular interest is how the cyber

329
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
physics of a computer processor

330
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
interacts with the conventional physics

331
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
of a computer processor

332
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
in cyber physics as in conventional

333
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
physics the interactions between

334
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,680
particles is a paramount importance to

335
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,079
discovering how small scale action could

336
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:28,800
result in

337
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
emerging patterns of large-scale

338
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
behavior obviously in a computer

339
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,200
processor

340
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,519
gates interact by giving each other bits

341
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
that are the result of their computation

342
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,440
with the occurrence of any type of

343
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,320
hazards in a computer processor we see a

344
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,079
collection of gates in one stage of the

345
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:44,959
pipeline

346
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,320
affecting a collection of gates in

347
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,079
another stage of the pipeline

348
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,920
in general i look for any factors that

349
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
give rise to interaction

350
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,040
between gates or groups of gates

351
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,600
this illustration shows a very simple

352
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
hardware circuit

353
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
that executes single bit and nor

354
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,160
operations

355
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,079
we are simply arithmetizing the work

356
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,440
performed by a gate

357
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,320
by assigning it a numerical value the

358
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,079
case that do useful work are then

359
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
treated as a boolean equation

360
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,560
which gives us a sequence of integers we

361
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,639
encode these sequences of integers via

362
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,079
the girdle method

363
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
guttal encoding gives us a real number

364
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,920
which could be interpreted as a

365
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
quantification of the work

366
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,680
that was performed by the machine

367
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
instruction

368
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,680
when we interpret the bits that are

369
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,760
given to a gate as heat

370
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,240
or a form of energy that enables a gate

371
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,279
to do work

372
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,800
we obtain this data plot that

373
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
illustrates how energy is converted to

374
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:43,519
work

375
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,160
over the duration of a clock cycle here

376
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
we can see a manifestation of the first

377
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,639
law

378
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,680
of the conventional thermodynamics

379
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
this is an illustration of how the

380
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,959
physics-like laws of the various

381
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,560
components of computing

382
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
enter into a hierarchical causality

383
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,000
relation

384
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,160
with each other this is the point of

385
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,839
attention that i referenced earlier in

386
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,519
this presentation

387
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
similarly to how the behavior of a

388
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,959
molecule can be explained

389
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,600
by subatomic structure the physics-like

390
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,760
laws of large networks of machines

391
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,519
can be explained by the physics-like

392
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
laws of individual machines

393
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,079
the cyber physics of a machine can be

394
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,920
explained by the cyber physics of its

395
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,240
operating system kernel and applications

396
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
the cyber physics of the operating

397
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
system kernel and applications in turn

398
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,760
can be explained by the cyber physics of

399
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,480
hardware such as a computer processor

400
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,720
with physics like laws we can finally

401
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,639
make sense of large volumes of random

402
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,160
looking network packets

403
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
or io traffic that are displayed on a

404
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
screen for analysis

405
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
which are otherwise hard to decipher

406
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,000
here once again

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,240
we emphasize the importance of studying

408
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,079
the interaction of cyber physics with

409
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,839
the conventional physics of cyberspace

410
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
i'll now discuss some applications of

411
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,959
cyberphysics

412
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,880
given that we can apply statistical

413
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,959
physics that discover physics like laws

414
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,320
of a computing machine

415
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,839
we could certainly do the same for a

416
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,440
newer network and beyond

417
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,000
meaning the human cognition physics-like

418
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,720
laws of the

419
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,440
cognition of a threat actor enable

420
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,600
defenders to customize exception tools

421
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,639
and algorithms

422
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,880
against that threat actor this could

423
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,720
increase the likelihood of detecting

424
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,920
exploits and malware

425
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,160
developed by that specific threat actor

426
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,920
knowledge of the cyber physics of an

427
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,199
operating system kernel

428
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,199
enables us to adapt operating system

429
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,240
algorithms

430
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
in favor of defense for example the

431
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
physics-like laws of the memory system

432
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,560
provide a stronger characterization of

433
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
normalcy which we could leverage to

434
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
detect deviations caused by x plus and

435
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,199
malware

436
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,120
the main objective of cyber deception

437
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,040
engineering is to create decoys that

438
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,920
resemble closely their real counterparts

439
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
knowledge of the cyber physics of those

440
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,199
real counterparts such as a network

441
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,600
interface card or a solid-state drive

442
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,519
enables us to design cyber physics

443
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,959
compliant decoys

444
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,279
that withstand validation probes that

445
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,839
are sent by exploits and malware

446
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,760
in conclusion our physics mathematical

447
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,639
models

448
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,399
require high performance computing

449
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,480
environment to produce findings in

450
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,839
reasonable time

451
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,320
the mathematical concepts are simple we

452
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,040
work with

453
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
summations of exponential quantities

454
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
cell point integration

455
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
sums of random variables and the central

456
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199
limit theorem nevertheless these models

457
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,720
work with very large numbers

458
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,120
and very large values of data consider

459
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,639
for example that there are hundreds of

460
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,600
millions of gates

461
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,320
in a typical computer processor our

462
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,360
models average

463
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,759
over all those gates and their possible

464
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,800
microstates

465
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
which creates a humongous amount of data

466
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,519
to crack

467
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
at this point i thank you very much for

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
your attention and of course all

469
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:09,839
questions are welcome

470
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,320
you
