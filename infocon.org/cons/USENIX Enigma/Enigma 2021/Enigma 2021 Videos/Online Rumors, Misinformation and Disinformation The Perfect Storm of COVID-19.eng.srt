1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,480
hello i'd like to thank you all for

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,840
inviting me to speak today

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,440
um kate starboard from the university of

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,639
washington i'm going to talk about

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
online misinformation and disinformation

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,400
in the context of covet 19

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,680
and election 2020.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,760
over the last few years a few years over

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,800
the last few months we've been

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,240
experienced they feel like years

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,080
um over the past past few months we've

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,679
been exposed to a lot of

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,479
misinformation we've seen facebook posts

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,000
warning of an imminent lockdown and

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,880
urging us all to

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,600
rush to the grocery store as soon as we

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
could which was probably not the best

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,559
idea in the midst of an emerging

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,760
pandemic

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,039
we've seen social media posts and email

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,559
chains talking about

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,160
home remedies that were supposed to help

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,800
us keep keep safe from covid and as time

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,360
passed

25
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,520
we began to see conspiracy theories take

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,600
root uh for example about the

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
uh what causes the virus and it's in its

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,440
origins

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
eventually we saw this a slick video

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,840
making false and dangerous claims about

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
the virus being planned

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,960
uh and sewing distrust in both masks and

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,920
um and the eventual vaccines this video

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,360
originally posted on youtube spread

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,960
through facebook twitter and several

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,080
other websites

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,759
it eventually received more than eight

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,200
million views on youtube

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
it was taken viral by networks of

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
anti-vaccine activists

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
conspiracy theorists and hyper partisan

42
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,080
media outlets

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,479
which it was a hint uh towards some of

44
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
the intersections that we continue to

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,200
see play out

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
um spreading misinformation

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,640
disinformation today

48
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,759
now rumors misinformation disinformation

49
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,280
are part of the online discourse during

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,040
crisis events but misinformation didn't

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,799
just start with the internet we

52
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,880
as humans have always been vulnerable to

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,479
spreading rumors and misinformation

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,759
during crisis events

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,320
so why is this so crisis events are

56
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,000
characterized first and foremost by

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,960
uncertainty um an event has happened and

58
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,079
we often don't know

59
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,520
its impacts at the moment how many

60
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,799
people have been injured what kind of

61
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,560
damage has been done

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,240
along with that uncertainty we feel

63
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,920
anxiety as humans

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,160
we how do we react to this disaster how

65
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,038
do we you know

66
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,479
how do we take care of ourselves how do

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,239
we protect our families and our

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,200
communities

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,640
and so we don't we don't like this

70
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,319
feeling of anxiety and we don't like

71
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,599
this uncertainty and so

72
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,599
we try to solve these we try to resolve

73
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,959
them and when we do that by coming

74
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,000
together in this process

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,520
that scientists like to call collective

76
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
sense making where we try to to

77
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
to share information with each other and

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,959
come up with explanations theories for

79
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,160
what might be happening

80
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,200
to try to to to reduce our uncertainty

81
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,480
and our anxiety

82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
and unfortunately this collective sense

83
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,840
making process can go awry

84
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,519
um one of its byproducts are rumors

85
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,160
and rumors can be um can turn out to be

86
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
true but often rumors turn out to be

87
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,720
false and so

88
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
this collective sense making process can

89
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,879
can accidentally create

90
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
misinformation this this sense making

91
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
process can also be

92
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
exploited so people um can target these

93
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,959
these processes to try to manipulate

94
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,400
them for their own objectives and

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
historically collective sense making was

96
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,440
happening in physical spaces

97
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
but now it's happening online and these

98
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
exploiters can target

99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,959
these processes from anywhere in the

100
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,440
world so coven 19 turns out to be a

101
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
perfect storm for the spread of

102
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,519
misinformation

103
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,680
we have this persistent uncertainty

104
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
scientific uncertainty where the science

105
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
around covert 19 was incomplete

106
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
and still changing day to day we also

107
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,560
have both prolonged and acute impacts

108
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,159
where the lives of people all around the

109
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,159
world are profoundly disrupted for

110
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,400
months and months and months

111
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,920
on top of that we already have this sort

112
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,599
of distrust in authorities

113
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,280
and displaced gatekeepers where

114
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,200
historically we all kind of

115
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
came together around certain certain

116
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,879
news sources and there was problems with

117
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,760
that

118
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
but now we've got all this access to

119
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,560
different information in different

120
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
places which is great

121
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
except it's often hard to figure out

122
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,799
whom we

123
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,239
can and should trust in addition we have

124
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,239
this heavily politicized information

125
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,680
space which i would argue is

126
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,120
wired for disinformation

127
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
election 2020 was actually it is a

128
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,439
crisis as well we see we're seeing

129
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,400
unprecedented

130
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
dynamic impacts from covet 19

131
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
uncertainty due to delays and counting

132
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,159
mail-in votes which is a reaction in

133
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,439
some cases to the to

134
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,759
trying to adapt to covenanting political

135
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,279
influencers sowing distrust in the

136
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,040
results it started before the election

137
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,639
and continues to this day

138
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,720
and again this heavily politicized and

139
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,520
polarized information space

140
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
now i want to talk a little bit right

141
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,080
now about the difference between

142
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
misinformation and disinformation

143
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
because it's really important for

144
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,320
understanding what's sort of happening

145
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
in our information spaces right now

146
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
so misinformation is information that's

147
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,720
false but not necessarily intentionally

148
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
false like those rumors that

149
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
turn out not to be true disinformation

150
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,960
on the other hand is false or misleading

151
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,000
information

152
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
that's purposefully seated and or spread

153
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
for a specific objective for instance a

154
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
financial or political objective

155
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
disinformation is often built around a

156
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
true or plausible core so something that

157
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,040
people

158
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,840
already tend to have to maybe believe

159
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,360
and then kind of

160
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,919
wrapped up in a wrapper that starts to

161
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,320
mislead them for a particular purpose

162
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,080
and it functions often not as a single

163
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
piece of content but a set of

164
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,320
information

165
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,440
actions or a campaign

166
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,039
i would argue and i think a lot of us in

167
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,479
the disinformation space would argue

168
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,720
that pervasive disinformation

169
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
erodes the foundations of democratic

170
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,880
societies

171
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,600
it diminishes our trust in information

172
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
in government

173
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,280
in the democratic processes processes

174
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,160
themselves

175
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
and in each other now when we look back

176
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,840
to disinformation 2016 it was a big

177
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
story but it was a very different story

178
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
it was decided that we were seeing it as

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
something that was foreign

180
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,800
um perpetrated by by tons of thousands

181
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,199
of inauthentic accounts russian trolls

182
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,919
at the time

183
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
and that was coordinated uh by by an

184
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,600
agency and that was trying to manipulate

185
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
us from the outside

186
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,680
if we look at disinformation in 2020 in

187
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,319
the u.s

188
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,560
election very different story we're

189
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
seeing something that's domestic largely

190
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
coming from inside the u.s

191
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,759
foreign governments were trying to

192
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,360
impact things but they don't seem to

193
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
have played a major role

194
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
instead we saw mostly authentic accounts

195
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
from blue check or

196
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,120
verified individuals along with some

197
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
more anonymous members of the connected

198
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,680
crown

199
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,520
working together and but this

200
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,120
information this information campaign

201
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
wasn't entirely coordinated but instead

202
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:25,520
it was

203
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,560
cultivated even organic in places with

204
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
everyday people creating and spreading

205
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,720
disinformation about the election

206
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,919
for the remainder of this talk i'm going

207
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,440
to draw on insights we learned through

208
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,199
the election integrity partnership the

209
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,120
eit was a collaboration between four

210
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,160
organizations

211
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,319
stanford's internet observatory graphica

212
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,440
the dfr lab

213
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,720
and our team at the university of

214
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,880
washington across the four organizations

215
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,639
we had more than 120

216
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,560
researchers as well as partners in

217
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,800
government at the social media platforms

218
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
and in civil society

219
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
and we worked from august into into

220
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,360
december

221
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,080
conducting rapid analysis of information

222
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
threats to election integrity now that

223
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
encompassed several different types of

224
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,720
information threats but i'm going to

225
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,319
focus here on false and misleading

226
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,360
information

227
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
that functioned as so doubt in the

228
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
election results in other words

229
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
what became the election fraud

230
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,319
disinformation campaign

231
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,160
bankler and colleagues gave this effort

232
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,479
that term disinformation campaign

233
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,639
several weeks prior to the election and

234
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
indeed it began long before november 3.

235
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,919
here's a tweet from president trump's

236
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,680
official twitter account from back in

237
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
june 2020

238
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,199
stating that the election would be

239
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,639
rigged

240
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,479
and here's an example of how the online

241
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
crowd produced evidence

242
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,560
to support that rigged claim it's a

243
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,639
shocking tweet featuring this image of

244
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,840
thousands of ballots in a dumpster in

245
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,000
california

246
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,520
the subtext here is that the mail and

247
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,319
voting pro process is fraudulent

248
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,720
the author a journalist on the far right

249
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
um tweets out this

250
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,160
this image and says big if true except

251
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,759
it wasn't true the ballots were from

252
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,840
2018 they were being recycled

253
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,759
this had nothing to do with the 2020

254
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
election but that didn't stop this

255
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,960
narrative from going viral it was

256
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,080
tweeted and retweeted

257
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
more than 25 000 times here's a graph

258
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,800
showing how it's spread on this graph

259
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
time runs left to right the number of

260
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,840
tweets

261
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,919
sharing this narrative is plotted on the

262
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,160
the y-axis and each tweet is plotted

263
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,199
um at the time it was shared as a shape

264
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,440
on the graph with tweets that are bigger

265
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
representing the accounts of people with

266
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
larger audiences

267
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,240
and so um and so here's the original

268
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
tweet the bottom left of the graph

269
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
and then here's how it moved through

270
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,159
other influential social media accounts

271
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,839
including right-wing media outlets and

272
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,760
eventually was retweeted by donald trump

273
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,399
jr

274
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,240
in what would become a common pattern

275
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,919
across these narratives

276
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,680
now i want to note that we did see in

277
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,279
our analysis some disinformation

278
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,040
spreading on the political left

279
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,200
in particular about claims that the u.s

280
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
postal service was purposefully taking

281
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,720
mailboxes out of commission

282
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
to suppress mail-in votes but the

283
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
disinformation on the left was dwarfed

284
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,600
by what we saw

285
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,399
on the political right leading up to the

286
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,160
election we saw networks of politically

287
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
motivated information activists

288
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,519
social media influencers and

289
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,680
hyper-partisan media outlets repeatedly

290
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,399
picking up

291
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,720
evidence of voting concerns framing that

292
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
evidence in misleading ways

293
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,600
and strategically amplifying that

294
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
content to support meta-narratives

295
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,720
that undermine trust in the election

296
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
this disinformation campaign continued

297
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,760
into the election

298
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
and beyond and it was surprisingly

299
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
transparent for people that were paying

300
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,959
attention

301
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,480
about a week before the election we put

302
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
out a report about what to

303
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,800
expect on election day and beyond

304
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,000
and it included this slide uh we were

305
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
going through different kinds of

306
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,200
of periods we talked about elect what

307
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
was going to happen on election day what

308
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
was what would happen in the uncertainty

309
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,200
filled um in the in the election night

310
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
and maybe the

311
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,240
next few days as the votes were counted

312
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
and what might happen

313
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,080
with shifts from from red to blue or

314
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
blue to red if those happen

315
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,120
and we kind of highlighted some of the

316
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
things that we expected including um

317
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
that photos and stories of mistreated

318
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,360
ballots and malfunctioning machines

319
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,120
would be shared on election day

320
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
that we would see out of context images

321
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,120
and videos that were mixing real content

322
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,000
and and things from the past um we would

323
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,680
see minor discrepancies over

324
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,800
emphasized online in in the media we

325
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,440
also

326
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
figured out that we also thought we

327
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
would see that this information that was

328
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,640
shared in election day would be

329
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,600
assembled

330
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,680
to fit these false narratives of voter

331
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,800
fraud

332
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
and that they would there would be sort

333
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
of both bad statistics used to support

334
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
these as well as premature

335
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,640
declarations of victory that would be

336
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,760
used to sow doubt

337
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,040
and question ships in in um boat tallies

338
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
as well as legal complaints and

339
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
affidavit affidavits filed

340
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
to sort of support these cases in

341
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,519
different ways now we didn't expect that

342
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,120
to be going on through december and into

343
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,839
january

344
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,760
but we were expecting to see that in the

345
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,600
weeks following the election

346
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,360
um what we ended up experiencing

347
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,959
afterwards um

348
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,680
were many of these narratives uh not

349
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,000
exactly

350
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
what we were expecting but many similar

351
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,000
kinds of narratives false and misleading

352
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
claims that observers were denied access

353
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
that was that in some ways were covering

354
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,200
for some kind of cheating

355
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,959
false claims about people moving ballots

356
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,040
and suitcases false claims about large

357
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,000
numbers of dead people

358
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
voting claims that voting machines or

359
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,480
sophomore software systems switch votes

360
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,040
to

361
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,399
to canada biden and so many instances of

362
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,480
torturing statistics to claim evidence

363
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,680
of

364
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,959
massive voter fraud if we look uh

365
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,680
closely at one prominent narrative where

366
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,320
issues with

367
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
sharp sharpie pens grew into a theory

368
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,120
that specifically trump voters had been

369
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,600
french

370
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,760
disenfranchised by being forced to use

371
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
sharpies we actually can

372
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,320
can use this case to see kind of um how

373
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
some of these

374
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
narratives developed now the initially

375
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,399
the tone

376
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,120
of many of these sharpie related tweets

377
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
was one of concern

378
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
worries on election morning that votes

379
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,920
wouldn't count directives to bring your

380
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
own pen

381
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,079
but soon that can turn concern turned to

382
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,120
suspicion

383
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
and eventually the discourse shifted to

384
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
explicit accusation that this was an

385
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,839
intentional effort to disenfranchise

386
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,399
specifically trump voters and though the

387
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,079
first claims about sharpies

388
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
being a problem occurred in chicago

389
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,200
eventually the accu

390
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,920
accusations converged around arizona for

391
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,680
a very strategic reason

392
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
so let's look at how this narrative

393
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,279
spread we ended up seeing we ended up

394
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,560
collecting more than 700

395
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
000 tweets related to voting in the

396
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,480
election that also contained the word

397
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,200
sharpie

398
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,040
and these narratives ended up feeding

399
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,480
into the stop the steel movement that

400
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
we're still experiencing today

401
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,320
but let's just focus on how the

402
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,480
narrative took off late on election

403
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,360
night it was actually

404
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
early election morning about 2 a.m

405
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,360
eastern time on november 4th

406
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
the surge in complaints about sharpies

407
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,320
corresponds very closely to when fox

408
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,800
news

409
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,079
calls arizona for candidate biden and

410
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,360
this was a big shift

411
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,200
in in what the expectations would have

412
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,639
been for the trump campaign on whether

413
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,760
or not they would win

414
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,000
and again early tweets about sharpies

415
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
were distributed around the country but

416
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,040
eventually the sharpie gate narrative

417
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,920
begins to focus

418
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,320
exclusively on arizona and it happens at

419
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,760
right this time so let's see what's

420
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,800
going on

421
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
we had some early initial reports of

422
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
sharpies bleeding through on election

423
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,000
day so they're bleeding through the

424
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,360
ballots it turned out the ballots were

425
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,839
designed

426
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,440
for that and so the vote machines would

427
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
still count the ballots if the sharpies

428
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,399
bled through

429
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,079
but um that it might look like to

430
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,680
someone experiencing it that there might

431
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
be something wrong with their ballot

432
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,079
um so we saw these initial reports on on

433
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,200
election day

434
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
but then we we see what happens at the

435
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,560
time of the surge

436
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,639
is that a series of pro-trump accounts

437
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,399
and right-wing influencers including

438
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,680
conservative acu

439
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
uh activist charlie kirk and then later

440
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,760
president trump's two adult sons amplify

441
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,800
this narrative and

442
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,160
and then it shoots off into the

443
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
stratosphere right so they become

444
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,680
the the the uh the core amplifiers

445
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,720
in how this narrative um becomes part of

446
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,079
the larger discourse

447
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,600
so i'm going to step back here and think

448
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,040
about what's going on with these

449
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,880
dynamics so disinformation as we're

450
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,480
thinking about it as we're seeing in our

451
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,040
in our

452
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,519
analyses is participatory president

453
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,360
trump and his campaign didn't just prime

454
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,279
his audience to be receptive of false

455
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,800
narratives of voter fraud

456
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,720
they inspired them to produce these

457
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
narratives themselves and then

458
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,639
echoed those false claims back to them

459
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,320
it's a very powerful

460
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
experience of of propaganda or

461
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,399
disinformation

462
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,880
it's both top down and bottom up so the

463
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
elite set the agenda they see

464
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
these narratives they they put them out

465
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,760
there in the world but then the

466
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,000
audiences created the evidence to fit

467
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,959
the narratives

468
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,320
they helped and then they helped find

469
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,120
the fittest of of the narratives

470
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
and conspiracy theories and then the

471
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
elites echoed those back to the

472
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,680
audiences

473
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,440
rewarding and motivating them to

474
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
continue to create this this is two-way

475
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,320
disinformation it's participatory

476
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
disinformation

477
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,240
in addition to these participatory

478
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,720
dynamics and is both a result and a

479
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
driver of them

480
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,079
the networks are wired for

481
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,440
disinformation we have

482
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,199
dense networks of mutually following

483
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,959
accounts that repeatedly repeatedly

484
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,320
activate to spread

485
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,639
false narratives this is a table we

486
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,399
created of repeat offenders

487
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,240
in the twitter sphere the accounts that

488
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
were repeatedly influential or highly

489
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,279
retweeted

490
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,639
helping false narratives about the

491
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,720
election go viral feeding into this

492
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
false narrative of election fraud

493
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,040
among the repeat effect among the repeat

494
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,639
offenders we have president trump and

495
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,839
his two adult sons

496
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,760
and president trump's account is the

497
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,199
most highly retweeted account in the

498
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,560
spread of false narratives of voter

499
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,600
fraud in our data

500
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
21 distinct narratives nearly 2 million

501
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
retweets in our in our collections

502
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,600
we also have accounts of hyper partisan

503
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,160
news outlets and pundits here in orange

504
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,839
in green we have conservative political

505
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,360
activists for instance from

506
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,320
turning point usa and judicial watch in

former candidates

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,360
now online disinformation is

516
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,800
participatory and the networks are wired

517
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,880
for disinformation

518
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,839
what we saw on january 6 was a physical

519
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,920
violent manifestation of the same

520
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,720
dynamic

521
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,800
an insurrection attempt motivated by the

522
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,680
same disinformation campaign described

523
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,839
described here in this work with symbols

524
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,240
and memes of internet culture come alive

525
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
in the physical world so what do we do

526
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,000
now

527
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
now the platforms have begun to take

528
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,199
action suspending some of the accounts

529
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
responsible for this disinformation

530
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,759
campaign including

531
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,160
president trump's twitter account and a

532
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,279
whole section

533
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,360
of q anon influencers and maga tweeters

534
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,279
this is a good first step

535
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,120
but too late to address the damage

536
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,639
that's already been done the massive

537
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,040
account

538
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,639
amounts of people who are now living in

539
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,160
an alternative reality

540
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
shaped by these disinformation campaigns

541
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,399
i have hopes that the platforms will

542
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,000
continue to evolve their policies to

543
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,519
better address these issues and i want

544
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,399
to point out

545
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,320
that we pick on twitter a lot but that's

546
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,639
only because they make their data public

547
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
and publicly available for research

548
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
other platforms are seeing these same

549
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,839
problems and in many cases it's just

550
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,279
harder for us to figure out what's going

551
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,079
on there so

552
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
i i feel like we've seen twitter take

553
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,439
some some good actions and we're hoping

554
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,199
that other platforms can do this as well

555
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,720
i really want to recommend that they

556
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,959
develop clear and transparent policies

557
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,280
that enable rapid and decisive action

558
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
rather than waiting for dominoes to fall

559
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,439
uh and being reactive as they were in

560
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,599
many cases on january 6.

561
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,439
um and so they have a long way to go but

562
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,439
this is a lot of responsibility perhaps

563
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,439
too much responsibility to play solely

564
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,319
in the hands

565
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,080
of these platforms and we need to figure

566
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
out other kinds of

567
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,799
of ideas for governance this is a

568
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,640
complex problem a multi-dimensional

569
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
problem and we're not going to solve it

570
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
with a new feature on facebook

571
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
a few bands of problematic accounts or

572
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,679
any other single solution we're going to

573
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,799
need to work together

574
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,679
across academia industry government and

575
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,520
civil society to start addressing this

576
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,640
problem together

577
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,120
to help us become more resistant as a

578
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
society to disinformation

579
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,200
and to start building back the trust we

580
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,840
need to be a healthy

581
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,679
democratic society i want to thank you

582
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,360
all very much and i really want to thank

583
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,640
all the amazing students

584
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,960
postdoctoral fellows and collaborators

585
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
that we've had on this project and i

586
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,840
absolutely wouldn't be standing here

587
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,000
today with anything to say without just

588
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
a massive team effort

589
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,679
to make sense of this election related

590
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,919
data and to and to attempt to make an

591
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,480
impact on this against this

592
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
disinformation campaign so thank you all

593
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,840
very much

594
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,799
you
