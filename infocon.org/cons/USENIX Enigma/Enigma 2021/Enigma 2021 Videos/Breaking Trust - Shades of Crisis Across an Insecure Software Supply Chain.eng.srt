1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,679
hi

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,440
my name is trey herr and i'm the person

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,719
talking to you from the tiny box in the

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,080
corner of your screen

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,440
i'm also director of the cyber

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,720
statecraft initiative at the atlantic

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,520
council

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,640
and while it would have been fun to do

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,080
this in person it's probably best that

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,680
usenext has made this a virtual event so

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,359
let's make the best of it

12
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,640
i'm going to talk with you today about

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,720
breaking trust a project the team here

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,840
at the council and i have been working

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,199
on for more than a year

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,199
to profile attacks and disclosures in

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,600
the software supply chain

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,320
why the software supply chain well even

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,440
though supply chains have been in the

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,879
news a lot lately we don't hear as much

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,640
about software as we do hardware

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,000
which is kind of concerning because

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
first software is everywhere the sheer

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,680
scale of vulnerability in the software

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,360
supply chain is tremendous

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,800
and it grows every time we add a new

27
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
feature to an already over built code

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,960
base or update a product on our machine

29
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
there's also in the us and many other

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,480
countries a lot of commercial

31
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,520
off-the-shelf software

32
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,000
underpinning major defense systems this

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
great quote from david goldfein the

34
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
former chief of staff of the us air

35
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,840
force saying

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,000
when i see the f-35 i don't see a

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
fighter i see a computer that happens to

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,640
fly

39
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
so it speaks to the overall aggregate

40
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,000
attack surface when we talk

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
about software supply chains the second

42
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,840
reason to talk about software is we

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,280
don't build most of the software that we

44
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,920
use

45
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
felipe val sorta's talk at enigma just

46
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,920
last year called this out really well

47
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,360
vendors and developers looked a third

48
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,119
party code for increasingly critical

49
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,320
functions from

50
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,400
the firmware on a mobile phone to

51
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,920
container managers in a large cloud

52
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,720
deployment

53
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,560
to web scale cryptographic libraries and

54
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,759
more

55
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,920
third software and hardware aren't the

56
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,040
same yet

57
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
many of our mental models and no small

58
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,720
part of our regulatory architecture for

59
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,920
supply chains

60
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,759
especially in the united states are

61
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,759
built on assumptions about hardware

62
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,360
software poses different risks and

63
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,439
different opportunities one example is

64
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
how we establish and maintain trust in

65
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,479
software there are things we can do with

66
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,759
code that we can't do with physical

67
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,119
devices

68
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,560
so today i'm going to talk through what

69
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
we've observed in attacks on the

70
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,920
software supply chain

71
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,159
over the last 10 years run through some

72
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
of our methods and the definitions that

73
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,079
we use

74
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,439
talk through a summary of our data set

75
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,759
and its key takeaways identify a couple

76
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,598
of major trends and talk through this

77
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,360
little recent issue with solarwinds and

78
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,560
the sunburst malware that you've

79
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,080
probably been reading about

80
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
finally i'll close with recommendations

81
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,360
and hopefully we'll have time for

82
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,319
questions

83
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,480
before i do anything else a big thank

84
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,680
you to the others from the cyber

85
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,120
statecraft team here at the council who

86
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
made this project happen

87
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,680
william loomis stuart scott june lee and

88
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,440
emma schroeder without them

89
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
i wouldn't be here and there wouldn't be

90
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
much for us to talk about

91
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,239
let's get into it we collected

92
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,599
between 2010 and 2020 139

93
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
different attacks and vulnerabilities in

94
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,879
the software supply chain

95
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,120
we started our collection in october 19

96
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
and ran through to july 2020 when we

97
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,400
published our first report

98
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,920
and the initial version of the data set

99
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,519
at 115 events

100
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,280
we've since brought that data set fully

101
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,400
up to date to the end of 2020 for 139

102
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
total events

103
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,840
what is a software supply chain attack

104
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
the key is attackers compromising code

105
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
upstream of their target

106
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
and manipulating it to compromise some

107
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
downstream victim

108
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,159
this could be adding malware to an

109
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
existing code base altering that code to

110
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
include malicious functionality

111
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
or even just compromising key parts of

112
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
the deployment and development process

113
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,480
like

114
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
stealing a code signing certificate a

115
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,400
disclosure

116
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
for our purposes is a software flaw that

117
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
would have enabled the above

118
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,159
hard-coded passwords in a deployment

119
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,519
server backdoor is written to the

120
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,120
firmware for a mobile phone

121
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,799
anything like that so a software supply

122
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
chain attack has realized

123
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,319
uh software supply chain vulnerability

124
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
is one that could have been

125
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
why talk about both there is a potential

126
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,599
for attacks

127
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,360
and vulnerabilities to show trends that

128
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,040
are really important what's most

129
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
interesting to us about the last 10

130
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
years of these attacks and disclosures

131
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
is less what they're doing and more

132
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,040
where they

133
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,720
are the concentration of different types

134
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
of code different distribution vectors

135
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
how attackers get in the other piece is

136
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,280
we want to profile some of the dogs that

137
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,040
don't bark as much as the ones that do

138
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,480
it's good that we're finding some of

139
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,159
these ads vulnerabilities and disclosing

140
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,640
them

141
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,200
it's bad that they're still cropping up

142
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,159
we looked at

143
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,319
public data only publicly reported

144
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
information for the period between 2010

145
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,200
and 2020.

146
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,720
all of these incidents are based on

147
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,480
blogs media write-ups

148
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,199
articles journal and conference reports

149
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,399
so they don't include private

150
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
disclosures of attacks which never made

151
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,759
it into the public domain

152
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,600
because of that even the trends that we

153
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
identify probably under count the

154
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
frequency attacks on certain high-value

155
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,000
targets

156
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
and they're biased away from regions

157
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,120
that don't receive as much coverage from

158
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
the vendors or the journalism space for

159
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,639
the cyber security industry in the

160
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,080
global south

161
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
this means that the data that i'm

162
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,440
talking through today represents a lower

163
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
bound on the population of attacks

164
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
which undercounts incidents that have

165
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,880
never been made public

166
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
the data set presented here today is the

167
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,080
full 139 events

168
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
and is available today on our website

169
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,160
it's also going to be part of a

170
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
follow-on project looking at solarwinds

171
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,280
and comparing it in detail to seven

172
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
other large-scale software supply chain

173
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,600
attacks over the last decade

174
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,520
so let's get into the meat and potatoes

175
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,880
of what we're actually looking at

176
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
103 attacks and 36 disclosures

177
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
stretching from 2010 to 2020.

178
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,720
everybody can argue about how you build

179
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,320
software we use this

180
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
waterfall model as a simplified and

181
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,240
generalized way to show the distribution

182
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,919
of attacks and vulnerabilities

183
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,560
over these 10 years our goal was

184
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
something that was simple

185
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,000
and was replicatable really to paint

186
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,560
just

187
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,320
where software supply chain attacks and

188
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
vulnerabilities land in the supply chain

189
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,600
and as you can see

190
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,880
it's spread throughout one of the things

191
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,960
that we get into later in the piece is

192
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,720
focusing on hijacked updates which is

193
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,759
featured pretty prominently in the

194
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,280
solarwinds campaign

195
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
but throughout these different attacks

196
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
through open source and proprietary go

197
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
through libraries and just by abusing

198
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,919
update processes

199
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,039
you can see there's a variety of

200
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,320
different pathways into the software

201
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
supply chain and attacks have spread out

202
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,960
across them

203
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,000
what does it tell us first that what we

204
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
compile and the dependencies that we use

205
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,680
matter a great deal there's a lot of

206
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,199
multi-stage attacks

207
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,039
first into an open source library then

208
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,880
to a piece of software then to victims

209
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
and users of that software

210
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,919
second is that there's not going to be

211
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,680
one silver bullet mitigation and so we

212
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
have to think about the whole of this

213
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
life cycle the whole of the supply chain

214
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,759
the third is that updates are a problem

215
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,360
they're an opportunity for developers

216
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,440
and security engineers to push fixes

217
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,960
but they also require a great deal of

218
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,800
trust by the customer it's why we called

219
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,639
this project breaking trust

220
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,240
we'll just call this part foreshadowing

221
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
a couple of key takeaways as we look at

222
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
the data set first is that software

223
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,319
supply chain attacks have been popular

224
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,600
and they're going to continue to rise in

225
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
prominence over time we wrote those

226
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
words back in june and july of 2020 and

227
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
i think we've only seen them come true

228
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,479
unfortunately

229
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,080
second is that software supply chain

230
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,600
attacks that utilize

231
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
this vector are impactful it provides

232
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,759
great bang for your buck if you're an

233
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,600
attacker and want to spend small dollars

234
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
to compromise one target

235
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
to then hit many many more users of that

236
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,639
target

237
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,520
third these attacks are used to great

238
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
effect by states

239
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,759
we profile 30 different attacks in a

240
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,479
database

241
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,160
that have some state nexus that have

242
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,319
been attributed to state organizations

243
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,479
by other individuals other research

244
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,840
groups it's a significant trend out of

245
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,080
139

246
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,840
not just in terms of total numbers but

247
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,520
also in the scale of the impact that

248
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,960
these attacks have

249
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
impacting hundreds of thousands

250
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
sometimes millions of potential users

251
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,599
the chart on the right shows the trend

252
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,360
in attacks and disclosures by year

253
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
orange are software

254
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,520
disclosures blue are the actual software

255
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
supply chain attacks

256
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,599
the big piece that we see here is less

257
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,440
because this is an imperfect sample of

258
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,319
the space

259
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
uh a trend in overall supply chain

260
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
attacks it's more reporting and

261
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,199
visibility to them

262
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,039
but the trend is not good right we're

263
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,039
seeing more of these attacks over time

264
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,479
and they're having pretty significant

265
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,160
consequences there's a great incident

266
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,560
from 2016 and 2017

267
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,639
where attackers compromised the firmware

268
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,639
that came pre-installed on android

269
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,360
phones

270
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
in order to build a back door into those

271
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,479
those users

272
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,440
digital environment the triata attacks

273
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
this kind of effort has happened

274
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,560
multiple different times with different

275
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
vendors although android's been a pretty

276
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
prominent target

277
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,440
given the diversity of that ecosystem

278
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
open source is also a focus

279
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
there was an incident 2018 with webmin

280
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
this unix system configuration tool

281
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
that was released with a vulnerability

282
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,599
that that allowed for remote code exec

283
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,280
that was introduced by an attacker

284
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,360
and was downloaded more than 900 000

285
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,120
times before it was caught and that that

286
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,479
fix mitigated

287
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,639
so there's a significant attack surface

288
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,240
here and it's being exploded on a pretty

289
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,919
regular basis

290
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,919
in terms of trends go through five

291
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,519
pretty quickly first

292
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
we found at least 30 different state

293
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,640
attacks

294
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
including attribution from other parties

295
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,479
to states like russia and china

296
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,958
as well as the united states north korea

297
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,679
iran

298
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,320
and some smaller cases from india egypt

299
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
and vietnam

300
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,200
most of this attribution is sourced from

301
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,040
private firms and from the rest from

302
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,320
government's public statements so we

303
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,560
make no claims of attribution ourselves

304
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
and did work to include all events for

305
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,360
which there was public information

306
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,399
available

307
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,080
the second trend is that these attacks

308
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,839
undermine public key cryptography and

309
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,399
the

310
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,000
certificates used to ensure the

311
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,399
integrity of code the attacks on code

312
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,680
signing even if it doesn't

313
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
actually abuse the update process allows

314
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,800
attackers

315
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,760
access into target supply chains with

316
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,760
pretty great frequency

317
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,000
third we saw attackers targeting widely

318
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,080
used open source projects popular open

319
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,800
source

320
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,560
code across the web and targeting a

321
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
number of different repositories

322
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,519
fourth 25 of these incidents targeted

323
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,120
app stores like the google play store

324
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,240
and apple's app store

325
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
as well as other third-party app hubs to

326
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,839
spread malware to mobile devices and to

327
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,519
compromise developer tools

328
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,519
it's a great example in the xcode ghost

329
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,279
malware in 2018 that compromised the

330
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,720
software development kit

331
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
and was able to impact every single

332
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
piece of software developed with that

333
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,519
sdk

334
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,680
downstream impacting hundreds of

335
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
thousands of users

336
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,040
we're going to talk about examples from

337
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
a couple of these but recent events

338
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
demand a bit more focus on our last

339
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,360
trend which is that

340
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,000
26 of these incidents targeted software

341
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,800
updates

342
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,399
so let me zoom in to the figure here on

343
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,839
the right this

344
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,920
shows the distribution vector of these

345
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,079
software supply chain attacks by year

346
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
so this is how did a software supply

347
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,399
chain attack actually get delivered

348
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,120
to the target and then mapping that over

349
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
the course of the year

350
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,959
that orange bar in the middle that stays

351
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,880
present in almost every one of these

352
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,320
is attacks on software updates 26

353
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
of our incidents targeted updates which

354
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,640
counted for 36 total incidents

355
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
stretching back to 2010.

356
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,640
of those 36 15 targeted build

357
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
infrastructure or development

358
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,560
infrastructure versus updates which is

359
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,240
to say they altered source code or

360
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
compromised an installer or deploy

361
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,519
as opposed to compromising an

362
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,440
installment excuse me a deployment

363
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320
server

364
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,959
so in the case of solarwinds i'm

365
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:47,440
actually

366
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,959
impacting source codes as it's being

367
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,800
built developed by the team

368
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,720
versus an instance uh where i've

369
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,640
compromised an update server and i'm

370
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,680
simply attaching

371
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
my malicious code to an already signed

372
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,440
or about to be signed

373
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,920
package nearly a third of all state

374
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
attacks that we profiled

375
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,240
targeted software updates so it's a

376
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,839
major part of the attack surface and

377
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,040
it's something we want to talk a little

378
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,000
bit more about

379
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
because of the prominence of this latest

380
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
attack on solarwinds

381
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,240
so looking just at this overall

382
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,399
population of 139 events we've

383
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,040
we zoom in to the 36 focused on hijacked

384
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,760
updates let's talk about solarwinds

385
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
solarwinds is an austin company

386
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
austin-based company that builds a

387
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,560
network management

388
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
software called orion orion was

389
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
compromised at least

390
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,440
as early as september 2019 when

391
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,120
attackers were able to gain access to

392
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,959
the company's build infrastructure

393
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,079
and included a malicious library wrapped

394
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,600
into the source code for the overall

395
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,959
program

396
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,440
that malicious piece of functionality

397
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,959
was carried through solarwinds

398
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,560
development pipeline and into its

399
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,079
deployment infrastructure

400
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,839
where it was made available to users all

401
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,440
over the world

402
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,839
that probably began as early as february

403
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,160
20 where that malicious version of orion

404
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,000
was distributed to users

405
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
and it creates an interesting problem

406
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,839
for the policy community because

407
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
as the attackers in this case focusing

408
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,519
just on solar winds for the moment

409
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,600
were able to gain access to one company

410
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,639
they could impact

411
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,440
through that orion software more than 18

412
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
000 customers around the world this

413
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,959
includes names like the likes of

414
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,800
microsoft fireeye nvidia and intel

415
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,639
as well as companies across canada

416
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
mexico israel the uk

417
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
the united arab emirates and more so

418
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
again that cost-to-benefit ratio

419
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,519
one attack on one company yields the

420
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,440
ability to gain access to lots of other

421
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,320
firms

422
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
we see customers between february and

423
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,920
june of 2020 accessing that update

424
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
server downloading those compromised

425
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,720
versions of orion

426
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,240
and the sunburst malware is off to the

427
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
races now i'm not going to talk too much

428
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,279
about what happens

429
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,839
uh once sunburst lands on these in these

430
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,120
organizations

431
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,160
there's some really intriguing

432
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
techniques used to drive lateral

433
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
movement including

434
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,079
the so-called golden saml golden

435
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,519
security assertion markup language

436
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,639
attack

437
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
and a lot of emphasis on attacking

438
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,639
microsoft office 365 and azure active

439
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,600
directory

440
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
um although the company come has come

441
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,560
back to say that there's no technical

442
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,079
vulnerabilities

443
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,519
in that infrastructure it was certainly

444
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,120
a major that identity and access

445
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,399
management technology was certainly a

446
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,320
major factor in the attack

447
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
um so looking at solar winds there are

448
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,079
only one

449
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,399
vector into these attacks on email

450
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,560
infrastructure in office 365

451
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
we see a really classic case of a

452
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,639
patient supply chain attack software

453
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,839
supply chain attack

454
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,040
focused on build infrastructure so

455
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
looking through all of this question of

456
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
software supply chain attacks over time

457
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,000
what is it that we as a community have

458
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
an opportunity to do

459
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,560
how do we address a problem like

460
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,880
solarwinds the us government's going to

461
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
have to get smarter about prioritizing

462
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,120
risk

463
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
and establishing a risk register of

464
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,880
products with the largest potential

465
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,079
blast radius

466
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,680
across both.gov and dot mil networks

467
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,040
that's going to mean improving funding

468
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,959
available to all agencies to modernize

469
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,639
their i.t infrastructure to support

470
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
better security practices

471
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,839
but there's more to this than just

472
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,120
solarwinds as as we've shown 138

473
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,880
incidents more in the last decade in

474
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,839
fact

475
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,680
if you walk away from this talk with one

476
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,600
message let it be this

477
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,519
the security of software supply chains

478
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,440
are lacking and the problem is neither

479
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,000
new

480
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,279
nor likely to go quickly away baseline

481
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,720
best practices are still

482
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,800
too hard to get right and we have to

483
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
find a way to internalize that

484
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,320
performance security performance and

485
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,279
maturity

486
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
tells us more than provenance how well

487
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,920
does a vendor perform how well does the

488
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
security of their product perform over

489
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
time

490
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,440
versus where is that product from still

491
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
to this day too many of our controls and

492
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,199
regulations focus on development

493
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,959
and leave deployment and life cycle

494
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,800
maintenance as an afterthought

495
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,560
too many of those same regulations and

496
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,920
risk management schemes are

497
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,800
implemented in pdfs and in spreadsheets

498
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
instead of digital tool change

499
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,639
and too few of these risk management

500
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,000
schemes recognize our

501
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,680
incredible dependence on software that

502
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,560
we don't buy build or directly control

503
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,720
so to try and address this here is a

504
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,079
snapshot of three clusters of

505
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,600
recommendations we develop in more

506
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,279
detail in the report associated with

507
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,720
this talk

508
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,199
first we have to work to make software

509
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
supply chain attacks less frequent

510
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,120
by making it easier to deploy secure

511
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,240
software thereby improving our baseline

512
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,519
we make two recommend a couple of

513
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,720
recommendations in this bucket but i

514
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
want to call out two

515
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,160
the first is for the u.s government

516
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,680
along with private sector partners to

517
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,160
develop

518
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,800
a lifecycle security overlay from nist's

519
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,120
800-53 controls to take those controls

520
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
that are most applicable to lifecycle

521
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,040
security for a software vendor

522
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,199
and publish them as a separate overlay

523
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,639
make it easier to implement those

524
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,560
controls and easier for firms to pick

525
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,759
those up and drop them into their

526
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,360
development process

527
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,279
the second is we're calling for industry

528
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,040
especially the three major cloud service

529
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,199
providers in the us microsoft google and

530
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,079
amazon to take that life cycle overlay

531
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,480
and

532
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,279
offer public reference implementations

533
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,800
of their products

534
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
so that developers who are new to the

535
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,480
space who are working and don't have

536
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,079
time to read through a pdf to figure out

537
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,000
how to interpret it and apply it

538
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,759
can take a reference implementation from

539
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,199
one of those vendors and drop it into

540
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,440
their workflow

541
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
second while solarwinds and the some of

542
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
the associated attacks around it were

543
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
focused on proprietary code

544
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,480
we can't forget about open source open

545
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,160
source attacks make up a decent

546
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,920
chunk of this data set both in attacks

547
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,199
and vulnerabilities

548
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,959
and we have to do more to secure improve

549
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,959
the security of code that everybody uses

550
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,720
in products both proprietary and open

551
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,680
source

552
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,680
so we have two recommendations here the

553
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,519
first is to provide funding the us

554
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,240
government

555
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,959
on the order of 20 to 25 million for

556
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,639
baseline security improvements in open

557
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,920
source software

558
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,160
this would be a new government program

559
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,320
administered by an existing agency

560
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,959
that provided funding on two tracks the

561
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,320
first was

562
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
discretionary on the part of the

563
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,839
government to any open source projects

564
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,560
it felt were particularly consequential

565
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,120
or

566
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
lacking in significant security maturity

567
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,199
the second would be an

568
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,679
open application for grant funding sort

569
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,880
of along the lines of the open

570
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
technology foundation

571
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,000
where projects and programs could come

572
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,679
and apply for grants

573
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,359
from this program to improve their own

574
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,839
security gain access to security tools

575
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
pay volunteers and overall manage

576
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
more effectively the life cycle security

577
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,280
of their project

578
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,039
the second recommendation here is to

579
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,280
establish a transatlantic infrastructure

580
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,400
initiative

581
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
the us is not going to address this

582
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
problem alone and there's very little

583
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,559
software out there in the world that's

584
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,640
not been globalized in some fashion

585
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,080
there's no reason that the united states

586
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,360
shouldn't be working with allies in

587
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,120
europe in particular but also

588
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,440
asia to address the security of these

589
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,679
products and these open source packages

590
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,080
this kind of funding model and these

591
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,520
sorts of changes to standards

592
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,120
should absolutely be happening across

593
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,720
multiple jurisdictions not just in the

594
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,480
united states

595
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
third we argue that we should be working

596
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,400
to better limit the consequences of the

597
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
most severe supply chain attacks

598
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
and in that is to focus on better

599
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,919
countering systemic threats the two

600
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,840
recommendations i'd call out here

601
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,280
versus for the u.s to add new

602
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
international partners to investigate

603
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,000
and prevent

604
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
catastrophic software supply chain

605
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,919
attacks that's entities like dhs cisa

606
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,000
and the nsa and doj

607
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,919
working with good partners in the uk and

608
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,080
france germany and the netherlands

609
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,559
to make consequences more severe and

610
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,120
investigations more rapid and effective

611
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,960
for major events like the solar winds

612
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
and sunburst attacks

613
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
and last the recommendation here is for

614
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,240
the u.s and allies to support strong

615
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
cryptography and standards and tools

616
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,919
this is one of those bugbears that keeps

617
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
coming back around every few years but

618
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,919
a lot of the software supply chain

619
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
security that we talk about is premised

620
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,000
on strom cryptography

621
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,919
the the signatures the ability to

622
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,520
transfer code between entities and

623
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,840
and at least assert its authenticity a

624
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
lot of that is premised on strong crypto

625
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
and so defending that is a core

626
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,320
principle of any of this work

627
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,200
at the end of the day we have to grapple

628
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,520
with a world that software has created

629
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,039
right notion that software has eaten the

630
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,480
world is sort of old hat but at this

631
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,559
point we got to live with the results

632
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,080
trust in software isn't built in

633
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
isolation it doesn't come from sickly

634
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,960
branded

635
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,280
zero days widespread government mandates

636
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
or from any auto magic industry

637
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
initiative

638
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
it would be a mistake to equate software

639
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
supply chain attacks to a new weapon

640
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
system in an opponent's arsenal

641
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,039
they are a manifestation of opportunity

642
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
attacking secure targets by compromising

643
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,559
weaknesses and connected neighbors and

644
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
vendors and in those dependencies

645
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
but the technology industry the

646
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,400
insecurity of the software supply chain

647
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,480
is a crisis in waiting for the national

648
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,320
security establishment it's a crisis

649
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,280
realized

650
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
and a generation of technology

651
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
acquisition under threat

652
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,799
breaking trust takes time and restoring

653
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,799
it will require concentrated purpose

654
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,160
and clarity of outcome at a time when

655
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
both are in short supply but the

656
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,679
solarwinds response has demonstrated the

657
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,960
extraordinary technical and

658
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,559
collaborative capability of the security

659
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,440
community

660
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
we can drive new research and investment

661
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
to help secure the load-bearing bugs

662
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,720
implement revised policies and

663
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,080
straightforward tools to make secure

664
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,200
development easier

665
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,799
and expand community-led efforts to

666
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,400
bring supply chain security further out

667
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,679
of the darkness of the byzantine and

668
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,720
proprietary

669
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
and into the harsh light of day at the

670
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:17,520
outset of a new year i remain hopeful
