00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,880
hello everyone

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,280
my name is carmela troncoso i'm gonna

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,160
present today

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,320
my experience engineering privacy in

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,600
concentrating apps

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,279
and how hard it was to make it real

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,680
this journey started as a sprint back in

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,160
march 2020 towards the first deployment

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,599
of these apps

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,880
by july 2020 this had become a marathon

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,558
in which we continued working on the

12
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,600
maintenance and by now it is an iron man

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,200
in which not only continue maintaining

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,800
these apps but also working on new

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,559
technology that can help with pandemic

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,239
mitigation

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,559
why did we start working on these apps

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,000
back in march 2020

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,239
when the number of cases increased model

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,760
contact tracing collapsed

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
with smaller contact raising is this key

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,360
tool to help break in chains of

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,480
infections

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,000
it works by interviewing infected

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
users asking them for the close contacts

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,559
and then calling these closed contacts

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,400
to ask them to take precautions and not

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
continue spreading the virus

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,560
as the number of cases increased this

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,159
became just not possible

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,840
that we have was not enough people to

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,680
make these interviews and calls

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,439
so the idea was can we have some

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,920
technology that help us complement the

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,040
manual process

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,400
and help notifying people in a faster

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,280
way

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,000
in a more efficient way that means with

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
less human labor

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,560
and in a scalable way as the pandemic is

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,400
not in one town or one country

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,360
but all around the world and of course

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,920
when i say we need technology to notify

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,840
people that have been close to others

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,880
a lot of security and privacy ring bells

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,920
like can we do this thing and indeed

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,680
from the beginning we were extremely

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
worried about the fact that these apps

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,040
could be misused

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,960
they could be used for surveillance it

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
could be used to manipulate population

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,600
to target individuals and other bad

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,399
things

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,000
so my group was very focused from the

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,320
beginning on creating something

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,000
whose purpose was limited by technology

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
to only be able to do this notification

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
and soon after we discovered that our

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
fears were well founded

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,120
as we saw how data collected for contact

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
tracing whether in the apps or in manual

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
form for instance at restaurants

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,879
was being used by staff or by the police

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,879
for all other users than the one that

65
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,520
was initially collected for

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,720
information is for instance identity

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,640
the location of the users that reveals a

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,160
lot about their identity

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,200
and their preferences or behavior

70
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
who do they meet when do they meet these

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
people for how long

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
how frequently so this is the kind of

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,519
information we wanted to hide

74
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
and of course we also needed that these

75
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,120
applications were secure

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
that means that when you receive a

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
notification it is real

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
otherwise users could not trust

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
application and that it is

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
hard to do a denial of service attack

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,599
because

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,519
it serves for nothing to have an app in

83
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,360
the pockets of millions of users

84
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,280
if the servers just don't work

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
and there was another constraint that we

86
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,720
didn't see in the beginning

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,720
and we don't often see in academia it's

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,239
called reality

89
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
and the first thing is that this app

90
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,319
that we were building as i said it had

91
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,519
to be very scalable

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,920
but it also had to be very reliable

93
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
because we were trusting it

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,000
to help us get out of this pandemic but

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,239
the thing that most

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,159
influenced the design was the time

97
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,080
pressure we had to descend it very fast

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
the pandemic was here

99
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
and that means that we needed to design

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,519
something very simple that we could very

101
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,799
fast verify

102
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,560
not only the design but also the

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,360
implementation so that any property that

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,760
we

105
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,000
thought the protocol would have we could

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,799
verify

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,959
that it was for real and we could ensure

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:51,840
the users

109
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
that they were getting what we were

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,040
promising

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,599
this also meant that we could not use

112
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,120
any fancy technology

113
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
or any technology that did not exist and

114
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,439
we had to rely on existing sensors

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,680
namely the phone and on the sensors of

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
the phone and in this case the decision

117
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,239
was to use

118
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,640
bluetooth low energy and all of these

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,480
created a lot of dependencies

120
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
from existing infrastructure just as we

121
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,599
will see in this talk

122
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
had a lot of impact on the privacy

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,440
properties and the privacy engineering

124
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,839
of the system

125
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
so with this constraints we started

126
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
working and

127
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,800
we had a first idea that i would tell

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
you about but actually

129
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,280
this never got implemented because the

130
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,639
constraint of reality

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,400
and the fact that needed to rely on

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,080
existing infrastructure

133
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280
meant that we had to work on phones

134
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,960
where the operative system is not under

135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
our control the operative system is

136
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,479
built by google and apple

137
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
so they had to be involved they had to

138
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,400
be involved to ensure that the users of

139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,440
bluetooth

140
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
did not consume too much battery

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
otherwise the users

142
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
could not use the applications

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
apple needed to be involved to ensure

144
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
that the app

145
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,240
could read bluetooth beacons in the in

146
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,199
the background

147
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,199
something that was not possible before

148
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,520
because of privacy reasons

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
and they also needed to collaborate to

150
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
make sure that the beacons on ios and

151
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,320
android

152
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,280
would actually be compatible we saw in

153
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
our first experiments where they were

154
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,400
still not in this game

155
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,360
that many times this was not true and

156
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
when they were there

157
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,840
they also decided that it would be the

158
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,360
ones that implement the protocol and

159
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,520
they decided was the api that was

160
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,960
exposed to the apps

161
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
to gain information and this as we will

162
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,240
see in this talk

163
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
had heavy influence on the privacy

164
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,080
engineering um

165
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,400
that we did and i don't have time to

166
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
talk about it today

167
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
but it also had strong impact on what is

168
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
the epidemiological use that we can do

169
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,039
of the app

170
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
and how can we compute uh exposure to

171
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
race alarms

172
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
and also had impact on the privacy of

173
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,720
other parts

174
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
like for instance when you put together

175
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,240
apps from two countries

176
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,800
so how they implemented the protocol

177
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
very similarly to our first design

178
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,160
is that phones generate a secret key

179
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,080
every day called the temporary exposure

180
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,639
key and from this key it derives random

181
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,919
identifiers that

182
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,960
is broadcast in bluetooth beacons these

183
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,440
identifiers have a limited life span

184
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,800
so that they cannot become pseudo

185
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
pseudo-identifiers and you can track

186
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,600
people with them

187
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
and if you don't have the key these um

188
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
these identifiers are cryptographically

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
unlinkable

190
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
so once phones can broadcast they

191
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
broadcast numbers of the time and when

192
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,919
users come close to each other

193
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,280
and they hear the other identifier

194
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
they store it together with some

195
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,800
information

196
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
about the power of the signal that is

197
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
used later on

198
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,000
to as a proxy for distance in the

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,680
computation of exposure

200
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
so here a can see b and nodes

201
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,479
their identifier b can see

202
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,759
a and c so nodes both identifiers and c

203
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,400
is close enough to b but not to a so

204
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,599
only notes down

205
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,720
the identifier of b

206
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,160
when one of the users is sadly

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,319
copied positive they will receive an

208
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,280
access code

209
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
from the doctor and with this access

210
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,479
code they can upload

211
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,840
the keys that their phone generated

212
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,880
during the infectious period to a server

213
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
periodically all of the users download

214
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
keys from this server

215
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,199
and then they derive random identifiers

216
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,400
that were created

217
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,639
and compare them to the list of cis

218
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,400
numbers

219
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,080
if some of these numbers actually

220
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,840
coincide so they have been

221
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
close to people that were covered

222
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,759
positive they would take all of these

223
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,680
power measurements that they said before

224
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,919
and make a joint computation if the

225
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
joint computation establishes that they

226
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,479
were

227
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,080
very close to these people for long

228
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
enough time it will raise

229
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
a notification for the user in the case

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
of switzerland this notification

231
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,400
for instance tells the user to please

232
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,160
send isolate and then call to an

233
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,639
infoline for further instructions

234
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,960
so in this protocol the only information

235
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
that ever leaves the phone

236
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,520
are the temporary exposure keys these

237
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
keys are not associated to the identity

238
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,240
of the users

239
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,840
they are generated at random by the

240
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,000
phone they are not associated to the

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,879
location

242
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,360
they are created as a predefined

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,319
schedule

244
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,160
and they don't have information about

245
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,919
others because regardless of how many

246
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,879
people you have met

247
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,039
and how often you will always upload the

248
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,800
same number of keys the ones that you

249
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,919
produced

250
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,919
as a result there is no information

251
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,760
outside of the phones available for

252
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
abuse

253
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
as an additional a nice feature the

254
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
system senses by design

255
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,679
what does this mean is that if after the

256
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,480
pandemic

257
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,080
countries decide that the system should

258
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,839
be still be existent

259
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,000
users themselves can ensure that the

260
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,519
system dies

261
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,240
by stopping uploading keys to the server

262
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
and therefore there's no more

263
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
information flow

264
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,080
the information in the server is not

265
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,560
useful and the system is basically dead

266
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
in the rest of the talk i would focus

267
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
here on the left part of the

268
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,120
of the graph which is where we had to do

269
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
more privacy engineering

270
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
to ensure that the privacy of the

271
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,480
protocol was lifted

272
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,560
uh throughout the system and this is

273
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600
because the protocol

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
is a very small part the protocol is

275
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,839
embedded of a mobile system as we just

276
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,320
said

277
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,560
that is embedded on an app then is then

278
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
embedded in a bigger health system

279
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,440
and all of it has a lot of constraints

280
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,240
legal

281
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,360
societal and epidemiological and it

282
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,000
turns out

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
that in many of these places you will

284
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
actually find quicksand

285
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
and some parts of the design will not

286
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,360
work and as we will see

287
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,880
we have to change them one of them

288
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,080
is authorization i said that in order to

289
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,720
upload codes the user needs an

290
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,320
authorization code

291
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
that is to avoid that false

292
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,240
trouble false matches if people just

293
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,680
upload keys of people that are not

294
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
positive

295
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,680
of course the authentication mechanism

296
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,560
has to

297
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,480
preserve the privacy of the system and

298
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
it has to be hard to delegate that means

299
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
that i cannot give it to other users so

300
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
that they upload

301
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,360
their keys in that case again we could

302
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,000
have false alarms that could

303
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,560
make people not trust the system we know

304
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
how to do this from a crypto perspective

305
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,279
we could for instance commit to the keys

306
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,560
that i'm gonna upload

307
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,200
such as the access code is tied to my

308
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,079
phone

309
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,240
now this is great but on the one hand we

310
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
cannot do this thing because the

311
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
protocol and the api that google and

312
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,000
apple produce

313
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,120
make this hard but more importantly

314
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
health systems and the stuff in these

315
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,160
health systems

316
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,560
not always have the digital tools that

317
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
we would need to do this

318
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
so at the end we had to go for um

319
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,560
a very simple activation code that was

320
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,839
sent in via phone

321
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,200
or by uh snail mail or sms and some

322
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,399
countries have different level of

323
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,160
automatization in how the code

324
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,399
is created and sent and as far as i know

325
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
only belgium goes for a little bit more

326
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,680
of a fancy protection

327
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,360
okay so we have an authentication

328
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,440
mechanism maybe simple but it is there

329
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,680
are good on from a privacy perspective

330
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,120
if you think about how i explain the

331
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,600
system the only time good users make

332
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
uploads is when they are covered

333
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
positive that means that the very

334
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,480
existence of the upload

335
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
would actually reveal one of the most

336
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
sensitive information in the system

337
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,160
the health status of users so

338
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,320
okay we know how to solve this in

339
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,519
practice it was very good

340
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,440
we wrote it in the first white paper

341
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,279
this can be mitigated using dummy

342
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,160
uploads

343
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,240
literally we know that in reality this

344
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,680
is a bit more difficult

345
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,240
the first pitfall is that when we think

346
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,959
about this

347
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
in academia you always know how the

348
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,040
system works because you decide

349
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,320
how systems users behave in reality

350
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,600
we didn't know anything about

351
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
environment and what the user behavior

352
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,079
is

353
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,920
especially with a new application

354
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,680
deployed in a new situation that never

355
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,920
had happened before

356
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,040
also we had to rely on a platform

357
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,360
that had their own constraints like

358
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,160
bandwidth

359
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,920
not only we could not consume all of the

360
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,279
data plan of the users

361
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
but also we could not put a high law on

362
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,279
the network which is actually an actual

363
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,560
service provider

364
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,639
that could be upset if we just consume

365
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,000
too much traffic

366
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
we also need to make sure that we don't

367
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,279
take down the server

368
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,360
by making too many petitions because of

369
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,560
dummy traffic

370
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,200
this costs money and also it is hard

371
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
when the load is too high

372
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,519
and of course we need every time you

373
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,200
send traffic you can zoom battery on the

374
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,760
phone

375
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,279
and we need you to be very economical

376
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,519
with this because we know that

377
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,440
if the app consumes too much battery

378
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,560
users directly uninstall it

379
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,639
also because we cannot use

380
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,880
infrastructure that is not mainstream

381
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
anonymity networks were out of the

382
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,959
questions and delays are not possible

383
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,519
remember we want a timely application we

384
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,720
want to be faster than

385
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,639
our contact tracing so we cannot go

386
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,800
around just waiting to upload

387
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,040
things to the servers to have more

388
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,399
privacy

389
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,360
as a result we had to settle for a weak

390
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,600
privacy property plus a deniability

391
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,760
that we build by ensuring that these

392
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,720
uploads

393
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,839
are like um in constant time and size

394
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,440
with respect to real uploads

395
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
and you can read more about the details

396
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,959
of our protocols and decisions

397
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,639
in the document that is at the bottom of

398
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,120
the slide

399
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,600
and okay this is cool

400
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,959
but as i said before there is

401
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,200
authentication that means that the graph

402
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,360
is not as simple as this because to get

403
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,720
this authentication code

404
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,399
what actually happens is something a bit

405
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,760
more complicated

406
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
when i get the authentication code this

407
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
is generated by a second server

408
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,160
that we had to create in reality that

409
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,079
didn't exist in the white paper

410
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,399
and then the user would send this out

411
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,440
access code to the

412
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
server that would return a signed token

413
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,040
that is would you use to actually do the

414
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,240
upload

415
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,199
this means that the dummies must also

416
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,959
realize this authentication step

417
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
to be indistinguishable this means that

418
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,480
now two servers

419
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,680
have to be aware that there are dummies

420
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,160
and have

421
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,639
processes to deal with them and on both

422
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,079
of them have to ensure

423
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,000
that there is equal processing time and

424
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,199
traffic volume

425
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,680
regardless of this being a dummy or a

426
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
real upload

427
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
to make things more complicated in the

428
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,600
early versions of google and apple

429
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,320
before version 1.5 there was one

430
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,680
security mechanism

431
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,480
to avoid replay attacks it was that the

432
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,120
key

433
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
would only be provided to the

434
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
application after it expires

435
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,720
this is great and i must to say that it

436
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,160
is not really necessary this was an

437
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
implementation option to simplify

438
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,079
and will it simplifies that party makes

439
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,519
has many others

440
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,240
so one of them is that if now a key

441
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,160
comes later you have two options delay

442
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,279
or keys

443
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,079
or send the key on the next day of

444
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,440
course we cannot delay

445
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
and to send the key up the next day it

446
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,120
means that the authorization is an extra

447
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,920
step

448
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,839
how we solve this it was a very dirty

449
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,560
hack in which we had the application

450
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,519
sorry the server giving us a second

451
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,959
token that we would use

452
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,000
to upload the last key on the day after

453
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
now that means the damage also must do

454
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,519
this extra

455
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,320
upload but when done is happen all of

456
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,079
this happens in the background

457
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,760
and it turns out that when you work on a

458
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,360
platform like a mobile app

459
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,920
application you have no warranty that

460
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
your app will always wake up

461
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,000
and do whatever it has to do again

462
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,079
better your battery optimizations by

463
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,199
the phone manufacturers and now

464
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,880
we had to deal with the fact that many

465
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,720
times the phone does not do exactly what

466
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,519
we would

467
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,720
so our computation had to take this into

468
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,440
account

469
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,519
again and encourage you to read our

470
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,360
design paper to learn more about this

471
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
and it's the final thing that we had to

472
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,279
do to ensure that privacy was really end

473
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,160
to end

474
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,680
is to take into account that servers

475
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
don't exist in a vacuum servers don't

476
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,279
exist in a very pretty wireless slider

477
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,959
like that they want to have here

478
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
they actually live on a cloud that looks

479
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
something more like this

480
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,440
for a mapping at the very left we have

481
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,160
the doctor

482
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
at the top of the phone and then the two

483
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
servers that we were using

484
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
and this yellow layer that you see in

485
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
the middle

486
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,279
that's actually the typical cloud

487
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,120
infrastructure that is necessary

488
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
for security and operative purposes load

489
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,720
balancer a firewall

490
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
and it turns out that those off the

491
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
shelf tool do a lot of logging

492
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
that we didn't think about when we were

493
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,240
designing the system

494
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
and that meant that we had to redesign

495
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,160
what kind of information is locked

496
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,399
by our servers to make sure that there

497
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,279
was no

498
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,160
forensic analysis possible the same held

499
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,040
for any type of

500
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,519
statistics that we would collect to

501
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,199
monitor the working of the app

502
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,800
we needed to make sure that when

503
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
correlated with information that this um

504
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
of the shelf tools would collect which

505
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
by the way we have no control on and we

506
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,639
cannot change

507
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,959
would not break the privacy of the users

508
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,959
we had to redesign the login strategy a

509
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,079
bunch of times

510
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,680
to ensure that privacy was always

511
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
conserved

512
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
these apps by now are in many countries

513
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
around the world the ones in green here

514
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,679
use our code base and therefore have the

515
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,280
extra protections i have talked about in

516
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,240
this talk

517
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,880
and in switzerland we have around 1.9

518
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,199
million active users which is 22 percent

519
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,720
of the population

520
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,839
guruna study back in october with a user

521
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,720
service

522
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,959
and we discovered that users are pretty

523
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,000
compliant

524
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,039
the 80 of them upload codes and a 22

525
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,880
percent are sent to quarantine

526
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,520
out of which one of 10 tests positive

527
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
after they receive an app notification

528
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
most importantly the app notification is

529
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,919
actually faster

530
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
one day before than the notification

531
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,400
that users would receive via the phone

532
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,520
avoiding a lot of contagion

533
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
so what are the key lessons to take away

534
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,760
from all of this experience

535
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,559
first of all data is not a must we can

536
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:54,960
build

537
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
extremely nice applications without a

538
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,559
piece of data

539
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,240
second is the privacy engineering goes

540
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,000
well between crypto doing the krypton

541
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,919
the protocol is just the starting point

542
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,360
and when you have to do this privacy

543
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
engineering in an other world where

544
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
requirements change and would you depend

545
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,360
on

546
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
services on which you don't have control

547
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,720
this is exhausting

548
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,160
you have to change all the time your

549
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,080
designs to account for reality

550
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
constraints

551
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,679
and finally the technology can be

552
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,120
perfect but if you don't have

553
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,840
good social integration then there is no

554
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,679
way that it succeeds it's what happens

555
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,640
with these apps

556
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
with a lot of problems stem from the

557
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,480
fact that non-digitalized health service

558
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,960
cannot really give good support to the

559
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
technology that the app has

560
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,440
and this is why it is very important

561
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,799
that from the beginning we're going to

562
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,640
deploy something that we cannot test

563
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
beforehand like was in these apps there

564
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,760
was no time

565
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
purpose limitation is done from the

566
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,960
beginning

567
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,880
so please if you're gonna deploy any new

568
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
technology take this into account

569
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,840
and respect your users thank you very

570
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
much

571
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,520
you
