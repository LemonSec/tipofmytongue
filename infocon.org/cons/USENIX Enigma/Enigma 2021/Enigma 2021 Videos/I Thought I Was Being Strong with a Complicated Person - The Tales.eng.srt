1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,360
hi everyone my name is sophia silly and

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,040
i'm a researcher and implementer of

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,880
cryptography and classroom

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,720
my job focuses on implementing and

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,080
theoretically thinking about

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,080
cryptography and computer science

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,920
but i also think about intersection

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
between privacy and security

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,840
and what users actually face as a threat

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,760
in the real world

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,840
today i'm going to be precisely talking

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,159
about a topic related to the latter

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,760
in the sense that the topic that i'm

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
going to be speaking about is how

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
digital tools i use to enhance

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
gender-based violence this is indeed a

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,800
pro topics that covers many axioms

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,559
but has mainly been talked about from a

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,399
global north perspective

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,480
today my aim is to bring you the global

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,520
cell perspective

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,199
specifically the latin american

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,600
perspective as the way digital tools are

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,199
used to harm people should not be

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,440
thought of as it is applied equally to

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
all but rather as a phenomenon that

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,640
is intersected by many other factors the

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,479
way that it is not truly used to enhance

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,080
gender-based violence in the global

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,560
north

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
is not the same as what happens in the

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,880
global south

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,119
a small disclaimer for this talk i will

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:13,920
be talking about

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
instances of domestic abuse sexual

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,960
violence

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
and discrimination in general if at any

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,119
point you feel uncomfortable during the

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:21,759
talk

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,759
please feel free to stop the video or

41
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,960
leave the video

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,200
in general please reach out to someone

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,960
and make yourself feel safe

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
your mental health is important so

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
please take care of it

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
we'll also like to say that this talk is

47
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,119
dedicated to anyone who has experienced

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,560
gender-based violence

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
in general and it's a call to action for

50
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,280
us all who make digital tools to think

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,479
about it when we design

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,280
systems or applications for us to build

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
a digital world where this does not

54
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:49,600
happen

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,280
or at least it's not enhanced

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,360
this talk is also a remanded reminder

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,119
that we can work together to change the

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,840
situation

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,159
if it sounds difficult or it sounds too

60
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,040
sad

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
in latin america we have achieved change

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
by working together and asking for this

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,920
change

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
we as women have united and that's what

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
exchange we have not been aided by

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
governments of big corporations or big

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
organizations

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,959
we have actually achieved change by

69
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
protesting together by marching together

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
and by actually achieving the change

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,440
together so if we can do it as women in

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,080
latin america you can also

73
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
you can also ask for this change and

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
actually make it happen

75
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,120
so how can we start this talk where does

76
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,160
one begin

77
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
one of the things that i didn't realize

78
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
more than a year ago when this research

79
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,720
is started

80
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,640
is that there's not so much research

81
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,800
around the mother as there is research

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,080
on other topics

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
the reasons for this could be many but

84
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
one of the top ones could be that the

85
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,920
thinking that digital tools are used to

86
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,599
enhance gender-based violence

87
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,200
is not approved they think that this is

88
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
not a pervasive phenomenon

89
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,280
or because the bibles appear to not

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,560
appear so publicly

91
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
this is not to shame that survivor

92
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
should appear more publicly but actually

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,599
to note that maybe that is one of the

94
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,959
reasons why research

95
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
is not so focused on this area for me

96
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,920
this research came from a personal

97
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,760
experience because i was suffering from

98
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,920
gender-based violence that was aided by

99
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
digital tools from this personal

100
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,920
experience it became a shared experience

101
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
because friends of mine were actually

102
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,959
experiencing the same

103
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,720
it became their community experience

104
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
because the local organizations i reach

105
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,799
out to all the women's organizations

106
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,080
that i reach out to

107
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
were actually experiencing the same and

108
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,840
i later found out that this is a global

109
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
situation because it happens in every

110
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,080
country

111
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
and in every region of the world and in

112
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,519
many countries it has actually been

113
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,760
declared as a pandemic as it happened in

114
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,120
mexico

115
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
in my case it was a recruit usage of

116
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,200
digital tools to enhance gender-based

117
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
violence

118
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
as i was warned that my ex-father might

119
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,560
try to saw more in my devices

120
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,799
but it was a subtle one as well as he's

121
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,879
revealed my social media posts to try to

122
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,560
find any hidden meaning

123
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,480
that could be used to discredit me or

124
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,720
harm my reputation

125
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,319
through this he managed to make me lose

126
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,760
my job indeed

127
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,360
and it is in this way we should take

128
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
notice digital jews used enhanced

129
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
gender-based violence are not

130
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,720
technologically sophisticated most of

131
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,599
the times

132
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,680
there are sort of in the realm that they

133
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
we think that is not so much of a big of

134
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,319
a deal

135
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,360
but it is indeed

136
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,358
gender-based violence is the first cause

137
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,358
of death of women all over the world

138
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
in countries like mine because i come

139
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
from ecuador in ecuador every 71 minutes

140
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
a woman is killed for being a woman

141
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
we like to emphasize here that they are

142
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
killed actually for being a woman

143
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
because most of the times when i speak

144
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
about this sentence or

145
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
or people read this sentence they think

146
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
that women are killed because they were

147
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,800
trying to get mocked or any other reason

148
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
but indeed they are keen because they

149
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,960
are women and i would like to emphasize

150
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,479
here that this is not a problem that

151
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,000
only exists in the global north

152
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
but also exists in the global south must

153
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
be even more pervasive in the global

154
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,639
south

155
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,560
i would like to say here also that

156
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,320
digital tool was used to enhance

157
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,520
gender-based violence

158
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
it's not a problem only of the global

159
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
nodes even though in a global node of

160
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,759
course people

161
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
may be using more digital tools than

162
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,960
your global cell

163
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,280
but gender but digital tools used to

164
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,800
enhance gender-based violence

165
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,960
it's also happening in the global cell

166
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,240
with differences yes

167
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
but it's also happen

168
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
i said there is research around how

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
digital tools are used to enhance

170
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,880
gender-based violence

171
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
but it mostly focuses in global north

172
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,360
and scenarios what he focuses on and has

173
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
found is that gender-based violence

174
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
through digital tools happens

175
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,639
by the usage of mobile and social

176
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,560
engineering it is well noted in the

177
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
social engineering part

178
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,160
it is a sort of social engineer in the

179
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,759
sense that is not rampant on

180
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,000
active cohesion but rather the gathering

181
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,240
of information to guest passwords or any

182
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,080
kind of way that they can

183
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
think about to access the accounts of

184
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
survivors for example

185
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
we will compare this later point to how

186
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,919
it actually happens in the global south

187
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,400
so what is the state in the global south

188
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,319
specifically in latin america

189
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
after briefly listening to what the

190
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,840
research has already done in the global

191
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,400
north

192
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
will we find the same results with the

193
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
same techniques applied

194
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,359
to the latin american region

195
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,199
the first thing to know around this

196
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,720
question is that there are not so much

197
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,440
research

198
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,039
there is local research from local

199
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,039
organizations or what can be gathered

200
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,400
from the experience of our blessed

201
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,840
bibles themselves

202
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,759
this is our main source for our ongoing

203
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,919
research what we find out is that there

204
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,000
are specific ways in which digital tools

205
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,639
are used

206
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
and we try to come up with a methodology

207
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
ways to classify them in order to

208
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,160
further explain them

209
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,400
why we try to come up with a methodology

210
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,759
because when we actually start

211
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,520
researching about this we found out that

212
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
there was not so much

213
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
literature around how to actually

214
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
classify the different ways in which

215
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,639
digital tools and used to

216
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,560
enhance gender-based violence actually

217
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,800
expressed

218
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
this is what we will explore through the

219
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,240
next slides from the tears of the

220
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,280
survivors themselves

221
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
the first classification is of course

222
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,720
sexual violence as this is the most

223
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,080
prevalent use of violence

224
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,120
aided by digital tools a 22 years old

225
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,479
woman recollected

226
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,720
they sent photos of me intimate photos

227
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,880
to the whatsapp that we have as a group

228
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,280
at the university they took those photos

229
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,919
without

230
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,960
me wanting them to i have attached here

231
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,240
also the spanish text

232
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
because most of the times people think

233
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
that these things do not actually

234
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,960
actually exist so they don't think the

235
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,639
digital tools are used to enhance in

236
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,840
their base balance

237
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
at all so i'm actually attaching here

238
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
actual tales from actual survival

239
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
so you all think that this indeed is

240
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,199
happening

241
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,199
in this tale we see here two instances

242
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,400
of digital tools

243
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,000
an instance of taking a photo in a

244
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
non-consensual way and an instance of

245
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,560
massively sharing it over social media

246
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
this situation can be thought of as a

247
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,800
trivial one as is often referred to

248
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,960
but it is not taking a photo in a

249
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
violent way and later saying it is

250
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,520
reenacting

251
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
the violent act gets committed again

252
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,879
every time the photo is shared

253
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,879
another woman tells and at first on this

254
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,360
slide i have attached the spanish text i

255
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
will see here in the next

256
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,599
slide the english text the translation

257
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,639
she says

258
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,400
i don't know who's read me i don't know

259
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
who it was they sent me messages threats

260
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,639
against my family they say they were

261
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,440
going to talk

262
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,280
about me that they were going to tell

263
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
them who i really was

264
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
they asked me for explicit photos and

265
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
videos and i sent them to them

266
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,319
the photos and the video reached out

267
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,479
everyone everyone at my school

268
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,360
i felt bad and i can't talk to anyone

269
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
she was at the time a 15 years old

270
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,159
student

271
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,479
this tale plays into many aspects of the

272
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,479
region the first thing is of course the

273
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,360
cohesion

274
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
the survivor was not sharing something

275
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,958
willingly but was forced to

276
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,839
because society in general is disforcing

277
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,440
the attacker knew quite well that she

278
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,360
would not want to tell her family about

279
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,640
her private life

280
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480
because it is shameful to be found as a

281
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
woman that you have any kind of sexual

282
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,040
desire

283
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,440
whether you are a sexual being at all

284
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800
therefore she complace

285
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
she complied because it was easier than

286
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,959
facing the misogynistic society

287
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,360
there's a common stereotype that women

288
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
in latin america are hot

289
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
or sexually liberated or dressed

290
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
provocatively in a free way

291
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,959
the reality could not be further from

292
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,200
the truth that in american societies

293
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
could be very misdemestics

294
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,640
and play into the idea that women's

295
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
sexuality is private

296
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
and if it becomes public it is the cause

297
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,360
of shame

298
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,760
abusers use this notion to cohese women

299
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,120
in a blatant way

300
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,880
in the sense that if a relationship

301
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
lends for example

302
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,160
they will share any photo over social

303
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,800
media they use this to punish women for

304
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,680
leaving a man

305
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,839
to publicly suppose that she's a sexual

306
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,080
being one of the tactics that we use

307
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,920
with women that we work with

308
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
that experience this is to tell them

309
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,040
that having the photos

310
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,360
bus maybe it's not such a bad thing and

311
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,959
that maybe the best thing is that if

312
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,959
they own that narrative

313
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,200
this of course is just a band-aid of a

314
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,839
huge problem a problem of misogyny aided

315
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,440
by the massive way in which private

316
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,399
borders can be leaked a woman that

317
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
committed suicide in brazil after having

318
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,760
the photos leaked

319
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,320
said excuse me if i wasn't the perfect

320
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,880
daughter

321
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,079
the school paseo now fearfully perfecter

322
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,640
to her parents she said this after

323
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,920
having her photos were

324
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,320
publicly exposed she said it's not

325
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
because she was being irreverent

326
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,160
but because she was sad of the shame

327
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,240
that she was putting her family

328
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
on a shame that she'd not wanted nor she

329
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,600
intended nor she cost

330
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
this quote is taken from a study that is

331
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
linked later on talk

332
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,399
the natural question to ask here is then

333
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
how is this media share how are these

334
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,399
videos and photos actually share

335
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,160
there's a prevalence in latin american

336
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
facebook and whatsapp groups where these

337
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
photos are actually shared

338
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,320
and actively shared men's groups or

339
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,240
matching clubs in a way where men rang

340
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
themselves around how many photos they

341
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,720
can share

342
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,800
or who has the best video who has the

343
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
best photo

344
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
on the other hand sexual violence is

345
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
also prevalent

346
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,600
and is also used to intimidate women

347
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,760
that are public it is a common thing

348
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,760
that photos of male genitalia are sent

349
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,079
to public figures that are women

350
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,480
it is also a common thing the creational

351
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,560
hashtags that instigate violence against

352
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,760
women such as

353
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,839
sinata golpiano diamond if he doesn't

354
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,120
beat you he doesn't love you

355
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,880
you might being a misogynistic beautiful

356
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,399
golfer when you're your woman if she's a

357
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,800


358
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,920
what happens when women are public and

359
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
own their narratives their sexuality

360
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,880
their feminism

361
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
their struggle we have seen a little bit

362
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,560
already on how attacks

363
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959
actually happened then but let's explore

364
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
them more in depth right now

365
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,360
a woman recollects they have advised me

366
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,920
not to be a feminist so public

367
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,079
this is a common unwanted advice that is

368
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,040
often given

369
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,200
when a woman is open about a struggle or

370
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
about being a feminist or about in

371
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,120
general just being public at all

372
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
and this advice means that if you're

373
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
public you are the subject of shame

374
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
you're the subject of violent acts

375
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,920
so how does this shame happen women get

376
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,079
shamed by targeted social media messages

377
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,240
by head speech by sending up sexual

378
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,880
imagery

379
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,600
and by much more in many instances we

380
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,120
have even discovered that there are

381
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000
groups that teach

382
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,480
how to do this and how regular meetings

383
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,440
about this

384
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,279
they have worshipped with these this

385
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,959
worship that actually

386
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,440
they actually list who kind of public

387
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,160
profiles

388
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,000
women they have they should actually

389
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
target and what is the best strategy to

390
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,959
actually target this women

391
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,360
in the case of moa mobile is only used

392
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,519
by vms in the case of a high public

393
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,320
profile figure that is a woman

394
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,160
as governments are the ones who know how

395
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,360
to buy the broadway

396
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
and have the economic prostitution to

397
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,959
actually buy the kind of malware

398
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,120
we have seen this in almost any latin

399
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,880
american government that has actually

400
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,440
bought

401
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
more way from finfisher or the hacking

402
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
team

403
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,000
the results of these threats that are

404
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,079
actually more public and happening over

405
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,480
social media or by the usage of malware

406
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,720
actually escalate physical violence that

407
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,519
can be

408
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,920
um it can result in physical violence of

409
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,480
the death of the victim in this case

410
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
this is different to what happens in the

411
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,519
global now

412
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,320
not because the situation of escalation

413
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,480
to actually physical violence and not so

414
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,399
common in the global north as it is so

415
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,440
common in the global salt

416
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
what happens in the private sphere in

417
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,839
the private sphere the scene is not so

418
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,639
different

419
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,680
as what we have already seen the usage

420
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,519
of digital tools to enhance gender-based

421
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,519
violence is again not a solar one

422
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,079
it is one that is on the face abusers

423
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,160
here in this region do not try to guess

424
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,120
the passwords but

425
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,279
actively ask for the victims of

426
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,160
survivors

427
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,240
to actually say the passwords themselves

428
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,480
because men feel entitled to be asking

429
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,560
for these kind of things

430
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,639
or they take the devices for victims to

431
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,600
isolate them

432
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,040
which denies them the access to

433
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,360
communication to education or to have

434
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,040
digital literacy

435
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
during the covet 19 pandemic most of the

436
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,279
latin american governments chose to

437
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,959
solve the education problem

438
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,440
by using digital tools it was deeply

439
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,600
ineffective as many households do not

440
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
have access to several devices that can

441
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,760
be used in order to access education

442
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,320
or to access to remote work but it was

443
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,760
really worse in the case of women

444
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,959
because it was

445
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,360
prioritized that manchester us should

446
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
have the access to people but these

447
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,399
devices are not women

448
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,639
which is better the the gap of women are

449
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
actually achieving the status of being

450
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,199
digital literate

451
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,959
latin america is one of the regions that

452
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,399
have the lowest rate of

453
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,880
of people being digital literate it is

454
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,639
the lowest among women as handling

455
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,240
technology is often thought of a

456
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,199
commercial

457
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,959
and women are often discouraged from

458
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,959
having devices or even attending

459
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,720
computer related events

460
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
such as attending university studies or

461
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,040
workshops or in general attending a new

462
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,920
workshop

463
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,680
any kind of event that focuses on

464
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
teaching women

465
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
how to operate devices or computers or

466
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,560
being safe or

467
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,079
online in the case

468
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,160
in this case specifically women do not

469
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,320
often realize that many of these

470
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
tactics that men use are actually

471
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
violence because

472
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
being in a misogynistic society if you

473
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
think that this is the normal way that

474
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
men should act they think that men

475
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,880
should be listened to

476
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,639
that this is what normally happens but

477
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
this is how a relationship should be

478
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,480
when a man in a relationship takes the

479
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,040
devices from the woman from her partner

480
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,199
from her panel in their relationship

481
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,800
they think that this is a common ground

482
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,440
and the men

483
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,920
actually are entitled to do this they

484
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,519
think this because they think that they

485
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,360
are aiding a man that they are being

486
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,199
strong with a complicated person

487
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
that they are helping a man that might

488
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
have any other psychological problems so

489
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
therefore should be listened to

490
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,320
this is what actually happens and it

491
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,759
happened also in my case

492
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,000
so what is the future what can we

493
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
actually do

494
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,880
the first thing is that we should

495
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
actually

496
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
change the way in which we think about

497
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
research we need research that takes

498
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,839
into account the scenarios from

499
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,880
different countries

500
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
and from different regions and that

501
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
research that does not only focus on

502
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,440
more malware

503
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
i know that more that they actually

504
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,800
study on mobile is actually

505
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
fascinating because it could be

506
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,040
technologically more challenging than

507
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,199
only thinking about how to solve social

508
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,320
media

509
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,079
but more well as we have seen is

510
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
actually not the main problem in many

511
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,959
places we should also ask social media

512
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,759
platforms

513
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,680
to do better in other countries besides

514
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,519
the global north because what actually

515
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
happens is that when we raise concern

516
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,920
to certain social media organizations

517
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,720
about an

518
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,279
ongoing attack against women or a

519
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,880
survivor who is right now

520
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,959
facing some kind of violence in her

521
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,480
usage of social media

522
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,320
is that these concerns are not actively

523
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
listened to well in the global know

524
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,040
sometimes this

525
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
is actually listened to because accounts

526
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,399
do take do

527
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,279
do get taken down or social medias get

528
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,040
actually or social media accounts can

529
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,839
actually get

530
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,160
shut down well when this happens from

531
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
some countries from the global south

532
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
this actually does not happen

533
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,240
when i was researching about this we i

534
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,439
also researched around

535
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,039
the state of the privacy laws in

536
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,880
different latin american countries

537
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
and i was really surprised that most of

538
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
the privacy laws that actually exist in

539
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
these countries

540
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,359
do not take into account experiences of

541
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,799
women of what they are actually

542
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
experiencing online

543
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,400
and this should actually be we actually

544
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
compare we should actually compel them

545
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,039
to actually

546
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,679
include in the privacy laws because this

547
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,119
is an experience that is actually

548
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,880
actively happening in

549
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,080
at least half of the population

550
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
we should actually rethink how the

551
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,280
sharing of intimate media

552
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
should be actually happening over social

553
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,400
media

554
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,039
or over any other kind of media we

555
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,000
should actively

556
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,320
create platforms platforms that actually

557
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,880
allow users to securely and privately be

558
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,600
sharing this

559
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,559
intimate image

560
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,320
and with this i would like to end this

561
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
talk with a little bit more a happy note

562
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,840
in the sense that i would like to

563
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
encourage again as i study this talk by

564
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
saying that if we act together we can

565
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,960
actually share

566
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,919
we can actually change this situation um

567
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,000
i put this up here a photo of the

568
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,720
of the women's march in argentina in

569
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,679
which one of the

570
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,080
main slogans were juntas which means

571
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
together in spanish this means that if

572
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,400
we act together we should we can

573
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
actually change

574
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,200
the status of what is right now

575
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,520
happening because this is something that

576
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,600
as a society and as a community that

577
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,440
actually develops digital tools should

578
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,240
be taken

579
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,720
into account so we together can change

580
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,679
things and

581
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,600
this not only to say that this is the

582
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,039
scenario and it is sad

583
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,280
but actually to actually ask you that

584
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,120
please work together and change the

585
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
situation

586
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
here are some of the resources that i

587
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,640
have used to actually give this talk

588
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,080
that you're encouraged to read

589
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
this is actually organizations that are

590
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,520
working around thinking about how

591
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
digital tools are used in

592
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,559
transgender-based violence

593
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,000
the first one from ecuador the

594
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
the leather one is from brazil another

595
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,520
one is from mexico

596
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,120
and here i have also attached a blog

597
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,640
post of my experience on how

598
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,440
actually i was facing the usage of

599
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
digital tools to actually enhance

600
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,160
gender-based violence and with this i

601
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,440
would like to thank you all for

602
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,640
listening to me

603
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,799
and i'm open to any questions if you

604
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,679
have any

605
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:24,640
so thank you

606
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,720
you
