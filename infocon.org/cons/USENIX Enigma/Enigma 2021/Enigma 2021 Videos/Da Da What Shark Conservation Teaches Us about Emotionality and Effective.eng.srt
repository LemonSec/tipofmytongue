1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,519
growing up

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,240
i dreamt of becoming a shark scientist

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,320
and i worked my ass off to earn a

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,120
scholarship

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,960
to one of the top collegiate marine

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,680
biology programs in the united states

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,840
in fact all of the shark photos in this

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,600
presentation are ones that i took

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,240
during my diving adventures but like

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,640
many professionals tuning in today

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,359
my career path includes a few unexpected

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,640
loop-de-loops

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,719
and i somehow stumbled into a long-term

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,800
relationship with security and privacy

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,120
and to this day i find lessons from

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
shark science and conservation to be

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,760
particularly relevant for security and

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,039
privacy

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,039
and this is because they share a number

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,000
of critical characteristics

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,079
the first is that incidents in both

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,120
fields

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,559
tend to be emotional second the risks

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,480
will never be zero despite our best

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,559
efforts and our best defenses and even

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,040
the benefits of engagement

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,760
third the public is often ill-informed

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,119
and scared of the topic in general

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,439
and fourth science-based policy

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,560
unfortunately

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,600
is not the norm i've now spent

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
most of my career helping security and

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,560
privacy practitioners proactively

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
think through their style and mode of

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,159
communication

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,880
in order to optimize the type and

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,200
quality of possible outcomes available

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,479
to them

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
improving outcomes such as secure

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,600
development adoption

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
representative and inclusive policies

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
and user education

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
but not all potential outcomes are

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,600
possible

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,840
depending on your approach and how you

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,680
execute your strategy

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
and so the goal from a communications

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
perspective is to ensure the

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,880
availability

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,360
of the outcomes you want before you try

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,719
to pursue them

52
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,200
now generally speaking organizations can

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,479
do this by

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,960
constantly evaluating and measuring

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
their communication goals

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,318
and in order to secure and seize the

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,038
specific

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,400
opportunities they need however the last

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,200
several years

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,080
i've become increasingly troubled by a

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,760
communications phenomenon

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,560
present among leadership who oversees

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
security and privacy

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,040
in both the public and private sectors

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,760
and that

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,480
is the use of crisis as a governing

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,599
strategy

68
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,080
too many institutions from governments

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
to businesses

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
have become addicted to the manipulation

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,640
of fear

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,480
among the people we claim to protect

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,519
now governing by crisis is different

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:43,920
from

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,560
crisis management which is merely the

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,400
way that we respond and mitigate

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,519
unexpected circumstances or events

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
governing by crisis has a few very

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,879
distinct characteristics

80
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,519
first it may seem like policies change

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,400
all the time

82
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,680
by the hour the day or the week it's a

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
policy whiplash second

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,360
everyday blunders routinely escalate

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
into crisis before they're remediated

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,280
things that really shouldn't become a

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,519
crisis easily become one because they

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,519
are mishandled

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,280
third taking advantage of public anxiety

90
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
for something to be done now just to

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
push an action that protects your own

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,519
self-interests

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,239
is a good indicator that you are tapping

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:30,720
into

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,319
government governing by crisis

96
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,519
and finally emotionality is used in an

97
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,879
attempt to control

98
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,920
the process and protect the powerful

99
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,519
now i've introduced this term

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,040
emotionality

101
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,000
so what exactly does it mean generally

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
speaking emotionality refers to

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,720
how we ex how we experience and express

104
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,840
emotions

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,480
it's a natural part of being human and

106
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,239
can be expressed in as many different

107
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
ways as there are different people

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
however when this particular aspect of

109
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,319
human nature is exploited

110
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,040
it be ca it can become a threat to

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,400
effective communications

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,439
as well as effective incident response

113
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,159
in both politics and business emotions

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,720
never stand in isolation

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,798
in fact they're a manifestation of the

116
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,000
biases and

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,639
influences that we have that enable the

118
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,199
distribution of emotional expression to

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,320
certain groups

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,919
on certain issues and at certain times

121
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,880
emotionality in governing whether in

122
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,840
politics or

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,040
corporate setting provides a framework

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,360
for

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
understanding the central question of

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,360
who gets what

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
when they get it and how they will get

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,560
it

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
the practice of emotionality is where

130
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
i'm going to focus my remarks today

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
because it's something every one of us

132
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,400
can learn to identify

133
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
call out and eradicate from our

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
communications response

135
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,840
following an incident especially when

136
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,080
we're engaging with government agencies

137
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
business leaders or consumers now before

138
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,759
i go

139
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,240
too far down the path of emotionality i

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,280
do want to say

141
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,320
a few things about fear and that's

142
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
because a lot of people

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,759
are afraid of sharks although there are

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,520
certainly cultures where sharks are

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,400
revered

146
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,680
or worshiped but in places where fear is

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,840
the predominant public reaction to

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,120
sharks

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
it's really difficult for scientists and

150
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,240
conservationists to convince governments

151
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,280
to pass good policies that protect the

152
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,720
marine environment

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,800
and we see the same challenge and

154
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,759
struggles

155
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,639
in passing good policy for security and

156
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,400
privacy

157
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,479
and this is because public fear puts

158
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,000
pressure on leaders

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,039
not only to react but to react

160
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,840
immediately and that often leads to

161
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,199
knee-jerk reactions

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,319
and short-sighted policy decisions

163
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,639
as security and privacy professionals we

164
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,080
need to acknowledge

165
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,280
but responsibly educate people about the

166
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,160
risks

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,360
without inciting panic i know it's

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
easier said than done

169
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,520
but it's critical that we build this

170
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,400
skill

171
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,199
as a standard expectation throughout our

172
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,240
industry

173
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,039
because fear also impacts learning and

174
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,759
information retention in the human brain

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,319
it is common for emotional events like

176
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,560
shark bites or security incidents

177
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,759
to cause people to feel afraid and this

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,639
matters

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
because it's a natural response from the

180
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
amygdala in our hindbrain

181
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
which prepares us for fight or flight it

182
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,000
increases the flow of adrenaline and

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
oxygen rich blood to our muscles

184
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,400
which is why our heart rate increases

185
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,440
but it also

186
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
closes off connections to our prefrontal

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
cortex

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,319
which is the part of our brain

189
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,720
responsible for complex problem solving

190
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
and judgment

191
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,160
it's why we train first responders and

192
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,520
incident response teams

193
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
over and over again on protocols and

194
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,800
procedures

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
because in a crisis they will need to

196
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,039
override the instincts of their

197
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,280
hindbrain

198
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,360
i was first introduced to the term

199
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
emotionality through the work of dr

200
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,639
dr christopher pepin neff a senior

201
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
lecturer in public policy

202
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,880
at the university of sydney dr pepin

203
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,840
neff's work

204
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,000
looks at emotionality in the context of

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,599
sharp shark bites

206
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,000
to create room for a greater critique of

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,520
emotional

208
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,599
taxation placebo politics policies

209
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,720
as therapy and knee-jerk reactions

210
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,199
some of his recent findings can be found

211
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
in his book flaws

212
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,680
which was published in 2019 and i highly

213
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,520
recommend it

214
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,919
dr pepin f applies the concept of

215
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,879
emotionality

216
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,800
within the context of government and

217
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,520
public responses to various shark bites

218
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,319
throughout history in his research dr

219
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,520
pepineff found

220
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
that following shark bites political

221
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,560
actors

222
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,280
often select policy responses that are

223
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,919
designed

224
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,800
to appear as an attempt to relieve

225
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,520
anxiety

226
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,759
and boost confidence in themselves but

227
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
actually do very little to address the

228
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,280
underlying risk

229
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,319
now of course this conclusion picked my

230
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
security communications spidey sense

231
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,039
dr pepin f counts remarks that when

232
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,000
sharks bite humans governments and

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,120
policy makers

234
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
fear a public outcry and emotions are

235
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,440
pitted against

236
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,640
evidence-based policy making

237
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,599
he mentions in his book two specific

238
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,640
troublesome

239
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,000
examples that i want to discuss today

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,320
one is western australia's lethal

241
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,680
control program

242
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,080
and the second is the political and

243
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,160
media frenzy of florida's

244
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
infamous summer of the shark keep in

245
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
mind as i go

246
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
through each of these examples that in

247
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
the aftermath of an

248
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
incident particularly those that are

249
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
influenced by media

250
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,480
attention external pressure increases

251
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,279
for leaders to act immediately and this

252
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,080
is for better or worse

253
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
western australia operates one of the

254
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
longest running

255
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,839
lethal shark control programs in the

256
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,720
world

257
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
in 2012 it implemented a serious and

258
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,040
imminent threat policy in order to

259
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,760
justify

260
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,040
hunting catching and killing sharks

261
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,920
preemptively

262
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,279
simply for swimming near beaches

263
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,000
and then 12 months later had to change

264
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,279
the criteria

265
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,480
to be merely a serious threat after a

266
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,519
government review

267
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,360
found that the policy created false

268
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,880
expectations

269
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
and in most cases would result in

270
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,399
failure

271
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
according to the review the criteria of

272
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,120
an imminent threat was problematic

273
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,600
because it made inaction possible and

274
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
opened the government up to criticism

275
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
additionally scientific research

276
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
continues to show

277
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,079
that these lethal efforts are not only

278
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,120
ineffective

279
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,760
at preventing shark bites they're having

280
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,040
a negative impact

281
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,079
on other marine creatures and habitats

282
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
moreover the continued use of these

283
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,079
policies has resulted in a public

284
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,120
backlash

285
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,959
because the government's position is

286
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,360
perceived as a reaction

287
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
against people who support sharks and

288
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,200
the public debate has

289
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
increased their visibility and

290
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,319
resistance

291
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,760
the sensationalized summer of the shark

292
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,320
was invented by u.s media in july

293
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,440
of 2001 and it continued four

294
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,079
months despite no evidence of an actual

295
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,320
increase in shark bites

296
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
and it continued until the terrorist

297
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,519
attacks

298
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
of september 11th which effectively took

299
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,320
over the news cycle

300
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
so despite both in

301
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,880
overall shark bites and fatal bites

302
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,200
being down from the previous year the

303
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,279
media was successful in creating a

304
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,480
moment of hype

305
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,839
and political frenzy and we see

306
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,920
similar responses from government

307
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,839
industry and media

308
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,600
in the context of security and privacy

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,560
one example is the ongoing debate

310
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,040
between

311
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,519
strong and end encryption and national

312
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,720
security

313
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
the entitlement of law enforcement to

314
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,360
explore every possible investigation

315
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,600
method they can possibly imagine

316
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,279
is a familiar pain point for our

317
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
community most obviously

318
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
because many government agencies are

319
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,160
loyal and intentional subscribers

320
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,279
of emotionality and use it without shame

321
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,000
to capitalize on public emotions

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
following incidents

323
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,519
in order to push their agenda forward

324
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,959
under the perception

325
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
of taking firm and immediate action in

326
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
response to an event

327
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,800
after each attack in san bernardino

328
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,440
london

329
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
and paris law enforcement again called

330
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
for back door access

331
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,880
to encrypted messages even as we learned

332
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
about the early warning signs they

333
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,000
ignored

334
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,839
the constant call for weakened

335
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
encryption is an attempt to relieve

336
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,800
anxiety and boost public confidence in

337
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
these agencies

338
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
by demonstrating action but it actually

339
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,200
does

340
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
little to address the underlying

341
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
political economic

342
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,200
or cultural motivations that cause these

343
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,279
attacks in the first place

344
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,240
so why do agencies keep up the the

345
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
facade

346
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
especially when from a communications

347
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,040
perspective

348
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
they would be far more effective to

349
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
start with rebuilding public trust in

350
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,639
the institutions and laws

351
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,639
that govern the use of data for national

352
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,680
security

353
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
by putting safeguards in place first

354
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,920
before asking the public to issue a

355
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,040
blank check

356
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,320
against our privacy and human rights

357
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,200
not just in the words and policies but

358
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,160
in practice

359
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,920
and with consistency in essence

360
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,000
they're not doing this just for the sake

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,839
of public appearance but because

362
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,839
crisis is actually how these agencies

363
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,240
govern

364
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,720
it's how they move from one moment to

365
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,240
the next

366
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,720
the most momentum they may ever have

367
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,399
because otherwise they don't know how to

368
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,519
get it

369
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,079
is immediately following an incident

370
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
especially if they can incite fear and

371
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,440
panic

372
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
responding to an inciting crisis is how

373
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,360
many of these agencies and political

374
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,000
players

375
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,320
move their policies agendas and

376
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200
ambitions forward

377
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,079
the second example is data breaches and

378
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,680
privacy enforcement

379
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
data breach and privacy enforcement are

380
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,440
some of my favorite emotionality

381
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,199
examples because they're among the most

382
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,560
predictable

383
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
outraged media statements from

384
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,519
politicians based on limited information

385
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,839
followed by demands for ongoing

386
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
never-ending congressional hearings that

387
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,680
are actually used in practice to

388
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,920
grandstand any number of unrelated pet

389
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,279
projects

390
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,519
and then followed by a settlement or

391
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,639
legal judgment

392
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
that while very well intentioned and

393
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,399
often deserved

394
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
still does very little to address the

395
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,800
underlying forces at play

396
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
we don't hear about every shark bite in

397
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
the world just like we don't hear about

398
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
every security or privacy incident in

399
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,639
the world

400
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,720
there are a number of reasons for this

401
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
involving both media and policy agendas

402
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,279
but the issue i want to raise here is

403
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
the use of emotionality

404
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
to label incidents and take political

405
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,240
action

406
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,720
according to whose agenda needs a crisis

407
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
today

408
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,519
remember that exploiting emotionality is

409
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,000
an attempt to manipulate the situation

410
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,040
in order to benefit the powerful this is

411
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,000
not to mean that there

412
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,920
shouldn't be enforcement following

413
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,320
incidents that cause harm to consumers

414
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
of course there should but when those

415
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,519
with a financial interest use

416
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,040
emotionality to gain

417
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,120
influence and attention following

418
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
someone else's failure

419
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,680
we justifiably call that ambulance

420
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,320
chasing

421
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,360
yet for some reason we allow politicians

422
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,839
and even sometimes our bosses to get

423
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
away with it

424
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
leaders are eager to issue statements

425
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,720
and propose

426
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
performative legislation to capitalize

427
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,959
on media frenzies

428
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,399
while well-funded vc-backed startups

429
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,639
that collect personal information like

430
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,160
financial or location

431
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
data aren't even required to do the bare

432
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,759
minimum

433
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,639
of deploying multi-factor authentication

434
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
scanning for credential dumps or

435
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,759
notifying users of

436
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,759
unexpected logins the similar red flags

437
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,800
present in the way

438
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
organizations respond to shark bites and

439
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,279
security incidents

440
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,519
are concerning the first similarity is

441
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,440
the militaristic style

442
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,079
of many government and vendor responses

443
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,440
from as early as

444
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,240
the world war ii we've seen governments

445
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,639
around the world deploy military force

446
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,399
as part of their public response to

447
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,759
shark bites

448
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,600
and that is starting to happen in

449
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,440
security as well

450
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,120
however armies are not shark whisperers

451
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,360
but they do demonstrate power on behalf

452
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,560
of the government

453
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,240
its security theater and reflects

454
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,959
a lack of appropriate subject matter

455
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,079
expertise as

456
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,199
well as intellectual integrity remember

457
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,399
people in power are tapping emotionality

458
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,800
when they want to exercise control or

459
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,360
hide underlying motivation

460
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
the second consideration is salience

461
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,079
or the speed of political attention

462
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,839
which is often driven by media

463
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,880
narratives dr pepin neff found a strong

464
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,759
correlation

465
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,360
between the use of the term shark attack

466
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,759
in press stories and the parts of the

467
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,199
world that experienced

468
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,240
public panic regardless

469
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,880
of the facts surrounding the incident

470
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,440
this public panic in turn

471
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
drove worse policy outcomes because

472
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,039
politicians felt more pressure to act

473
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,039
quickly with actions that didn't

474
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,799
necessarily address the underlying

475
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,559
issues

476
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,720
but the problem isn't always the shark

477
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,400
bites themselves

478
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,720
but the media attention that directs

479
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,079
political attention

480
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
to specific events while ignoring others

481
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,520
there are always shark bites and

482
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,039
security events that receive

483
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,760
little to no attention from the press or

484
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,679
politicians

485
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,640
some cases count while others don't and

486
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
the decision as to which is which

487
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,120
is often based on which stories sell

488
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,600
ultimately we end up time after time

489
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
with a core of government and industry

490
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,640
leaders

491
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,600
falling back on the age-old crutch of

492
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,960
political emotionality

493
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,919
unfortunately political emotionality

494
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,799
whether from public or private sector

495
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,360
following a security incident often

496
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
leads to perceptionary

497
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,400
and effect and ineffective enforcement

498
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
perception narrowing is when we're

499
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
unable to notice

500
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
or deal with subtle aspects of a

501
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,559
situation

502
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,039
because we're fixated on a single

503
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,799
element

504
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,600
what these examples of shark bite and

505
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,440
security incident response

506
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,400
show us is an over dependence by

507
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,200
governments

508
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,640
and industry to govern by crisis

509
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,360
and when we consider the long-term

510
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,440
implications for our industry

511
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
our profession and consumer security as

512
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,120
a whole

513
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
this approach could not be further from

514
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,559
best practice

515
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,120
it's a series of knee-jerk reactions

516
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,360
designed to protect the powerful

517
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,640
and control everyone else so

518
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,919
what would a successful communications

519
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,039
approach look like

520
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,720
in the aftermath of an incident

521
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,720
in 2005 cape town south africa

522
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
started a shark spotter program after a

523
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,039
series of great white shark

524
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,720
bites in the area local stakeholders

525
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,799
shark conservationists and community

526
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,840
members

527
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,000
organized to do something before

528
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
politicians stepped in with a knee-jerk

529
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,520
reaction

530
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,320
their approach was to proactively reduce

531
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,360
the interaction

532
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,000
and conflict between beachgoers and

533
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,640
sharks

534
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,080
with an early warning service provided

535
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,440
at strategic beaches in the area

536
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,919
now a lot of the characteristics of

537
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,760
their program are things that would play

538
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,320
well in security and privacy responses

539
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,360
as well

540
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,799
first is it was proactive

541
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,400
they weren't just waiting for something

542
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,559
bad to happen in order to catch a moment

543
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,480
of momentum

544
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,640
second is it was community-based and

545
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
involved a plethora of stakeholders

546
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,159
third they really built a public service

547
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,320
they provided early warning signs for

548
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
the public

549
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,799
fourth they provided access to the

550
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,520
public

551
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,360
of both current and historical

552
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,640
information

553
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
so the public was is informed as they

554
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
possibly could be

555
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,520
fourth they were really focused on

556
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,600
reducing dangerous interactions they

557
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,240
weren't just

558
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,919
witch hunting after the fact and lastly

559
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,840
it was focused on strategic locations

560
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,720
and specific species of sharks they

561
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,120
weren't casting a wide net

562
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,200
imagining that every risk and every

563
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,840
threat was the same

564
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,400
and to this day the sharkspotter program

565
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,280
in cape town

566
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
stands as one of the best programs in

567
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,559
the world

568
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,440
i believe their proactive and

569
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,000
community-focused approach

570
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,880
could also be adopted by our industries

571
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
to get ahead of knee-jerk

572
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,760
political responses and help advance the

573
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,880
state of our own

574
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,039
organizations beyond governing by crisis

575
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,679
unlike the lethal control programs in

576
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,120
western australia

577
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,080
or the ongoing encryption drama and data

578
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
breach frenzies

579
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,880
it was individuals not the government

580
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,760
in cape town who came together to design

581
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,000
and implement a solution that protected

582
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,120
their communities

583
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,799
and led to real results thank you so

584
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,919
much for your time

585
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,840
and i look forward to your questions

586
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,039
you
