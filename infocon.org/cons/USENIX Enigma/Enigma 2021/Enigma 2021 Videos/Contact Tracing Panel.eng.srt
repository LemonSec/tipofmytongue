1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,200
good morning

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,480
or good afternoon welcome to the second

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,960
day

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,920
of usenix enigma 2021 and the only panel

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,240
that we have this year

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,439
we have assembled four fantastic experts

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,720
marcel salate from epfl ali lang

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,519
from google tiffany lee from boston

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,640
university

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,519
and michael judd from the cdc to talk

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,479
about digital

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,160
contact tracing now

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
the reason that we cannot all be here

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,760
together in the same physical space

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,160
is of course covet 19. and since the

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,520
beginning of the pandemic

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,440
you've probably heard the term contact

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
tracing what is contact tracing

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,399
maybe you've seen the movie contagion

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
where kate winslet

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,520
does a lot of jobs and one of the jobs

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,039
is contact racing she runs around

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,039
looking for people who have been

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,399
infected

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,319
and people who have been exposed to

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,920
people who have been infected

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,479
and she does her best to isolate them to

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,640
contain the spread

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,799
that is contact tracing and she's

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,560
running around because the faster she

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,280
moves

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,600
the faster she isolates people the

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,640
better off we are

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
in terms of containing the spread of the

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
disease

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,080
2020 is when covenant 19 emerged and of

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,560
course

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,680
like many other things in 2020 a lot of

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,799
people started asking

40
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
can we apply technology can we maybe

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,960
use our cell phones which have gps

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,920
location

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,360
the ability to communicate with each

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
other the ability to talk to central

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
servers

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
can we use cell phones to facilitate

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
contact tracing

48
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
to record if you will the people that

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,560
we're close to

50
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,240
so that if somebody

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
is unfortunately infected with covet 19

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,560
then we can backtrace

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,960
their contacts and as soon as this idea

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,079
was proposed

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,719
many questions came up should we even

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,920
use technology

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,439
after all we've been doing contact

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,360
tracing for decades without it

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
do we even need it now even if we

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,520
implement it

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,879
since public health departments have to

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
be involved will they know to deploy how

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,080
to deploy it

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
will they even deploy it is it something

65
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,319
that they'll want to do

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,640
will users install whatever application

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,720
they need to install on their phone

68
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
will people game the system what about

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
this location data

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
will it get misused will this even work

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,560
are we just trying to solve a problem

72
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
that we don't really need

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
to solve in this way to answer all these

74
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,760
questions

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
i want to reintroduce our panel of

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,599
experts marcel salate

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,440
ali lang tiffany lee and michael jed

78
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,840
and i urge all of you to get in slack

79
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
get in the channel

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
ask questions and i will do my best to

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
moderate them

82
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
and now marcel over to you

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,280
good morning good afternoon good evening

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,720
good night wherever you are

85
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,920
my name is marcel salate i'm a digital

86
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
epidemiologist

87
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,280
i run the digital epidemiology lab at

88
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
dpfl

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
epfl is one of the two swiss federal

90
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,280
institutes

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
of technology and based in geneva

92
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
switzerland

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,720
so i want to briefly talk about the

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,920
development

95
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
of the dp3t protocol and

96
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,959
the launch of the swiss kovit app which

97
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,840
is switzerland's proximity tracing app

98
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,080
based on the exposure notification

99
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,799
framework and i entitled this talk and

100
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,239
oath to pragmatism

101
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
across disciplines and i hope at the end

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,920
you understand

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,519
why that is so

104
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
um i've been interested in contacts uh

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,040
contact networks infectious disease

106
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
spread over contacts for a long time

107
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,319
ten years ago this was one of the first

108
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,439
studies that we did

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,680
on actually measuring also these contact

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,400
networks we used wireless sensor

111
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,239
network technology at the time we

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,000
couldn't quite you know leverage

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
uh super widespread um smartphone use at

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,280
the time

115
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
but it sort of indicates right sort of

116
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,319
an ongoing

117
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,279
approach with technology to really

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,320
figure out

119
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,160
the details of these networks

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,000
understanding their importance

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,479
in infectious disease spread i always

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,199
point to the social patterns website

123
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
by some colleagues in italy and france

124
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,600
and other countries

125
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,440
where you can find dozens of such

126
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,080
deployments as examples

127
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,680
now in the wake of sarskowi

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,520
ii and covet it became clear that

129
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
these contacts are incredibly important

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
that's after all

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
the sort of pathways along which the

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
disease can spread

133
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,400
and it was important for us to be able

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,560
to help manual contact tracing

135
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,720
with technology because we understood

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
early on

137
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
the importance of contact tracing of

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,720
testing

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,440
contact tracing isolation and quarantine

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
the challenge of course with this

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,479
particular bug is that

142
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,479
people can be infectious before they're

143
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,960
symptomatic

144
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,800
and so if you focus only on

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
isolating symptomatic people

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,919
here you know denoted in the dark reds

147
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,400
then

148
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
that's of course fine because those

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
people cannot

150
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,560
um at that stage in fact further but

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,199
they have

152
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,240
already infected others and so if you

153
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
only ever focus on symptomatic people

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
you're always running one step behind

155
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
that's why it's important to have a very

156
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,000
rapid

157
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,280
contact tracing so that you can also

158
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,800
quarantine people

159
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,080
who have been exposed so the rapidity is

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,240
of enormous interest in you know if

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
technology can help with one thing

162
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
i think it's with speed and that's

163
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,039
you know a better model than the

164
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,360
alternative model which is non-targeted

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,479
quarantine

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,720
aka lockdowns where everybody has to

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,840
stay at home

168
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
because everybody's sort of under

169
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
general suspicion of having

170
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,759
been exposed to this virus in one way or

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,600
another i think it's intuitively clear

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
that this would be

173
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,759
the better approach so early on

174
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,360
in the winter still of 2020 we formed

175
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,080
the group

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,120
that we called pep pt this was with a

177
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,680
couple of european colleagues

178
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,759
so we named it pan-european privacy

179
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,919
preserving proximity tracing

180
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,840
to make clear that we want this to work

181
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,759
across borders and that

182
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,840
it should have a very decent privacy

183
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
preservation built in

184
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,199
but very rapidly due to disagreements

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,639
on transparency vis-a-vis the public

186
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,759
and on this notion of

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,560
centralized versus decentralized ways to

188
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
go about doing this

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,440
a couple of us split up uh split off a

190
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,319
group

191
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,560
uh called dp3t which stands for

192
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,319
decentralized privacy preserving

193
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,599
proximity tracing

194
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,160
and we were interested to be completely

195
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,199
transparent

196
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,919
you know github and so on from day one

197
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,160
the decentralized approach eventually

198
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
as everyone knows made it into the

199
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,880
exposure notification framework by apple

200
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
and google

201
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
and uh we managed to launch the swiss

202
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,000
code app

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,919
shortly thereafter it was the first

204
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,039
national

205
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
government app that was based on

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,280
exposure notification

207
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
to launch and we also had a legal basis

208
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,520
approved by parliament which i think was

209
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
very nice

210
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
now my learnings from that time is that

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,599
digital proximity tracing is a classical

212
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,240
case

213
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
of a challenge that the future

214
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,800
will hand us multiple times namely

215
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,039
that you need both expertise in the

216
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,000
technology but

217
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
also the relevant domain which in this

218
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,319
case was epidemiology

219
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,080
i've seen a lot of other groups who

220
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
worked on the same

221
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,479
problem where i often felt

222
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,319
they were lacking deep expertise in one

223
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,360
um of these areas and that sometimes

224
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,960
was a roadblock and at epiphan we were

225
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,000
lucky because

226
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,030
we had been building the

227
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,400
[Music]

228
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,080
transdisciplinary dna of the project

229
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,039
already way before covet and i usually

230
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,799
describe this with bridges right you

231
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,320
have to build bridges between the

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,440
disciplines

233
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,839
but you can't build those bridges during

234
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,919
the crisis certainly not during a

235
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,880
rapidly

236
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
unfolding crisis like the covet pandemic

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,839
you need to build them before so that

238
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
when the crisis hits

239
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
you can just walk over that bridge

240
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
this turns out to be a harder problem

241
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,560
than most

242
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
appreciate as a digital epidemiologist i

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,480
mean it's in

244
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,519
in my job title the transdisciplinary

245
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,200
nature of the work

246
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,959
and so it's something i've thought quite

247
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,880
a bit about for many years

248
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,200
and i've observed that there's broad

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
agreement

250
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,440
that this transdisciplinary nature is of

251
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
critical importance

252
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
and in some sense even the future of

253
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,680
science but the academic system has a

254
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,959
very hard time

255
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,040
setting up the right structure and

256
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,240
certainly also setting up the right

257
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,839
incentive structure

258
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,160
for that to happen easily there are

259
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,120
still very few

260
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
journals who you know that that are that

261
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
are really sort of focusing on this type

262
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,720
of work

263
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,000
there's still very few grants there are

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,640
still

265
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,360
few academic prices you know all of

266
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
these things that are important

267
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,880
um in the academic you know

268
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
infrastructure

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,880
that make it then very hard right for

270
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
people to really have the right

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,160
incentives to embark on that kind of

272
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,200
work

273
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,920
and i think part of the core problem

274
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,640
actually is that

275
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,120
it is truly difficult because you do

276
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,959
need expertise in

277
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
in multiple areas and and all of us um

278
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
you know who work in one area know how

279
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
hard it is to keep up in our own

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,440
area let alone than in multiple ones

281
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
and so the work also only gets reviewed

282
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,360
by people with expertise only in one

283
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,320
area

284
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,079
and that makes the whole thing even more

285
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,920
complicated

286
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,600
um now to finish something that

287
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,839
i've also noticed and that's even

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,160
perhaps the bigger problem is not only

289
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,480
to

290
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,560
to then build the bridges so that you

291
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
can make this work happen

292
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
but how it's then accepted also by the

293
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,519
academic

294
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,040
community and by others um for example

295
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
when it comes to digital proximity

296
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
tracing there was this strong

297
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
sense that there a very strong negative

298
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
trade-off between

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,480
the preservation of privacy or the

300
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
epidemiological impact right where the

301
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
notion was well either you built an app

302
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
with which you can really tackle this

303
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
pandemic but then you have to throw

304
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,519
privacy out the window or you

305
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,079
make it so privacy preserving that it

306
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
has no epidemiological impact

307
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
and i think part of that is based on

308
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
this myth that you always need more data

309
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
to solve the problem which i think is a

310
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
widespread myth in epidemiology

311
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,959
certainly more data can help but first

312
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,320
you should also ask yourself

313
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
how much can you solve the problem

314
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,040
without even collecting the data

315
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,440
and so i think if you have this line in

316
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,959
mind and you think that's just

317
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,480
what it is then i think you're you're

318
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
not thinking in a way that would be

319
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
possible which i think is this

320
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,320
where you really try to leverage

321
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,240
technology to the maximum

322
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,240
extent possible to bend this curve

323
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,279
this trade-off curve because when you if

324
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,560
you manage to bend it

325
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,360
in such a way and i think we did then

326
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,399
you can actually find

327
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
points on this trade-off curve that

328
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
represent a good pragmatic compromise

329
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,800
right between these two

330
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
views of looking at the world and i

331
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
think that's what dp3t was i think

332
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,399
that's what

333
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
the exposure notification framework

334
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,440
ended up being

335
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,160
it was sort of a solid you know real

336
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,800
world

337
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,839
compromise between acceptable

338
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,720
privacy risks and strong potential

339
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,160
epidemiological

340
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,200
impact which i think is great but we

341
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
didn't notice that

342
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,680
um we were actually or these ideas were

343
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,519
attacked quite heavily

344
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
from people just looking through one

345
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,800
lens

346
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,720
at the problem so you could of course

347
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
then argue well you know this point of

348
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
the curve i'm not happy with because

349
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,120
this is not the best solution from a

350
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
privacy perspective

351
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,160
um or it is not the best solution

352
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,720
from an epidemiological perspective but

353
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,440
that'll

354
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,560
ignores of course the reality that there

355
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
is a trade-off at the end of the day and

356
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,000
so

357
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,079
that was difficult and i think it it

358
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,360
reflected that

359
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,639
lack of a of a transdisciplinary culture

360
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,120
um across academia and that we really

361
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
need to tackle

362
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,920
so if anything this talk is a

363
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,720
really a plea for all of us to be more

364
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,600
serious about transdisciplinary work

365
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
for academia also an industry to get its

366
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,000
incentive structure right

367
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
because if we do that then first of all

368
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
we can walk over bridges when we need

369
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,399
them instead of having to spend time to

370
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,279
build them

371
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
and then when we find solutions that

372
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
there's a clear understanding

373
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
that these are pragmatic solutions that

374
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
are also necessary in the short term

375
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,720
and we don't lose time in these types of

376
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
fights

377
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
of not being absolutely perfect in one

378
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,920
or another dimension

379
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,000
so that's it from eyesight i'm looking

380
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
forward to

381
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
the discussion and thank you very much

382
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
for your attention

383
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,839
hello my name is ali lang i work on the

384
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,600
public policy team at google

385
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,279
and i'm going to talk today about the

386
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,120
google apple exposure notification

387
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,079
system

388
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,600
i'm not going to explain too much about

389
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,519
how the technology works um i think

390
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,360
there's a pretty good sense at this

391
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,839
point

392
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
um but there is a lot of really good

393
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
explanatory material online on our

394
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,120
website and otherwise

395
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,839
if people need more information instead

396
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,440
i wanted to spend some time sort of

397
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
giving a behind the scenes look at what

398
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,199
it was like to answer the question

399
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,360
how can a mobile phone help and to find

400
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,600
a global pandemic

401
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,519
of course i am only one person and i'm

402
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,199
going to talk about this from my point

403
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:33,839
of view

404
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,279
um as someone who worked on a couple of

405
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
relevant projects but literally hundreds

406
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,199
of people worked on the things that i'm

407
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,399
going to talk about

408
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,800
um and please know that this is not the

409
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,000
whole story is just my

410
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,399
story um the other pieces i'll pretty

411
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,760
much be talking through the timeline

412
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
from a u.s point of view

413
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,959
but understand that things were

414
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,880
different in other places so that's not

415
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,600
meant to be

416
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,040
rude speaking of which i'm going to

417
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,199
start the story on march 9th

418
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,279
march 9th was the first day i did not go

419
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,560
into the google office

420
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
um i should note that many of our global

421
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
colleagues were already working from

422
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
home at that point

423
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
um and my strongest memory of these

424
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,920
first days of being home is this graphic

425
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,279
do you remember this graphic

426
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,880
um i wanted to remind us all with those

427
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
first few weeks of like uh

428
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,880
of of being home we're like um in the

429
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,560
flat in the curve graphic was everywhere

430
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,480
you went

431
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,079
also during this time period there were

432
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,680
a lot of questions around the role

433
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
technology could or should play in the

434
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,959
response to the pandemic

435
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
one of the most prominent ones as far as

436
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
the privacy debate was about location

437
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,440
data

438
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
so within a few weeks there was a big

439
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
question in the united states of whether

440
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,279
the tech industry should be helping

441
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,519
contribute mobile data or help to give

442
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,360
information from location for mobile

443
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,320
data

444
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,480
to help respond to the pandemic this has

445
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,160
already been a big topic of conversation

446
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,759
in other countries around the world

447
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,199
you see a couple examples here on the

448
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,959
bottom and governments had made

449
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,160
different decisions about

450
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,759
what kinds of data could help how to

451
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,199
apply it how to get it

452
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,800
um but this was sort of the hot ticket

453
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
privacy debate in those early days at

454
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
least from my point of view

455
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,199
so within this time period google

456
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,720
actually put out a statement about how

457
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
we were thinking about um

458
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,959
whether location data could be useful by

459
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,639
the time the washington post article was

460
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,160
published on march 17th

461
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,639
we had already been doing a lot of work

462
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,240
exploring this question we were already

463
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,839
in the process of

464
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,320
kind of figuring out how to use our data

465
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,600
and we hadn't talked about it with the

466
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,480
government

467
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
like the post said but we released a

468
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
statement to help clarify

469
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,279
and as you'll see in our quote our

470
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,800
instinct was to look at aggregate

471
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,399
patterns of movement from the data that

472
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,680
we had

473
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,600
so on april 3rd we had published the

474
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,199
community mobility reports

475
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,880
these are actually still available today

476
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,079
they're really really interesting i

477
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,120
highly recommend

478
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
checking them out they present aggregate

479
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
information on how patterns of movement

480
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
have changed

481
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,920
so are more people going to the grocery

482
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,639
stores than we would typically expect

483
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,399
the information is useful for public

484
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,680
health authorities to help them

485
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,600
understand how social distancing was

486
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,399
impacting

487
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,040
patterns of movement the reports provide

488
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
the same type of

489
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
aggregate anonymous insights that we use

490
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
in google maps for example to power

491
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,480
popular times or business features

492
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,839
and the data is only collected from

493
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,599
users who've opted into a specific

494
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,039
location feature

495
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,720
and then on top of that these reports

496
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,400
have extensive privacy protections

497
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,199
including

498
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,119
some pretty good differential privacy

499
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,160
and there's actually a lot of really

500
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
good documentation about all of that

501
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,199
that i recommend you check out if you're

502
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,280
curious um but i just wanted to set this

503
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
context

504
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,640
during the same period of time that we

505
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,400
were working on the reports

506
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,679
researchers and governments around the

507
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,760
world were really expanding their notion

508
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,440
of how phones could be applied to

509
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,039
support contact racing

510
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,799
and the idea of using location data was

511
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,400
starting to fall out of favor

512
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
so instead people started to talk about

513
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,600
bluetooth low energy

514
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
and how this technology could help and

515
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,679
within a few weeks from that late march

516
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,000
early

517
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
april period a number of researchers and

518
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
experts released reports

519
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,039
code even working apps that use

520
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,640
bluetooth low energy to help

521
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,559
detect proximity for purposes of contact

522
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,000
racing

523
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,679
um but these early implementations were

524
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
facing a lot of challenges as they were

525
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
deploying the novel technology and it

526
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
became clear that the mobile operating

527
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,840
systems

528
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,600
needed to make some technical changes to

529
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,200
fully support the effort

530
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,280
so for example interoperability between

531
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
the platforms between android and iphone

532
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,160
was not

533
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
very reliable there were some battery

534
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
issues and there were some issues like

535
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
you'll see reflected on the screen

536
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
around having to keep the app in the

537
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
foreground

538
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,559
so there were calls for google and apple

539
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,840
to help with this and with other

540
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,559
things at that time

541
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
and so on april 10th we announced a

542
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,160
partnership between google and apple

543
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,600
it was announced to help address these

544
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,760
issues so by collaborating together

545
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600
we could provide a more reliable

546
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
functionality to this technology

547
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,280
address some fragmentation that was

548
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,120
appearing in the market and create a

549
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
common and really high baseline privacy

550
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,799
and security standard

551
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
so this collaboration was intended to

552
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,000
make the phones work the way

553
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,360
those researchers and people who are

554
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,440
developing these bluetooth low energy

555
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
um apps intended and hopefully support a

556
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,480
great tool to stop the spread

557
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,919
so it's worth noting that this april

558
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,320
10th announcement was not a launch

559
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,160
it was just the news of a partnership um

560
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
and the amount of work that was still

561
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
ahead at that point was very daunting

562
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
and announcing the project before we'd

563
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
finish building the tech put a lot of

564
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,559
pressure on both companies

565
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,160
this project condensed what would have

566
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,480
been months of work into a few weeks um

567
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,240
people were working really really long

568
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,840
days through weekends and often in

569
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,200
addition to their day jobs to help

570
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,640
contribute to the effort

571
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
it was a tense and a really exciting

572
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,559
time for um for people who like to

573
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,559
solve challenging problems and it was

574
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,880
definitely a really

575
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,280
intense time period

576
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,679
um also to help navigate this time

577
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,280
period because of how we had structured

578
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,240
the rollout

579
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,840
there was this time between we announced

580
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,200
the partnership and when we were

581
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,799
actually going to launch the technology

582
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,160
and this was one of the more challenging

583
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,960
phases to

584
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
navigate so during this time you may

585
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,039
recall we actually renamed

586
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,640
the type of thing we were trying to do

587
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
from contact raising to exposure

588
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,200
notification

589
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,559
i thought that was really a more

590
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,159
accurate reflection of what we were

591
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:02,640
doing

592
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,559
um a more accurate understanding of the

593
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,240
role the technology was going to play

594
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,080
which was to enhance contact tracing and

595
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
not replace it

596
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,200
we also published the terms of service

597
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,039
um the developers had to agree to to use

598
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:13,840
the api

599
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
this included several restrictions that

600
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,120
ensured really high standards for

601
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,240
privacy

602
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
and during this period there was a

603
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,360
public debate in europe about the best

604
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
way to design the technology

605
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
it was really interesting and so then we

606
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,360
got to may where we finally launched

607
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,840
the technology the thing that stands out

608
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
to me most from this period of time was

609
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,360
how we were thinking about privacy

610
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,520
in the project we really considered

611
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,960
privacy protections to be

612
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
essential to the success of the project

613
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
we believed that people would not use

614
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,159
the system or wouldn't use it faithfully

615
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,360
they wouldn't have the settings correct

616
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,480
on their phone or wouldn't carry their

617
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,520
phone with them

618
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
if they didn't trust it so that became a

619
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,360
really strong guiding principle how can

620
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,320
you make this a

621
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,960
zero risk privacy proposition and this

622
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,480
is one of the reasons we supplemented

623
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,159
the technical safeguards with such a

624
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,760
strong terms of service at this time

625
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,720
after the api was formally launched

626
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
government started launching apps they

627
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,760
used it and it was really exciting

628
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,679
by the end of july public health

629
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,600
authorities had launched apps with this

630
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,600
technology in 16 countries and regions

631
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,880
all over the world

632
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,480
and the association of public health

633
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,000
laboratories had agreed to host

634
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,159
a u.s wide server to support interstate

635
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,200
operability

636
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
there were roughly 20 states working on

637
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,559
developing apps at the technology at

638
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,760
this time so

639
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,520
what ap hl did was really instrumental

640
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:27,919
because

641
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,520
those apps need to be able to work on

642
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,200
people across state borders

643
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,880
we were also continuously improving the

644
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,720
bluetooth technology for example at the

645
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,400
end of july we launched an update that

646
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,440
improved the calibration

647
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,840
in the same period of time we

648
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,760
extensively expanded our documentation

649
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,880
on the developer site

650
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,240
we improved our public facing

651
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,919
explanations and materials we added

652
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,280
videos and easy to understand

653
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,400
explanations

654
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,320
i've been really invested in making

655
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,000
those tools and those services more

656
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,159
understandable

657
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,520
throughout this period based on our

658
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,720
conversations with public health

659
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,240
authorities we had sort of a growing

660
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,120
understanding

661
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
that it was very challenging for them to

662
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,159
develop these apps

663
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,600
so in september we launched something

664
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,440
called exposure notifications express

665
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
in the united states to help lighten the

666
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,880
loads on the government it's more of a

667
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,559
building block system to launching an

668
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,039
app

669
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,960
um and this really accelerated launches

670
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,320
in the u.s

671
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
so basically in the six-month time

672
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,840
period that you see reflect on your

673
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,400
screen

674
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
um the project was able to develop a

675
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
technology that reliably works on both

676
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
mobile operating systems

677
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
partner with governments all over the

678
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
world to launch this technology in a way

679
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,880
that keeps public health and focus

680
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
and protect people's privacy and

681
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,799
ultimately to support the copit response

682
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,840
this is a very intense six months

683
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,000
so where are we today public health

684
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
authorities have launched apps in more

685
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,840
than 55 countries states or regions

686
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
which is about an average of two watches

687
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
per week which is very very impressive

688
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,559
um in terms of just getting technology

689
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,400
out the door we were also really honored

690
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,760
to win innovation of the year from

691
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,120
popular science

692
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,559
and part of their commentary was

693
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,320
on our privacy and security standards

694
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,000
that was really an exciting

695
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,520
recognition we've had some really good

696
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
success stories these examples really

697
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,440
show how we know the app is helping

698
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,120
specifically it shows that it's helping

699
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,640
expose people get tested and it's

700
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,400
helping contact tracing

701
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,240
um expand its reach and those were two

702
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,440
of the key things we wanted the

703
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,559
technology to do

704
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,159
so this is good what are some things we

705
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,400
learned along the way

706
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,720
so switching from contact racing to

707
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,400
exposure notification really helped

708
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,039
clarify

709
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,200
our role in the response um it was a

710
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
little bit challenging to do that's the

711
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
kind of thing that might typically

712
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,159
be more behind the scenes but it was a

713
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,760
really important thing for us to do

714
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,840
and it was a really critical change that

715
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,200
we made so that was

716
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,440
a good decision we also learned that

717
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,120
governments needed more support

718
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,640
which is where exposure notification

719
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,039
express came in and google also made ad

720
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,400
grants available and other tools for

721
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,640
governments to help promote their apps

722
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
we learned that proactive communication

723
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,080
on privacy and phone settings was

724
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,200
essential

725
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,960
helping people understand how the

726
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,799
technology worked was really challenging

727
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
because it really was entirely novel

728
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
and so there weren't a lot of really

729
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,640
clear things to compare it to

730
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,039
it's not like a lot of other things so

731
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,120
the work we did to create videos to

732
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
create more understandable materials

733
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
was really an important step in this

734
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,679
process we also had some moments where

735
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,360
um there were some myths that were going

736
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,159
around

737
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
about this being automatically installed

738
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,919
on your phone um and so we worked with

739
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,039
third-party chat

740
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,640
fact checking organizations around the

741
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,600
world to help um ease those myths

742
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,960
we learned that transparency was

743
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,279
essential so making the code open source

744
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,039
also the transparency of showing up and

745
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,480
having conversations with people

746
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,880
um things like changing the name doing

747
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,279
those things kind of out in the open

748
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,720
were really important to the success of

749
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
the project

750
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
we also learned to be humble we engaged

751
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
in a lot of conversations where we were

752
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,520
not the experts in the room

753
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,440
our goal was really always to bring our

754
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,679
core competencies to the table um to

755
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,039
make sure that our focus was on the

756
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,720
things we do best and make sure we were

757
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,480
supporting the people who knew best how

758
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
to help with the pandemic

759
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,520
and the last thing i would say we

760
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,120
learned was not to give up there were a

761
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
lot of moments where this felt like it

762
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,640
might be impossible where we faced a lot

763
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,679
of really difficult

764
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,480
um conversations and challenges um

765
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,320
around the world and yet i think we were

766
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
able to navigate pretty well

767
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,400
those challenges and the technology is

768
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
pretty widely launched and available

769
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,200
today

770
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,880
so thank you so much for having me at

771
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,960
this event and i look forward to having

772
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,480
a conversation with our co-panelists

773
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,919
hi everyone thanks for joining us to

774
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,120
talk today about

775
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,000
privacy issues with coronavirus contact

776
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,360
racing apps

777
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,400
i'm tiffany lee and i am a law professor

778
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,120
at boston university school of law i'm

779
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,080
also a fellow

780
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,320
at yale law school's information society

781
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,279
project

782
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,120
and i write a recurring column on

783
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
technology and privacy

784
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,480
for msnbc so i've been thinking about

785
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,279
this topic

786
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,679
quite a lot as you can expect it's a bit

787
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,440
like that old saying right

788
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,360
uh if all you have is a hammer

789
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,279
everything looks like a nail

790
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,480
for me as a privacy researcher

791
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,320
when i first started thinking about

792
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
these contact tracing apps

793
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,279
all i saw were the privacy problems uh

794
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,600
that's not to say i don't use one though

795
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,320
i currently have the contact tracing

796
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,559
capability turned on on my phone

797
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,960
and i encourage everybody i know in

798
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,760
specific states to turn that on as well

799
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,400
and why specific states we'll get into

800
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,919
that a little bit later

801
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,480
some of you may already know the answer

802
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
and here is when i would see if anyone

803
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,159
in the audience is raising their hands

804
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,760
but as this is the recorded part of the

805
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,919
conversation i'm just going to assume

806
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,520
that everyone is sort of nodding along

807
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,760
and smiling

808
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,200
so today i'm going to talk a little bit

809
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
about the privacy and legal risks

810
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,919
involved with the contact tracing apps

811
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,080
and we'll go over a few different things

812
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
so first i want to situate us so we

813
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,440
understand what we're talking about and

814
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,000
have a common ground of understanding

815
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
next i'll look into some of the privacy

816
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,360
risks involved with these apps

817
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,919
both the manual contact tracing as well

818
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,880
as digital

819
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,799
and then looking at decentralized and

820
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,600
centralized contact tracing apps

821
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,559
then i'll look at the legal landscape as

822
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,480
an attorney and a law professor

823
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,400
i'll explain some of the legal issues

824
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,520
involved with

825
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,480
privacy and contact tracing applications

826
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,360
and finally

827
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,200
i'll give you a few suggestions for how

828
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,960
i think we should move forward

829
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
thinking about how to protect our

830
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,039
privacy in a time of pandemic

831
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,080
or really any time at all

832
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,399
so first what are we talking about here

833
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,480
a few other speakers on this panel

834
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,960
have talked to you or will talk to you

835
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,880
about different types of contact tracing

836
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,840
protocols

837
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,360
they've probably mentioned the specific

838
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,279
privacy preserving techniques

839
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,679
that some companies and some firms have

840
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,559
been using

841
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,919
for example the apple and google

842
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,000
exposure notification tool

843
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
this tool is of course probably the most

844
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
privacy preserving type that we could

845
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,360
think about

846
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,760
and it's been implemented across various

847
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,720
states in the us

848
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,000
and in different countries around the

849
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,840
world as part of contact tracing apps

850
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,559
contact racing apps are often used to

851
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,360
supplement

852
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,320
but not to replace manual contact juicy

853
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,240
and by manual contact tracing i just

854
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,880
mean

855
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,840
a human being calling you asking if you

856
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
had coronavirus

857
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,279
and then asking about every single

858
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,960
person you may have contacted

859
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,679
within the potential infectious period

860
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,679
so in lieu of that we have these digital

861
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,880
apps

862
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,240
now i think the first thing we have to

863
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,120
recognize is that

864
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,200
for all of us as technologists and as

865
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,120
technology researchers

866
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,679
we may have gotten a bit too excited

867
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,279
about the contact racing apps in the

868
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,399
beginning

869
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,799
certainly they are exciting in terms of

870
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,080
the technology and the potential

871
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,240
but in reality we haven't really seen

872
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,159
them being implemented at a scale

873
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,320
to which i would say these apps have

874
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
really made a huge difference

875
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,039
and we'll talk about why that is so

876
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:57,600
first

877
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
let's look at the privacy risks involved

878
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,600
with these apps and there are obviously

879
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,320
very many risks anytime you collect data

880
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,360
of any kind

881
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,039
you have risks involved with that data

882
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,640
collection the data processing the

883
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
sharing the storage the deletion

884
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
and so on and so forth specifically here

885
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
we have an issue in terms of who is

886
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,159
actually collecting the data

887
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
and who has access to the data now one

888
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,279
reason why we haven't seen

889
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,480
as much user adoption of these

890
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,159
even the privacy preserving contact

891
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,559
tracing apps is that very often people

892
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,279
just don't

893
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,880
trust either the government or companies

894
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,360
to store their data so when they hear

895
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,320
for example

896
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,640
that the state public health department

897
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,720
has partnered with apple and google to

898
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,399
create a new app

899
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,840
some people might not think that that's

900
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,279
an app they actually want to download

901
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,399
and use

902
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,960
and that's a problem if we believe that

903
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,039
contact tracing apps are important in

904
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,559
solving the pandemic

905
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,880
or in helping us for future types of

906
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,840
pandemics

907
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,360
or for future types of disease

908
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,760
surveillance we need to solve that core

909
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,279
trust issue and one way to do that

910
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,559
is by using privacy preserving protocols

911
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,440
so i'm very happy to see that we've seen

912
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
decentralized contact tracing

913
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,080
applications

914
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,880
we've seen privacy preserving proposals

915
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,520
we've seen

916
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,760
a lot of states even working on apps

917
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,320
that try to do the best they can to make

918
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,840
sure that data isn't

919
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,720
abused or unauthorized or accessed in an

920
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,360
unauthorized manner

921
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,120
this is important because there are many

922
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,039
risks to the data being collected

923
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,320
in contact tracing applications first of

924
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,799
all there is the major risk of this data

925
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,200
being

926
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,919
accessed by unauthorized actors there's

927
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,919
always a risk of hacking

928
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,399
no matter how secure your app or your

929
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,360
company is

930
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,039
i think everybody at this conference

931
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,399
knows that

932
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,559
so that's one major risk to always think

933
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,080
about whenever we have some

934
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,520
application that's collecting a lot of

935
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,000
data particularly the very sensitive

936
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
type of health data

937
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,240
that these apps might be collecting we

938
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,679
also have to think about potential

939
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,039
misuse of data

940
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,880
and this could be a misuse of data from

941
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,640
authorized actors

942
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,399
of course many people around the world

943
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,320
have talked about government misuse of

944
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,120
data

945
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,360
and that's something to consider as well

946
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,519
for example recently singapore got into

947
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,880
a bit of hot water

948
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,960
when the government admitted that the

949
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,880
data collected in their contact tracing

950
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,360
app

951
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,120
could be used for government other

952
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,200
government purposes including potential

953
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
criminal justice or law enforcement

954
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,399
purposes

955
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,720
now this is highly problematic first

956
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
because this disincentivizes people from

957
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,240
using and downloading the app

958
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,919
which definitely harms the purpose of

959
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,840
those apps and actually helping create

960
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,760
better disease surveillance

961
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,000
but second that's problematic because

962
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,240
this conflation of types of data

963
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
and types of actors who can access data

964
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,880
can harm our civil liberties

965
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,640
it's harmful the government can access

966
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,880
data without limitations and without

967
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,159
transparency

968
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,600
and there's always potential that

969
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,440
governments may misuse their access to

970
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,080
data

971
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,919
and misuse the data collected by these

972
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,000
contact tracing apps

973
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,720
so that's always a problem there are

974
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,480
other problems involved as well

975
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,320
now of course there's a problem of not

976
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
only hacking and potential misuse of

977
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,960
data

978
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,880
but also what happens after the data is

979
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,919
released if we for example note that

980
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,519
certain people at a certain company

981
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,440
tested positive for current virus

982
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,840
there's potential for harassment stigma

983
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,960
doxxing

984
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,840
all of those different privacy invasion

985
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,000
harms

986
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,480
there are also equity concerns if we

987
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
promote a privacy preserving contact

988
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,559
tracing application

989
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,000
that might be enough to get user

990
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,840
adoption for some people

991
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,279
but we have to recognize that the

992
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,840
privacy harms of unauthorized access to

993
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,480
data

994
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,240
or if government or corporate abuse of

995
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,960
data those harms can be much worse for

996
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,679
certain marginalized communities

997
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,519
in that case those communities would not

998
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,440
be able to benefit from

999
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
whatever health benefits you might see

1000
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
from the contact racing applications

1001
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,600
leading to a greater divide in terms of

1002
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,159
digital equity

1003
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,039
so there are many privacy risks but we

1004
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,840
also have some potential legal solutions

1005
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,919
now first there is much discussion about

1006
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,000
hipaa the health insurance portability

1007
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,519
and accountability act

1008
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,840
hipaa however is a little bit limited

1009
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
while it does protect the

1010
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,519
privacy of transmission of specific

1011
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,200
types of health data

1012
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
it only does so between specific parties

1013
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,799
so covered healthcare

1014
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,600
entities like hospitals and clinics

1015
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,159
there isn't

1016
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,519
as much of a focus or a regulatory

1017
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,960
enforcement ability

1018
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,640
for the collection of this type of data

1019
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
from private parties

1020
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,279
and similarly if you think about the

1021
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,320
third-party

1022
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,799
application developers there's also

1023
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,720
sometimes a lack of enforcement

1024
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,519
ability on the part of google and apple

1025
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,120
in terms of really cracking down on

1026
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,559
every single app that third-party

1027
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,399
developers create

1028
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,159
so we have to think about those problems

1029
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,600
as well in terms of regulatory solutions

1030
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
there are additional laws that apply

1031
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,039
there are data breach notification laws

1032
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,240
that apply

1033
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,200
if there is if there is a hack for any

1034
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,799
contact tracing application

1035
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,760
or any server storing the information

1036
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
which of course is much more harmful

1037
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,918
in the case of a centralized contact

1038
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,119
using application

1039
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,639
or one that doesn't use a privacy

1040
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,879
preserving bluetooth standard

1041
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,960
so there are these issues that the laws

1042
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,399
tries to

1043
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,639
help with but can't really fully protect

1044
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,520
against

1045
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,760
for example database notification laws

1046
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,839
we have a 50-state approach

1047
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,079
but that really only helps you after the

1048
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,399
fact that helps you after your data has

1049
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,440
already been

1050
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,679
accessed by unauthorized parties or

1051
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,639
exposed or leaked out to the public

1052
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,000
there are a few other laws that also

1053
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,320
apply we have additional federal

1054
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,560
and state level health privacy laws

1055
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,399
including for example the 21st century

1056
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,399
cares act

1057
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,639
and we also have a category of law that

1058
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,839
just protects

1059
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,480
users as consumers so consumer

1060
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,520
protection laws

1061
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,280
can be used to protect consumers using

1062
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,440
applications that may be developed even

1063
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,599
by non-public authorities

1064
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,440
so private parties who develop these

1065
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,800
contact tracing apps

1066
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,599
would have to fall under for example the

1067
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,720
enforcement ability

1068
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,880
of the federal trade commission which

1069
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,720
makes sure that apps

1070
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,119
and companies can't for example do

1071
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,040
things like make misleading statements

1072
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,920
about privacy or cyber security

1073
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,079
so that's all well and good but that

1074
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
doesn't do enough

1075
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,640
we don't really have privacy for the

1076
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,040
data that we put in these apps

1077
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
when we don't have that because the

1078
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,240
greatest harm of all isn't something i

1079
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,560
think is related to the legal issues

1080
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,240
or even to the issues we've discussed

1081
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,000
about unauthorized access

1082
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,079
about government abuse data about

1083
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,000
potential hacking and so on

1084
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
i think the greatest privacy problem we

1085
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,560
have with contact racing applications

1086
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,480
is simply that they create a shift in

1087
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,359
our privacy norms

1088
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,079
the greater use of these applications as

1089
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,359
well as a greater use of health

1090
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,960
surveillance generally throughout this

1091
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,320
pandemic

1092
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
has the potential to change the way we

1093
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,400
think about health privacy

1094
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,640
so we start thinking that it's normal to

1095
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,520
always have an

1096
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,839
app on your phone created by the

1097
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,079
government that tracks your location

1098
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,400
all throughout the day now of course we

1099
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,839
know that there are some seats that have

1100
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,079
implemented the more privacy preserving

1101
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,000
bluetooth based decentralized contact

1102
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,359
tracing applications

1103
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,599
and that is fantastic and should be

1104
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,800
applauded

1105
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,280
but not all states have done this it's

1106
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,119
very possible that other nations

1107
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,200
as well have been using a more

1108
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,720
traditional location tracking paradigm

1109
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,320
overall what's important is that the

1110
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,920
consumer doesn't really know the

1111
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
difference

1112
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,520
and because we don't know the difference

1113
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,359
what's really happening is that people

1114
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,599
in america and around the world

1115
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,640
are becoming more used to having their

1116
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,920
data being collected

1117
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,040
generally it becomes more normalized for

1118
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,920
governments

1119
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
and for corporations to have access to

1120
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,520
vast quantities of sensitive health data

1121
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,119
and we have some laws that protect

1122
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,960
against this for example the health

1123
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,680
privacy laws i mentioned united states

1124
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,960
under the gdpr and other privacy laws

1125
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,680
around the world

1126
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,079
health privacy or health data is often

1127
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,599
treated as a sensitive category of

1128
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,119
information

1129
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,200
but it doesn't do enough we need

1130
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,800
stronger laws and we need

1131
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,599
better overall societal understanding of

1132
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,440
what health privacy is and why it

1133
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,720
matters

1134
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,400
we also need this understanding because

1135
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,920
health privacy

1136
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,160
is sometimes even more important or more

1137
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,320
critical than other forms of privacy

1138
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,280
in terms of information privacy there is

1139
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,400
also the old saying

1140
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,760
that um you know biometrics ought to be

1141
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,079
user names not passwords

1142
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,839
because you can never really change your

1143
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,240
face but similarly you can't change your

1144
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
dna

1145
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,400
you can't change the health information

1146
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,160
that is collected about you at a certain

1147
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,720
time

1148
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,400
whether or not you've had chronic virus

1149
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,920
in the past whether or not you have

1150
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,520
pre-existing conditions

1151
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,920
all that information is unique to you

1152
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,520
and extremely important for

1153
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
multiple facets of your life as a person

1154
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,359
in society

1155
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,200
and for these reasons i think the

1156
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,800
privacy and legal issues involve the

1157
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,160
coronavirus testing

1158
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,720
and coronavirus tracing apps aren't

1159
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,880
limited to simply the issues in terms of

1160
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,440
what the technology can do but what we

1161
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,640
really have to think about

1162
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,119
is how to protect privacy moving forward

1163
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,440
and how to shift those norms of privacy

1164
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,000
back

1165
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
so we can protect ourselves not only now

1166
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
but after the pandemic

1167
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,160
and after the next one and after the

1168
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,079
next one after that

1169
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,400
so thank you very much for listening and

1170
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,839
i'm looking forward to our panel

1171
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,320
discussion

1172
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,200
good morning my name is mike judd i'm an

1173
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,119
epidemiologist and computer scientist at

1174
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,400
the cdc

1175
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,320
and i do lead a collaboration between

1176
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,560
the agency-wide copit19 emergency

1177
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,839
response

1178
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,520
and the office of the chief information

1179
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,000
officer known as the kobit 19

1180
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,480
exposure notification initiative i'm

1181
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
grateful for the opportunity to share my

1182
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,160
perspective this morning alongside my

1183
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,640
distinguished colleagues

1184
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
in the next 10 minutes i want to discuss

1185
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
interdisciplinary problem solving

1186
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,359
and explore the nature and value of the

1187
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,040
relationships that have been formed

1188
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,320
within and between

1189
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
the public health community and the tech

1190
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,000
sector since the beginning

1191
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,040
of the coca-19 pandemic i'll highlight

1192
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,880
the innovations these relationships have

1193
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,079
produced

1194
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
and how these innovations have led to

1195
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
some early successes in state-led

1196
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,040
implementations

1197
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,640
of the google and apple exposure

1198
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,759
notification system

1199
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
first many of these relationships are

1200
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,560
new and building them has required a

1201
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,200
mindful

1202
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,599
trusting approach to unite these largely

1203
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,599
independent communities

1204
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,440
promoting an inclusive environment has

1205
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,200
led to the blurring of boundaries

1206
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,599
between public health and technology and

1207
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,359
serve to facilitate the innovations

1208
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,839
achieved

1209
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,079
to put this all a bit more simply it

1210
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,599
takes a village

1211
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,839
public health practitioners governments

1212
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,280
and public figures

1213
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,119
often lead in the implementation of

1214
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,880
non-pharmaceutical interventions for

1215
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
infectious disease outbreaks

1216
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
but exposure notification is different

1217
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,200
and requires a unique community

1218
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,760
of practice to be implemented public

1219
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
health can't do it without technologists

1220
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,359
and technologists can't do it without

1221
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,280
public health

1222
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,599
parochialism both at an organizational

1223
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,720
level and within

1224
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,359
and across technical domains can prevent

1225
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,200
the kind of cross-pollination

1226
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
needed to address unprecedented

1227
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,920
challenges like the kobit-19 pandemic

1228
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,079
therefore the cdc and our early

1229
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:34,960
collaborators

1230
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,800
like the association of public health

1231
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,720

foundation public health

1234
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,359
sought to establish a community of

1235
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,359
practice to provide states

1236
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,079
territories and university systems with

1237
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,000
the interdisciplinary support

1238
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
needed to implement innovative solutions

1239
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,720
to mitigating the pandemic

1240
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,640
in dark blue you see the jurisdictions

1241
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,000
we've worked with

1242
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,079
they include those curious about

1243
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,920
developing or in production with a

1244
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,920
solution leveraging the google apple

1245
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,960
exposure notification system

1246
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,800
over time we've engaged with many

1247
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,640
organizations and provided ample

1248
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,920
opportunities for implementing

1249
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,480
jurisdictions to share their experiences

1250
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
learn from one another and hear from

1251
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,400
thought leaders both from within and

1252
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
outside the traditional public health

1253
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,160
community

1254
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,319
we've also connected states with

1255
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,920
asynchronous information sharing

1256
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
resources like the linux foundation

1257
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,119
public health

1258
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,599
slack workspace as well as webinars and

1259
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,440
other real-time forums for discussion

1260
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,040
the cornerstone of our approach was our

1261
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,280
exposure notification learning lab

1262
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,200
which served as the convening body and

1263
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,160
bi-weekly forum for consensus building

1264
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,480
we've held 13 meetings so far and each

1265
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,480
one tends to have between 35

1266
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,200
and 50 participants healing from between

1267
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,280
nine to 17 jurisdictions

1268
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,040
although on the whole we've had

1269
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,880
representation for all jurisdictions

1270
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,200
with live implementations

1271
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
we founded this community of practice on

1272
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,800
guiding principles that mitigate

1273
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,599
insular decision making first and

1274
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,240
foremost

1275
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,040
we default to a permissive dialogue this

1276
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,440
means

1277
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,200
including developers in public health

1278
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,800
discussions and including

1279
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,319
epidemiologists and technical

1280
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,839
discussions

1281
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,160
next become comfortable without being

1282
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,680
uncomfortable

1283
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,520
to a certain extent all of us are

1284
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
learning new things and maybe

1285
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,079
having fundamental perspectives it's

1286
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,760
incumbent on us to assume positive

1287
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,560
intent

1288
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,839
and seek common ground also

1289
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,240
embrace agility and iteration and know

1290
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,720
that there will be breaking changes

1291
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,480
this applies equally to the rapid

1292
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,000
iteration that the exposure

1293
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,400
notification api underwent early in the

1294
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,520
pandemic

1295
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,000
as well as pivots from public health

1296
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
with relation to best practices as we

1297
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,960
strive to implement the latest findings

1298
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,599
finally speak candidly and share results

1299
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,119
often

1300
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,800
regular presentations at the learning

1301
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,240
lab from jurisdictions

1302
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,240
on lessons learned has helped scale the

1303
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,880
effectiveness to all implementations

1304
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,880
linux foundation public health has

1305
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,280
served a particularly critical role here

1306
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,440
helping to distill best practices and

1307
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
posting faqs on their websites

1308
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,160
on topics as varied as legal language in

1309
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,680
the procurement process to risk

1310
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
configuration recommendations

1311
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,000
for state health apps

1312
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,680
in addition to the interdisciplinary

1313
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,359
support provided by the community of

1314
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,480
practice

1315
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,920
innovative thinking has flourished at

1316
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,800
the state level it's manifested as state

1317
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,040
government and technology collaboratives

1318
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,640
and collaborative public awareness

1319
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,040
campaigns and has served as a driver

1320
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
of successful implementations of the

1321
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,880
google and apple exposure notification

1322
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,160
system

1323
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,640
and the focus on privacy and equity has

1324
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,160
reinformed the most

1325
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,800
important relationship of all the one

1326
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,839
with the general public

1327
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,280
for instance a collaboration between the

1328
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,119
university of arizona

1329
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,079
and the we health nonprofit in the state

1330
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,440
health department resulted in a

1331
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,960
technical innovation

1332
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,480
that pushed the boundaries of what was

1333
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,079
possible in the google and apple

1334
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,480
exposure notification system

1335
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,720
these collaborators leveraged an early

1336
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,599
version

1337
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,599
of the api to inculcate the latest

1338
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,599
findings on transmission risk

1339
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,640
into the into their campus app and

1340
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,720
provide specific public health messaging

1341
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,839
based on more nuanced exposure levels

1342
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,839
colorado benefited from a state-led

1343
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,440
innovations program

1344
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,760
the colorado digital service modeled

1345
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,520
after the u.s digital service

1346
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,800
embedded software engineers designers

1347
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
product managers and procurement

1348
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,440
specialists into the health department

1349
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,839
this led to column colorado pioneering

1350
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,599
the use of an innovative method to

1351
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,440
automate a portion of the diagnosis

1352
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,160
verification

1353
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,680
process new jersey also had a state-led

1354
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,960
innovation program

1355
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,520
the new jersey office of innovation

1356
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,119
which assisted with the rollout of new

1357
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,079
jersey's app

1358
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,520
and contributed to the regional

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,480
released state branded apps

1362
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,760
based on the same open source code base

1363
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,000
finally washington state used creative

1364
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,119
marketing approaches

1365
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,720
like getting the lead singer of pearl

1366
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,160
jam to encourage

1367
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,920
washington residents to opt into

1368
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,079
exposure notification

1369
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
they also lived out there to their they

1370
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,280
also lived out

1371
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,280
their commitment to inclusion by

1372
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,280
translating the public health messaging

1373
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,280
in their app into 36 different languages

1374
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,720
although this broad community of

1375
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,960
practice has succeeded in innovative

1376
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,920
ways

1377
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,680
there is still more for us to do

1378
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,440
especially in the realm of evaluating

1379
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,640
the public health

1380
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,280
effectiveness of this technology in a

1381
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,359
truly agile and iterative way

1382
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,200
the community is continuing to balance

1383
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,800
the need for data collection and

1384
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,079
feedback loops

1385
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,760
with the need to maintain the trust of

1386
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,680
the public through private and secure

1387
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,480
implementations

1388
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,720
recent progress in this domain has

1389
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,560
provided more visibility into user

1390
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,680
metrics

1391
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,760
an opt-in-based approach for users to

1392
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
contribute more telemetry data

1393
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,359
is beginning to enable aggregate

1394
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,880
statistics to be gathered for

1395
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,280
implementing jurisdiction

1396
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,880
these data points are available to

1397
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,400
health authorities and implement

1398
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,560
implanting jurisdictions via an

1399
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
analytics portal created by apple and

1400
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,839
google and hosted by nih and mitre

1401
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,839
early adopters are gaining visibility

1402
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,079
into the number of active app users

1403
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,079
the number of positive diagnoses entered

1404
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,200
into the apps

1405
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,880
the number of exposure alerts they

1406
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,359
trigger the speed of notification of

1407
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,400
contacts

1408
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,319
and the number of contacts opening

1409
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,839
dismissing or ignoring their exposure

1410
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,000
alerts

1411
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,599
many of these metrics will assist the

1412
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,599
community in comparing the effectiveness

1413
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,280
of exposure notification

1414
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,680
to manual contact tracing and better

1415
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,079
articulate the relative contributions

1416
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,319
of each approach to the mitigation of

1417
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,760
transmission

1418
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,079
in response cdc has extended the

1419
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,839
learning lab approach for implementers

1420
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,400
using

1421
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,800
the analytics portal to facilitate these

1422
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,800
analyses

1423
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,280
in closing i hope that the nature and

1424
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,960
value of the relationships that have

1425
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,680
been formed

1426
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,119
within and between the public health

1427
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,040
community in the tech sector

1428
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,119
since the beginning of the pandemic is

1429
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,240
clear

1430
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,160
and i hope these experiences raise yet

1431
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,280
more questions

1432
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,520
on how to sustain the progress we've

1433
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,359
made and increase the effectiveness of

1434
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,839
this interdisciplinary dialogue

1435
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,520
for instance where do these

1436
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,200
relationships go when the pandemic

1437
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,400
concludes

1438
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,400
which ones remain and what makes them

1439
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,599
durable

1440
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,200
and how can we generalize what we've

1441
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,040
learned and apply those lessons to

1442
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,680
persistent

1443
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,760
issues like the modernization of public

1444
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,680
health i.t infrastructure

1445
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,680
and better integration of electronic lab

1446
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,280
and case reporting data

1447
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,400
across the local state and territorial

1448
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,839
and federal landscapes

1449
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,839
