1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,080
um so i'm going to talk today about

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,920
healthcare ecosystem security's role in

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
helping healthtech find its way

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,600
so this

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,520
back in 2016 i was starting to look for

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,199
a new job and i really wanted to go work

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,320
at a small company and i

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,599
wanted to find someone who would

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,359
actually hire a security person at a

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,160
really small company and around the same

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,960
time avi rubin gave a talk at enigma

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,880
about health i.t security and this was

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,760
really

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,559
a good moment for me because i

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,640
wanted to find a way to help people

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,120
while doing security and health tech

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,480
seemed like a great opportunity when i

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,600
talk about health tech i'm really

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,079
talking about uh technology enabled

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,760
health care products or services

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,039
typically things that are available

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,320
outside traditional medical

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,160
establishments it's a huge area of

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
investment now and for the past few

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,039
years

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,760
just calling out that in 2021 there was

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
over 20 billion investment in the first

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,960
nine months

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,760
and

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,280
the reasons are pretty obvious i think

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
most people are just really looking for

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,400
the same convenience and accessibility

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,720
they see in consumer services

34
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,240
and the pandemic has obviously driven

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,600
this even more

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,240
uh so i spent two years at a mobile

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,920
medication management app and then i

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
joined a digital pharmacy to run the

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,159
security program and in both cases i was

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,040
the first security hire and got to

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
build the team and build the security

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
program and i went through

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
a high trust certification in one of the

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,159
cases

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,240
so i'm going to start by talking what

46
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,759
healthcare looks like when you start

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,840
kind of understanding the relationships

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
when you go to a doctor's office

49
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
you might initially be

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,399
redirected to a scheduling service where

51
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,680
you interact with them in order to

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
actually schedule your appointment once

53
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
you show up at the doctor's office your

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,439
information is going to be recorded in

55
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,520
an electronic health record your doctor

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,920
might send a prescription to a pharmacy

57
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,759
for you and then after you leave the

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,439
doctor's going to use a claims processor

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,040
in order to build the health insurance

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
company for the care they just delivered

61
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,159
these relationships are very well

62
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,280
defined

63
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,959
and there are rules about how

64
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,318
information moves between these

65
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,480
organizations

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
in particular we

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,879
any information that is collected about

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,000
a person's health by or for a covered

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
entity

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,560
that's what we call protected health

71
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
information and

72
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,000
in this case the covered entities are

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
the

74
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,160
healthcare organizations have direct

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
relationships with the patient so that's

76
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,360
the health insurance plan

77
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
the doctor and the pharmacy

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,959
each of these

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,080
covered entities is going to have

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
different organizations that help them

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,040
deliver that care and these are their

82
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,680
business associates in this case

83
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
the claims processor is a business

84
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,200
associate the health insurance company

85
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,480
and the electronic health record and

86
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,000
scheduling service those are going to be

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
business associates of the doctor

88
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
and there are a bunch of rules usually

89
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,360
collectively referred to as hipaa even

90
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,040
if that isn't actually what they are

91
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
that pretty much describe how you should

92
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,480
do these things what how this

93
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,879
information should be collected how it

94
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,280
should be shared and how it should be

95
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,840
protected

96
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,760
this is really an ecosystem and every

97
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,080
ecosystem has a food chain

98
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,560
uh the covered entities are essentially

99
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,239
the carnivores

100
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,959
the providers like doctors and hospitals

101
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
and pharmacies as well

102
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,760
health plans are also covered entities

103
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,440
including insurance companies government

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
and employer-sponsored health plans

105
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,840
they also include

106
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,480
more they they make use of these

107
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
business associates which are

108
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,040
essentially the herbivores in this

109
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,080
ecosystem so it could be very specific

110
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
healthcare services

111
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,400
such as

112
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
e-prescribing or claims processing it

113
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,799
also just generic surface pretty much

114
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
every it service everything from your

115
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,760
aws hosting service to

116
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
um you know

117
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
your actual any cloud hosting you do any

118
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,239
email any of that is going to end up

119
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,519
being almost certainly a business

120
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,640
associate

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,200
the apex predators in this ecosystem

122
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,439
those are the big enterprise healthcare

123
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,840
organizations in this case the example i

124
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,080
gave before if that doctor was actually

125
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,560
part of a health provider network

126
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
they would have

127
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,199
rules that they were following based on

128
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
that health provider that dictated how

129
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,279
they handle information and how they do

130
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
security and they're going to pass those

131
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
rules down to the messaging service so

132
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
you can think of this as sort of being a

133
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,800
food chain

134
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,479
why are we talking about the ecosystem

135
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,880
it's because there are forces that are

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
acting on security in the healthcare

137
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,280
ecosystem that are a little bit

138
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
different and understanding those are

139
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,240
going to help you make decisions as a

140
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
security practitioner

141
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,360
i like to think of some of these forces

142
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
as being the weather regulatory is

143
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
really driving a lot of what happens in

144
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,919
healthcare security

145
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,040
there's hipaa and other laws which

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,639
those regulations are then interpreted

147
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,840
by different organizations such as

148
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,160
health and human services and then

149
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
that guidance that

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
hhs publishes is interpreted by various

151
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,440
companies and that becomes sort of the

152
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,960
industry standard so all these

153
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,600
regulatory forces can have interesting

154
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,880
impacts

155
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,520
the example i like to give is that hhs

156
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
has established that fax is considered a

157
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
secure transmission method

158
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,039
if the recipient's fax number can be

159
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,960
confirmed however because email

160
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,479
transmits data electronically the

161
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,919
guidance is less specific and many

162
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,440
healthcare entities ban its use for

163
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
transmitting phi the result is that the

164
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
healthcare ecosystem falls back to

165
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
faxing time and time again despite it

166
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,600
being incredibly unreliable transmission

167
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
mechanism and the actual market for

168
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
electronic faxes is incredibly unhealthy

169
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
uh one of my providers went to find a

170
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
second efax provider because it was so

171
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,560
our first was so unreliable and we

172
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
discovered that

173
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
half of the

174
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,080
supposedly hipaa compliant vendors are

175
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,240
owned by the same parent company and

176
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,600
most of them can't actually prove

177
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
anything resembling hipaa compliance

178
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
another force within the healthcare

179
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
ecosystem is third party risk it's kind

180
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,039
of the pollution it's a pollution of

181
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,880
every ecosystem it's certainly not

182
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
unique to healthcare but

183
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,440
because of the regulatory framework

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,720
every covered entity and business

185
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,479
associate is required to complete a risk

186
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
assessment have a business associate

187
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
agreement specifying how data can be

188
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,560
used how it must be protected

189
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,360
and

190
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,639
all of these business associate

191
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,160
agreements require subcontractors to be

192
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
bound by the same restrictor

193
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,639
requirements

194
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,479
this can have really different impacts

195
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,160
than you might see in other networks i

196
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,880
mentioned one breach where because

197
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,319
these vendors tend to consolidate with

198
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,800
the healthcare network there was a

199
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
capturerx breach that impacted over a

200
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,960
million patients because so many

201
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,880
hospitals use the exact same vendor and

202
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,199
it was a really appealing target for

203
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,639
an attacker

204
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,560
another impact you see is that the same

205
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
breach might feel really different in

206
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,720
the healthcare environment

207
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
many people might be familiar with last

208
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
year a surveillance camera manufacturer

209
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,400
called verkata had a breach so their

210
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
cloud storage was actually breached and

211
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
this impacted a lot of companies i think

212
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
some of us saw the video cam footage of

213
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,319
octa's hallways

214
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,840
it was really different for a

215
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,759
psychiatric hospital that was also

216
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,840
impacted by that breach

217
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
the impact that we see in the overall

218
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,199
healthcare ecosystem is that this limits

219
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
the pools of vendors to either more

220
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,319
mature vendors that are actually

221
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,080
equipped to handle this risk

222
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
or

223
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,240
i may be more mature and legacy

224
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,759
or those that are unable to live up to

225
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
the requirement but are willing to sign

226
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,680
a business associate agreement anyway

227
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
so it could be really challenging to

228
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
actually bring on vendors and in

229
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
particular

230
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,479
a lot of infrastructure and data vendors

231
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,720
that are common in other small companies

232
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
aren't available to those who have

233
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,960
healthcare data

234
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,720
another force we see in healthcare is

235
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,120
adaptation

236
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,560
one thing i've seen a lot of is consumer

237
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,080
health and wellness

238
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,440
companies actually have different

239
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,080
requirements they are not bound by hipaa

240
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
they do have other privacy requirements

241
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
but they don't have to handle phi so

242
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,919
they can avoid some of these impacts

243
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,960
they maybe don't have the same

244
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,879
requirements around third-party risk so

245
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
a lot of companies will initially offer

246
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
consumer health services and then

247
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
actually face an uphill battle when they

248
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,720
try to achieve hipaa compliance at a

249
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,319
later point in time having made

250
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,440
different choices early on

251
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,840
uh last force i wanted to mention is the

252
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,919
invasive species of the ecosystem which

253
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
is certifications

254
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,319
um invasive species are often introduced

255
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
for perfectly good reasons uh the

256
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,759
example i like to give here is i live in

257
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,280
san francisco and when there's a bunch

258
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
of overgrowth

259
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,360
they'll drop off some goats and leave

260
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,800
them there for a couple days to clear it

261
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,958
all out and this is great you end up

262
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,000
with a very uh empty area that doesn't

263
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
have any of this overgrowth but if they

264
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,679
stayed for a long time they would start

265
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,159
actually eating the trees so when you

266
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,679
introduce an invasive species often it's

267
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,360
done for a good reason but it can have

268
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
unexpected impacts and in this case

269
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,600
the certifications are attempt to

270
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
standardize third-party risk and

271
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
assessments and simplify under

272
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
management but they push outdated

273
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,360
security controls and may fail to reduce

274
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
risk in modern environments and crowd

275
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,640
out more effective controls and

276
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,560
impactful business associates so an

277
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,600
organization that gets that

278
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
certification is going to be more

279
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,680
successful even if they maybe got it not

280
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,040
by being more secure

281
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
so now we've talked a little about the

282
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
overall ecosystem

283
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,160
i want to talk about why i think there's

284
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,279
actually a great opportunity for

285
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,880
healthtech to succeed in this and how

286
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,320
security can actually be part of that

287
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,959
success

288
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,720
one strategy that healthtech has been

289
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
pursuing is

290
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
finding a small niche

291
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
healthtech can often scale up in

292
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
specific areas by eliminating in-person

293
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,320
care physical proximity and more complex

294
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
case care cases um

295
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
a couple examples that i can think of

296
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
often i had are mental health

297
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,680
telehealth therapy has been huge

298
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,240
especially in the past couple years um

299
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,920
and it's also been really important for

300
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
things like birth control which used to

301
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,519
require going in person for what is a

302
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
fairly routine prescription you can now

303
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
do a telehealth visit and have it

304
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
delivered to your door a very seamless

305
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,199
process

306
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,800
security has the opportunity here to

307
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,399
avoid legacy risk this is what i thought

308
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,600
when i was getting into healthtech i

309
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
would get to do which is just kind of

310
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,000
start over from modern building blocks

311
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
and avoid the legacy hardware and

312
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,480
software reduce the reliance on physical

313
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,120
access and networks and a more

314
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,800
centralized model because a lot of

315
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,320
healthcare entities are small providers

316
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,760
offices and they don't have the

317
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,600
technical resources to implement the

318
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,720
right security controls so by

319
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,560
centralizing it you have the opportunity

320
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,119
to do so

321
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,160
another survival strategy that we see in

322
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,079
a lot of health tech companies is

323
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,839
convenience

324
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,800
patients find receiving care challenging

325
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,920
because they cannot get to the right

326
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
location they can't be there at the

327
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,680
right time health tech startups that

328
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,600
focus on telehealth delivery and making

329
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
accessing care more convenient attract

330
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
patients and actually are really

331
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
appealing to the payers the insurance

332
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
companies and even the employers

333
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
sometimes because they encourage

334
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
preventive care

335
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,880
some great examples of this are digital

336
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,519
pharmacies uh and remote physical

337
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,720
therapy is one that i came across

338
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,079
recently which i thought was brilliant

339
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,600
because i personally have been a

340
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,040
position where i just didn't get

341
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
physical therapy for an injury because i

342
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
could not make an appointment during

343
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
business hours

344
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,000
um security opportunity here to me is

345
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
giving patients control

346
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,200
because these um

347
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
these startups are based on the idea of

348
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
convenience there's the opportunity to

349
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
avoid some of healthcare organizations

350
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,880
often paternalistic ideas of how to

351
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
secure patient data if it was intended

352
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,040
to make to allow patients to actually

353
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
move their data around so we should

354
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,640
actually support that

355
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,079
but we need to educate patients and

356
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,519
allow them to understand the choices

357
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,240
that they're making about authentication

358
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,640
communication choices authorization

359
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
i actually did a project at one of my

360
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,120
employers where we reworked the

361
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,200
way in which patients opted into

362
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
authorizing putting protected health

363
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
information in text messages

364
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
i personally don't want any of my phi

365
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
and text messages but

366
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,920
by working with our product and design

367
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,519
team to build a workflow that was really

368
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,880
clear and people knew exactly what

369
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,800
they're doing that was work i was very

370
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,639
proud of i was especially proud when i

371
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,959
went to a large healthcare organization

372
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,519
and was checking out after to pay for a

373
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,560
visit

374
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,399
and accidentally opted into

375
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
uh phi and text messages because they

376
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
put their workflow in the middle of the

377
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,839
payment flow

378
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,839
and i was just clicking through it and i

379
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,120
authorized it without even realizing

380
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,560
what i was doing so this is a place

381
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,839
where security can actually make a

382
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,360
difference in terms of educating

383
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
patients

384
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,320
the last survival strategy i'd like to

385
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
talk about is skipping hipaa as i

386
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,160
mentioned consumer wellness startups are

387
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,680
not acting as a healthcare provider or

388
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
business associate and they may not be

389
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
subject to hipaa for a while but they

390
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,959
still have to abide by other privacy

391
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,480
laws and can often be that often could

392
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,399
be less vernism especially for an

393
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,639
organization that's not ready to manage

394
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,959
third party risk the way hipaa requires

395
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,800
examples of this are fitness trackers

396
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
and medication management

397
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,519
approaches

398
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,440
and the opportunity here as a security

399
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,920
person is to actually really

400
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,760
do the risk identification up front

401
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
you're going to have to be doing some

402
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,890
risk identification for the

403
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,000
[Music]

404
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,120
privacy rules that are in play ccpa gdpr

405
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,720
or others

406
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,639
so you can also start to think forward

407
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,839
because this or if you're at an

408
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,120
organization that's going to be thinking

409
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
about hipaa you have the opportunity to

410
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,200
see that coming track the vendors see

411
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,279
which ones are hipaa compliant track

412
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,959
which data is identifiable because that

413
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,320
becomes really important as you move

414
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,320
into handling uh phi and finally require

415
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
an audible record of all access to user

416
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
data by services employees and partners

417
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,600
this seems like something every

418
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
organization should do unfortunately

419
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,120
it's not and it's the one that hurts the

420
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,200
most when you start really getting into

421
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,720
um handling some of the requirements

422
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,279
around hipaa

423
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
so

424
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,399
i

425
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,839
i did this for five years and then

426
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,920
just about a month before this talk i

427
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,600
quit my job

428
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,279
so i think one thing i wanted to talk a

429
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,959
little bit about is

430
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,000
whether

431
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,440
i still feel the same way about

432
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,320
security's ability to impact health tech

433
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,000
and the answer is yes i think there's

434
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
still a lot of opportunity for security

435
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,880
to come into a healthtech organization

436
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,320
and make a difference in how they handle

437
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
data i think it's really important to go

438
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,760
in and actually understand why that

439
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,040
organization

440
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,120
is asking you to come i think it's

441
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,160
really important to understand their

442
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,560
motivations there was a talk earlier

443
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,839
today where they mentioned that

444
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,720
sometimes a cso is hired

445
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,360
purely for regulatory or reputational

446
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,480
reasons

447
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
that does happen in health tech and

448
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,360
that's definitely something anyone

449
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,560
that's going into this area should be

450
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,959
thinking about and considering if that's

451
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,240
what's going on

452
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,040
but at the same time every single one of

453
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,720
these organizations that i've worked at

454
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,079
or talked to

455
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,600
everyone actually does want to do the

456
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,959
right thing

457
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,160
one things i've been really impressed

458
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
with is when i talk to an engineer at

459
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,079
one of these companies

460
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,120
part of the reason they're there is

461
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,560
because they believe in the mission and

462
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,480
they want to do the right thing so the

463
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
answer is yes this is a really important

464
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,720
work and i think more people should be

465
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,880
actively trying to be in in the area but

466
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,920
also

467
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,079
you should go into it understanding what

468
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,519
the motivations are

469
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,360
and you should go into understanding

470
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,680
that we are still in health care um i

471
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,199
mentioned avi ruben's talk at the

472
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,360
beginning of this because

473
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,120
it was i went back and watched it

474
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
actually the other day and it was very

475
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,279
um

476
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,480
i probably should have watched it more

477
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,160
often um

478
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,920
there are some fundamental truths i've

479
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
learned about healthcare security in the

480
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,079
past five years even in healthtech first

481
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,480
and foremost confidentiality is not the

482
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
top of the confidentiality integrity and

483
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,839
availability training

484
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,680
triangle for healthcare at the end of

485
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
the day the most important thing is

486
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,680
delivering care to patients and that is

487
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,759
where the priority will be so integrity

488
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,000
and availability are incredibly

489
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
important and often more important than

490
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,199
confidentiality

491
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,240
second thing i learned is that

492
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,079
regulators drive healthcare security not

493
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,320
technology there might be a better

494
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,480
technology available that would reduce

495
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,440
risk

496
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,120
but if it does not fit with the way

497
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,040
regulators think about security you

498
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,639
might not be able to do it and so you

499
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,320
have to be very realistic about that and

500
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
you have to understand what the rules

501
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,759
are because if you do not understand the

502
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,440
rules it doesn't matter if you're

503
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,519
reducing risk that's not going to help

504
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,839
the organization you're working at

505
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,800
succeed um

506
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
third-party risk is a lot of the job um

507
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,360
i think that's one thing is that uh

508
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
if you're not willing to engage with

509
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
third party risk you probably can find

510
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,759
someplace else to work because i cannot

511
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,839
think of any place in health tech that

512
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,839
doesn't involve third party

513
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,480
and finally facts will never die like it

514
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,199
just

515
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,800
there is nothing that will kill it i

516
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,959
came in thinking i'm going to not have

517
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,240
to work with it we're going to find a

518
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
way to avoid it and it's there it's

519
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
always going to be there we cannot avoid

520
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,639
it

521
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,560
and on that note

522
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,800
i'm done
