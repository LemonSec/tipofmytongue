service provision ways as well as in

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
anti-trafficking spaces that serve folks

72
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,040
that are trafficked uh regardless of

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,080
industry predominantly in

on sex work with an emphasis on online

87

with new york university press it's the

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
first comprehensive research monograph

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,799
on the erotic webcam industry my recent

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,200
academic journals articles focus on the

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
labor experiences of transgender and

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
disabled sex workers

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
my work specifically on trans masculine

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,159
and non-binary escorts focuses

99
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,080
on how marginal identities and social

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
locations shape online harm reduction

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,040
strategies and how sexism shapes

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
workplaces and leave our experiences

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,159
more broadly

104
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,760
my newest article on sex work and

105
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
disability is forthcoming in a special

106
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,920
issue of disability studies quarterly

107
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
and shows that erotic labor is far more

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,239
accessible than most square or vanilla

109
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,480
work and according to my respondents

110
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
especially trans people sex work is

111
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,239
often the only work available to them

112
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
that accommodates their needs and lives

113
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
uh finally i have a forthcoming piece on

114
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,120
pasta sesta and it's transnational harms

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
to sex workers which i sense will come

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,760
up in our conversations today and i know

117
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,519
all of us on this battle have much to

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,519
say about its harmful effects and i

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,199
think it's critical that so many harmful

120
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,199
policies like foster regulating the

121
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,120
internet have disastrous effects on

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,520
privacy and free speech and are not

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,600
limited to sex workers and should sound

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,520
the alarm to anyone interested in

125
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
protecting individual rights but let me

126
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
stop there because once i get older

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
wonderful thank you

128
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
um yeah so our first question for our

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
panelists today

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
is what is one thing about sex work that

131
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
you wish a technical audience understood

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,759
and i'll let whoever feels uh most

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,600
excited about answering that first go

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,880
ahead

135
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,280
um i can hop in um

136
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
i think one of the things that's really

137
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
really important and uh is really shaped

138
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,160
by the dialogue that we have is that

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,960
there is not a dichotomy between

140
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
trafficking victims and people that

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,880
trade sex when we're talking about folks

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
at trade sex we are talking about every

143
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,680
single identity class race documentation

144
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
status ability uh physical ability

145
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,000
status mental uh

146
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,080
disability status and that's true we're

147
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
also talking about people who face a

148
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,280
range of experiences of of what trading

149
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
sex looks like and so when we're talking

150
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,199
about people that treat sex that

151
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,120
includes people who have a lot of

152
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
options and have a lot of other choices

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,639
available that includes people that have

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,400
a constrained number of choices and for

155
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,120
whom sex work really is the best way to

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,479
meet their needs

157
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,320
to meet their resource needs based on

158
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,240
the other circumstances of their lives

159
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,440
you're talking about people who are

160
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
vulnerable to trafficking and are very

161
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
much facing different forms of

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
exploitation you're talking about people

163
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
currently in trafficking situations who

164
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,759
are looking for opportunities to fight

165
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,440
support to leave and you're talking

166
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,800
about people who have

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,039
recently and long left their trafficking

168
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,280
situation so when we say that something

169
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,319
impacts folks that treat sex and

170
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,479
decision impacts sex workers we are

171
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,319
talking about every single one of those

172
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,960
categories and when we talk about how

173
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
people are impacted the people with less

174
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,880
opportunity are the people who are most

175
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,199
impacted so let's say there's something

176
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
that happens that kicks sex workers off

177
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,560
a platform or they lose a platform

178
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,400
people with a lot of other opportunities

179
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
people with a lot of other choices

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,880
available

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
probably are going to be okay

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,840
they're going to be able to go somewhere

183
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,720
else they're going to be able to do

184
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
something else people who have less

185
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
options including people whose

186
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,960
trafficker does not care about the loss

187
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
of that platform about losing that

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
account about losing that income

189
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,720
does not care

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,319
and so when we're talking about

191
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,800
impacting folks that trade sex that

192
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,240
includes everyone who is in proximity to

193
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,639
or experiencing a trafficking situation

194
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,479
and the binary that was created is

195
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,800
entirely an imposed one and not a

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,280
natural one

197
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
mic drop

198
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,599
thank you

199
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,680
that concludes our panel we're done

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
um

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,919
angela do you want to go next

202
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
no i mean i think you can jump in i was

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,440
thinking the same thing like mike

204
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
dropped i mean kate nailed it i mean i

205
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
think if i'm going to add anything very

206
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,319
briefly it's just to say that i wish

207
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,240
that folks on the tech side

208
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,960
understood that these kind of

209
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,840
the choices that folks are making around

210
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,520
algorithms the design of websites i'm

211
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
changing constantly changing terms of

212
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
service all very often have incredibly

213
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,360
delterious effects on sex workers um but

214
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,759
but kendra yeah please feel free to jump

215
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,000
in yeah i think there i really struggled

216
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,280
actually how to answer this question

217
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
because in some ways the entire panel is

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,240
an answer to this question right like

219
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,599
what you know that like that's what

220
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,360
we're trying to do but i think that one

221
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,960
of the things that i've learned in

222
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,639
particular as someone who works in

223
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,240
coalition with lots of sex workers but

224
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,919
doesn't have a background in sex work

225
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,879
and hasn't done sex work is that the

226
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
idea that sex workers were not already

227
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,400
present in the spaces you were in is

228
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,879
false right you know just because you

229
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,440
don't know that folks have traded sex

230
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,080
that folks have um engaged in forms of

231
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
sex work you know or the folks

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
experience trafficking like doesn't mean

233
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
those folks aren't already present in

234
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,960
the spaces that you're in both at this

235
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
conference but also sort of more broadly

236
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,879
in technical spaces you know the number

237
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,960
of folks who i think have done some sort

238
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,599
of sex work and then ended up not ended

239
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,599
up in tech because often doing sex work

240
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,840
is some of the same kinds of skills that

241
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
it is required for things like computer

242
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
security or like tech more broadly is

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
really large and so i think that when we

244
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,919
think about you know just as kate sort

245
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,839
of was like troubling the binary rate of

246
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,679
like you know sex trafficking versus sex

247
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,680
work rate it's also important to

248
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,120
remember that like

249
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,000
you know

250
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
it is not as if the sex workers or folks

251
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
who trade sex are over there and we are

252
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,519
over here these are always going to be

253
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
overlapping categories and you know some

254
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,680
of the you know what i see

255
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,279
my work is doing is sort of creating

256
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,800
space for folks who are already in these

257
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
spaces to talk about either their

258
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
experiences if they want to or just to

259
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,560
share kind of the things that they know

260
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
whether they want to identify with a

261
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,519
particular label or not

262
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,000
amazing thank you all

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
um

264
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
next up i'd like to ask what the main

265
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
threats are

266
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,839
to the sex workers with whom you work or

267
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,240
from you know your point of view working

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
with these uh communities and uh kate

269
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,680
i'll ask that you kick us off uh here

270
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,480
again since your your answers have been

271
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
so good so far

272
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,200
um

273
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,959
yeah i think and and we're gonna talk

274
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
about a lot of different that's i think

275
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,600
for me um as an organizer and as someone

276
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,240
who works uh directly with folks the

277
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
concerns i have are not about any kind

278
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,160
of individual platform but about the

279
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,399
risk people take when they are kicked

280
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,760
off of certain platforms or where they

281
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,800
do lose access to certain spaces and so

282
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,320
you know when

283
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,399
there's kind of right now this idea that

284
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,080
like lack of visibility means that

285
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,519
people go away

286
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,440
and sex workers don't go away you know

287
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,959
losing a platform doesn't come with like

288
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,800
a living wage job that provides child

289
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,560
care and so

290
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
what happens is people make other

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,240
decisions and they move around often to

292
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
places and spaces that they had

293
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,839
previously looked at and said that

294
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,040
doesn't work for me i'm going to choose

295
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,399
something better

296
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,320
and so what we're talking about is yes

297
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,480
some people do get

298
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,120
get kicked off a platform or lose access

299
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
and sometimes they do go into street

300
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
based work sometimes they do go into

301
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,519
more

302
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,320
in-person ways but that is really

303
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,360
dependent on a lot of different

304
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,519
circumstances what people mostly end up

305
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
doing is going to other websites and

306
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,440
going to other platforms and especially

307
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
as more and more of these spaces pop up

308
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,640
it is it does become somewhat predatory

309
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,079
sometimes where people are constantly

310
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
getting emails about like have you tried

311
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,079
this website have you tried this website

312
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,839
and every time these crackdowns on

313
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,519
websites happen or every time these

314
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
crackdowns from websites happen what

315
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
happens is people move to

316
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,600
places where it's predominantly based

317
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,079
offshore it is you don't have customer

318
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,920
service anymore you can't call anyone

319
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,160
there's less opportunities if someone uh

320
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,959
if you post an ad and something happens

321
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,880
to that ad someone steals your picture

322
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,640
someone steals your information there's

323
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,120
nowhere to go and so you have more and

324
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,519
more where people are giving ids credit

325
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
card information uh

326
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,480
pictures that they don't want

327
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,120
distributed uh without their consent to

328
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
as many different places you go because

329
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,399
you're still looking to make up that

330
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,519
income

331
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
and you're dealing with people who are

332
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,640
more conscious about taking on that risk

333
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
of criminalization that liability to

334
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
host this information and that means

335
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,880
that it's really restraining the choices

336
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
and you're forced to make choices that

337
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,800
compromise certain parts of safety

338
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
you're giving up the safety that you had

339
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,959
on a website that was based in the

340
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,120
united states like rentboy where you had

341
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,720
a customer service department you have

342
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,680
to give up the safety that it offered to

343
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
be able to still make your resource

344
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,600
needs and so your needs don't change

345
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,360
what happens is your risk calculation

346
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,680
does

347
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,000
thank you absolutely um angela i'll ask

348
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,399
if you want to to share next

349
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,000
oh yeah oh yeah i want to

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
um

351
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,040
so i mean as far as my research and

352
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,880
thinking about the primary threats that

353
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
sex workers face you know my research on

354
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,959
the caming industry folks talked a lot

355
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
about things like discriminatory content

356
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,360
moderation but if the question is really

357
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,959
about the prime wavering or one of the

358
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,720
primary issues i'm going to focus much

359
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
of my comments

360
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,079
on online banking

361
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,079
um discrimination

362
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,040
um as this ongoing threat to sex workers

363
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,880
and specifically the systemic banking

364
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,600
discrimination they face and the ways

365
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,160
that it cuts across industry sectors um

366
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,519
so let me actually just start really

367
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
quick with two flash points so first i'm

368
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,399
sure some folks in the audience remember

369
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,360
in december 2020 when the major credit

370
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
card companies namely visa and

371
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,519
mastercard stopped processing payments

372
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,000
for the tube site pornhub the second

373
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
moment also during the pandemic timing

374
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,760
not a coincidence mind you was when

375
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
mastercard threatened to stop processing

376
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,519
payments for pornographic content on

377
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,920
only fans which they then walked back

378
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,000
due to sex worker activism and frankly

379
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,839
some of the most positive news coverage

380
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,600
of sex workers i've ever seen in the

381
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
mainstream which frankly undoubtedly was

382
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
related to misguided public perceptions

383
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,680
of who works on only fans so picture

384
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
young white middle-class content

385
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,399
creators struggling to survive during

386
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,160
the pandemic

387
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,959
what happened with pornhub and only fans

388
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,760
is actually a microcosm of two much

389
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,680
bigger issues one

390
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,079
systemic banking discrimination and the

391
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,880
and two the growing political capital of

392
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,279
right-wing religious anti-porn and

393
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,680
anti-sex work groups who manipulate

394
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,920
public outcries over labor trafficking

395
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
to further their endgame of ending all

396
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,120
sexual commerce so well before the

397
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
pornhub and only fans moments sex

398
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,279
workers have been dealing with the

399
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,720
effects of systemic banking and

400
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
financial discrimination while sex

401
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,639
workers can sometimes fly under their

402
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,680
radar american express cash app chase

403
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,959
bank paypal venmo already had policies

404
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,880
refusing to process payments for sex

405
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360
workers across erotic industries

406
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,079
including legal ones like porn and so i

407
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,839
think it's important that we recognize

408
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,160
the impact here right like beyond the

409
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,240
adverse effects on wages

410
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,399
as if that wasn't enough i'd ask

411
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,000
everyone here in the audience to think

412
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
about this for a minute can you imagine

413
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,120
being a self-employed entrepreneur in a

414
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
capitalist economy and having your

415
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,240
access to an entire banking system cut

416
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,120
off

417
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,199
right this has implications for housing

418
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,720
access credit insurance and so on and

419
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,639
this form of occupational and banking

420
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,279
discriminations to my mind are civil

421
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,760
rights issues right and so make no

422
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,079
mistake this financial discrimination is

423
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,959
by design not by accident this is all

424
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,120
part of the strategy of anti-porn and

425
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,360
anti-sex work groups like the national

426
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,519
center on the sexual exploitation

427
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,600
formerly morality in the media groups

428
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,639
like exodus cry to defund and as kate

429
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,959
was so eloquently talking about deep

430
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,279
platform sex workers right so these

431
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
groups exploit anti-trafficking efforts

432
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,639
to further their goal again this endgame

433
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,360
of ending all sexual commerce so sex

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,959
workers must fight this kind of

435
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,680
multi-front war involving right-wing

436
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
religious anti-porn groups and activists

437
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,600
the carsonal state and harmful

438
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,160
governmental policies and discriminatory

439
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,240
financial and banking institutions

440
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
thanks angela and next up kendra i'm

441
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,440
hoping that you can kind of

442
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,360
you know take us further into the the

443
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
policy side and what you've seen there

444
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,000
in terms of threats um again i get the

445
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,759
the privilege of attempting to go after

446
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,160
angela who again just dropped the mic um

447
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,320
so i i guess i will sort of angela did a

448
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,600
really good job of talking about sort of

449
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
the financial discrimination and i want

450
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,759
to kind of bring us to talking about

451
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,600
fosta which some of you may be familiar

452
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
with but i'll just sort of back up a

453
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,959
little bit because i think

454
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,720
what angela was talking about about sort

455
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,920
of the right wing moral panic anti-sex

456
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
work anti-sex stuff also shows up in

457
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,199
kind of the lead up to foster so foster

458
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,120
is the fight online sex trafficking act

459
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,440
of 2018. it was combined with a bill

460
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
called sesta it i honestly think that

461
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,560
like picking and it's sort of arbitrary

462
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
which one you call it right is it faster

463
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
is it sesto well it really was the worst

464
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
of both so like whatever you want right

465
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
um but basically

466
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
uh

467
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,160
foster sesta did a couple different

468
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,519
things and one of those things has

469
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,040
gotten a lot of attention and that's the

470
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,720
changes to section 230 you heard us

471
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,160
talking about section 230 yesterday we

472
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
will talk about section 238 tomorrow if

473
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,920
you had a bingo card section 2 for this

474
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
conference section 230 would be on it we

475
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,199
could play a drinking game but the point

476
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,560
being that foster sesta

477
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,120
eliminated immunity in a very small

478
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
number of cases for conduct involving

479
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
sex trafficking

480
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
and

481
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,199
also some conduct involving promotion or

482
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,520
facilitation of prostitution

483
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,760
now

484
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,079
it's hard to talk about foster sesta

485
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
because there's what the law says which

486
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,919
i have written along with my colleague

487
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
laura lee and elizabeth brundage god

488
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,679
forsaken 87 pages on in our law review

489
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,079
article fausta in legal context but

490
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,679
there's what it did and frankly those

491
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
two things have very little to do with

492
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,559
each other

493
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,039
so what fosta says is it's a narrow set

494
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,360
of section 230 carved outs and a broad

495
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,600
federal new federal criminal provision

496
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,320
um that potentially covers uh online

497
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,880
platforms that facilitate or promote

498
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,640
both sex trafficking but also

499
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
prostitution aka sex work

500
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,480
um that's what fosters says the industry

501
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,600
reaction to foster and the policy steps

502
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
that were taken just

503
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,520
for what i presume is sort of at least

504
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,240
in part compliance reasons was vastly

505
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
disproportionate to the changes in 230

506
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
that actually occurred as a result of

507
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,120
this law

508
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
and i think that this what i like the

509
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
story i want to tell here is not just

510
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,080
that that i think represents how uh tech

511
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,520
platforms to some extent have been

512
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
complicit in the the uh sort of dynamics

513
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,559
angela is talking about which is sort of

514
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,240
over correcting by kicking off sex

515
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,080
workers even in cases where actual

516
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,919
liability would be minimal if at all um

517
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,600
because sex workers were not are not

518
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
considered a you know important

519
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
stakeholder group for some organization

520
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,760
organizations in the tech space i think

521
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,679
the other backstory bit about foster

522
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,039
that i want to tell that i feel like is

523
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,799
really important and i think maybe i

524
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,120
hope will resonate with this audience is

525
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,600
that um in the lead up to foster's

526
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,160
passage uh basically there was this back

527
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,919
and forth over these two different bills

528
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
one of which changed section 230 and the

529
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,679
other of which created a new federal

530
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,240
criminal provision um for online

531
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
platforms engaged in promotion or

532
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
facilitation of both trafficking and sex

533
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
work and i emphasize that not to

534
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,400
reiterate the binary that kate already

535
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,640
destroyed but because

536
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
i hear a lot that people are like oh

537
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
foster's a sex trafficking law that went

538
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,880
wrong and harm sex workers no it was

539
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,559
written to harm sex workers it's right

540
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,320
there in the text and you can see it and

541
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,679
you can see it in the messaging of

542
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,400
organizations like uh

543
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,559
morality and media now called national

544
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,480
center on sexual exploitation

545
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
but what happened during foster's

546
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,960
passage was that tech companies got

547
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
behind the federal criminal provisions

548
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,600
because they saw them as less risky to

549
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,960
their to their business models um than

550
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
the potential changes to section 230.

551
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
what passed was both of those things so

552
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,679
you know so much for that theory um but

553
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,840
what that effectively meant is that i

554
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,280
you know in the way i think about it

555
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,120
many companies were making sort of a

556
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,039
devil's bargain to say hey you know the

557
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,400
people who are going to be charged under

558
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,840
these federal criminal provisions are

559
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,559
not going to be google or meta or

560
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,679
you know

561
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
amazon pick your pick your large tech

562
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,280
company here you know this is going to

563
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,039
be smaller sites that specifically cater

564
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,120
to sex workers or specifically are you

565
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,720
know uh

566
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,440
not don't have the resources and that

567
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,240
sort of dynamic where um

568
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
large entities are sort of pushing

569
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,280
criminal risk on smaller organizations

570
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,799
and on people

571
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,840
because they view that as preferential

572
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,600
from sort of a bottom line perspective

573
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,280
is like one of basically what we're

574
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,960
seeing also in the financial space to

575
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,360
some extent right this form of violence

576
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,720
um that comes from a sort of

577
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,159
misunderstanding of kind of what

578
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
criminalization means

579
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,200
i've already gone along so i'll just

580
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,360
like do a beat more on that which is to

581
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,039
say that you know i know there's lots of

582
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,200
folks in this room and watching online

583
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,720
who are familiar with the computer fraud

584
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
and abuse act right so the federal

585
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,480
anti-hacking statute and i think the

586
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,000
folks in this room would probably say

587
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,200
that there's things that might be

588
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
prohibited under the federal the under

589
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,039
the computer front abuse act things that

590
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,200
would be federal crimes um that they

591
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
don't actually find harmful and they

592
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,240
don't really think should be illegal

593
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,039
right

594
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,440
and i you know in some ways i like want

595
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,200
people to take that same framework where

596
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,720
they understand that behaviors that they

597
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,440
do every day could be criminalized

598
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
and that you know that causes immense

599
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,600
harm to them and causes immense risk and

600
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,320
uh risk um and apply it to sex work

601
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,240
where you know we've seen

602
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,320
platforms sort of take on this like you

603
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,240
know make it go over there you know make

604
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
it go you know platform uh online

605
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,360
websites that uh serve ads moving

606
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,320
offshore because you know this is sort

607
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,919
of pushing criminalization risk on

608
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,679
somebody else and we've seen you know

609
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
tech companies and other folks in the

610
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,919
space in various areas take on really

611
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,760
significant legal risk in some cases

612
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
because it was worth it right i think

613
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
about things like google

614
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
um potential standing up to the federal

615
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,159
government and saying no you need a

616
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,400
warrant for the for emails right even if

617
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
they're older than 180 days

618
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,000
and i think what we haven't seen is that

619
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
kind of solidarity in reference to folks

620
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
who are doing sex work or folks who are

621
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,000
in the sex trades and that really makes

622
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
me sad because these are many of the

623
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
folks in this in that do work in this

624
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,720
space

625
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,880
are some of them are experiencing

626
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,200
profound criminalization and harm at the

627
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
hands of the kinds of d platforming that

628
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,719
were that angela was talking about

629
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,679
thanks kenja um i'll just add on a

630
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,440
little bit to kind of wrap that up right

631
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
which is coming from the you know the

632
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,480
european perspective right all of these

633
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,799
regulations this de-platforming the

634
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,080
discrimination

635
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,799
affects workers including those who are

636
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
you know legally registered to work

637
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,280
they're doing work they pay taxes on et

638
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,320
cetera

639
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,960
and so we often hear you know great pain

640
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
and confusion as well as significant

641
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840
harm right from not having access to

642
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,159
digital banking that means taking

643
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,720
cash payments or you know going to some

644
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,520
of these questionable uh websites that

645
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,600
kate was mentioning this means not being

646
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,960
able to discuss um harm reduction ways

647
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,039
of staying safe

648
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
not being able to be visible as a labor

649
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,840
force as a group

650
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
in the digital sphere right some terms

651
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,799
of service say on instagram don't allow

652
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,960
any conversation about commercial sex

653
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,200
work whether it's legal or not

654
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,360
and so that means a whole very large

655
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,720
group of people

656
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,799
estimated to be like 1 in 200 in the

657
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,159
world is completely becoming invisible

658
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,600
and that creates a lot of pain

659
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,919
especially when kind of us you know

660
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,880
regulation or sentiments or morality is

661
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
driving what happens for the rest of the

662
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,400
world

663
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,799
so i want to um ask a question to our

664
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,360
panelists that came up in the the slack

665
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,440
conversation um so one of our attendees

666
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,120
said you know they would love to see

667
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,640
some data on how many vc firms have you

668
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,120
know morality clauses or et cetera that

669
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,039
apply to what they will or won't invest

670
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,960
in and you know thoughts on how that

671
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
might affect startups you know in like

672
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
the fintech space or i'm going to say

673
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,400
just more broadly

674
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,480
um in the space of sort of digital

675
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,400
intimacy you know

676
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
how might that kind of funding

677
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,200
stipulations these kind of regulations

678
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,679
affect whether or not people will kind

679
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,240
of dare to have sex workers as customers

680
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,760
or users

681
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,080
or even support say sex worker-led

682
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,600
developments

683
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,320
um angela or kendra i'll let perhaps one

684
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,640
of you guys start off

685
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
i have a lot of thoughts but angela

686
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,480
you're welcome to go if you if you want

687
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,039
to want to start off no kendra please

688
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,480
take all right so

689
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,000
hey i think it's a great question and i

690
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,679
have no idea what the answer is right i

691
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,360
would be super curious to hear more

692
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,840
about sort of how like vc funding and

693
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,000
both you know explicit rules right

694
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,360
something like a morality clause but

695
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,679
also implicit sort of biases around what

696
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,080
stuff is worth funding um sort of is

697
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,799
shaping the space um my other two

698
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,520
thoughts there are you know in some ways

699
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
i'm a little skeptical of like trying to

700
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,679
like push for vc funding of platforms

701
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,200
that are gonna be like sex worker

702
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,039
centered or helpful for sex workers

703
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,559
because one dynamic we've seen in the

704
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,480
space over and over again like going

705
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,640
back basically as far as you

706
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,520
as far as the internet um and there's uh

707
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,960
our colleagues at hacking hustling

708
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,320
including um kate put on this amazing

709
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,679
set of conversations called i think it

710
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,240
was text trains and tits is that right

711
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
um about sort of the history of kind of

712
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
sex work and platforms and

713
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,919
infrastructure um is that you know

714
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,480
platforms will use sex work

715
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,720
sex sex workers sex workers labor sex

716
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,799
workers expertise to kind of build up an

717
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,720
initial user base and then once that

718
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,480
like they've got that once they have

719
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
folks on the platform they'll begin

720
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,919
making it harder and harder for sex

721
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,600
marketers to work on those platforms and

722
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,120
in some ways what angela was talking

723
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,799
about with only fans like folks very

724
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,880
much saw that as a really good example

725
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,720
of kind of this dynamic right where it's

726
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
like oh yes like only fans became

727
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,279
incredibly popular as a result of

728
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,159
sex worker labor um and then you have

729
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,480
not like a variety of different folks

730
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,559
joining the platform and then only fans

731
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,080
under pressure is like well maybe we

732
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,679
could get get rid of the sex worker

733
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,600
folks that didn't go so well

734
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
um so that makes me a little nervous

735
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,320
about kind of pushing on vcs in order to

736
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
kind of talk about funding in this space

737
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,600
because you know in the absence of real

738
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
uh meaningful accountability to

739
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,159
community to specifically sex worker

740
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,480
community and sexual communities

741
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,159
um you know i feel like it's just gonna

742
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,919
be the same thing again the other thing

743
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,880
i will say about this is um

744
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,799
you know i work with a small number of

745
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,200
platforms that are interested in making

746
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
things suck less for the sex workers

747
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,120
that are on them um

748
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,159
and through my legal practice and

749
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,760
there aren't a lot of people who do that

750
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,279
people sometimes ask me for referrals

751
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,720
and i'm like i honestly don't know who i

752
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,400
would send you to um

753
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,440
but

754
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,720
you know there

755
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,880
it is um

756
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,400
very

757
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,279
i think

758
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,919
it is very difficult imagine if

759
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,840
basically all of the infrastructure you

760
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
use all of the large platforms you are

761
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,840
just waiting for them to kick you off

762
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,880
right so

763
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
um there's a there's a website called

764
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,960
twitter um which was sex worker twitter

765
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,880
which is a group based out of australia

766
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,559
really some really cool folks doing cool

767
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,559
work out of australia where you know at

768
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,320
least in some parts of australia sex

769
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,720
worker sex work is um asymmetrically

770
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
decriminalized which means that it's

771
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
legal to sell sex but it's not legal to

772
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,320
buy it that that model sucks and we can

773
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
talk about that if we need to but like

774
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
that means it's not illegal to do sex

775
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,480
work um when twitter was sort of getting

776
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,720
launched i believe um there i'm actually

777
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,480
not going to name the platform because

778
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,760
i'm not sure on the details and i don't

779
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,000
want to call anybody out unnecessarily

780
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,760
but they were working with they were

781
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
trying to use basically a platform that

782
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,760
many of you would probably use to launch

783
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,880
a website right um that you know allows

784
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
you to scale more quickly and that

785
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
platform was basically like we can't

786
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,360
serve your website you just can't use

787
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
our platform so it's not just that like

788
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
oh you know the vcs won't fund it or

789
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,120
even if the vcs do fund it you're going

790
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,799
to be under vc pressure to kick the sex

791
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,399
workers off once it gets to critical

792
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,799
mass but also many of the tools that you

793
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,120
would use to effectively build a modern

794
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
you know website that would be sort of

795
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,120
responsive and you know

796
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,760
good in the same ways that we expect

797
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,159
websites to be now are just unavailable

798
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,720
because if you specifically focus on

799
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,960
serving sex workers they will kick you

800
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,760
off in part they may claim because of

801
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,200
potential foster liability

802
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,240
yeah um angela i know you've seen some

803
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,480
kind of participatory action work from

804
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,399
folks kind of working on building their

805
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,320
own platforms don't know if you want to

806
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,000
you know respond to some of what

807
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,320
kendrick said there or any examples

808
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,360
where people are building successfully

809
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,600
um so we have seen some folks trying to

810
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,000
build out alternative platforms whether

811
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,240
that's for example a kind of sex worker

812
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,399
run and lead alternative to only fans

813
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,520
given that

814
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,399
the

815
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,399
largest um platforms for advertising

816
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,120
full-service sex work are

817
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,840
owned by a very very small cohort of the

818
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,919
same affluent um

819
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,480
folks um we've seen folks creating their

820
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,360
own platforms for advertising services

821
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,919
which in some ways is reassuring but in

822
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,520
other ways i don't think that we should

823
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,000
wholly rely on sex workers to do all of

824
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
this labor and i guess speaking to some

825
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,760
of what kendra was saying what they were

826
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,080
saying towards the end i think you know

827
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,200
i believe in the importance of um

828
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,080
as you were starting to say a

829
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,760
participatory action

830
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,000
and folks sex workers have this really

831
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
famous mantra right um nothing about us

832
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,640
without us and so if there are folk

833
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
species or other spaces

834
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,440
that are looking to conduct any research

835
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,799
or any actions um that should involve

836
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,440
sex workers right so put another way if

837
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
tech companies for example are

838
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
interested in creating more inclusive

839
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,399
spaces or addressing any of the threats

840
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,320
discussed here today i'd argue that

841
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
developing those strategies should

842
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,960
always be done in consultation with sex

843
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,960
workers

844
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,240
thanks angela much appreciated uh so

845
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,399
another question that we have coming in

846
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,440
is if y'all could speak a bit to some of

847
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,080
the spillover effects here you know what

848
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,559
are the similarities between

849
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,559
the situations that sex workers

850
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,640
experience and those faced by other

851
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,799
groups which maybe they're a part of or

852
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,120
just you know similar to in certain ways

853
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,880
and then are there any particular you

854
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,960
know ways in which this population is

855
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,360
especially unique um that you think

856
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,960
folks should have in mind as they're

857
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,679
designing and building products

858
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,000
uh kate i might ask you to start with

859
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,120
that one

860
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,480
yeah um

861
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,840
and

862
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,480
i know i don't see the uh the slack so

863
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,919
if i'm answering a different question

864
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,640
that's being asked totally feel free um

865
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,000
but yeah it's

866
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
you know when we're talking about

867
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,120
kicking off sex workers when we're

868
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,720
talking about removing sex workers

869
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,120
that's generally not the end of where

870
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,640
this kind of stuff

871
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,559
goes and so there was actually a recent

872
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,279
study um it was really small that came

873
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,120
out of the uk that looked at parental

874
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,039
controls and what was being excluded and

875
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,760
almost every single one of them excluded

876
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,000
the trevor project exclu which is for

877
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,799
lgbtq and especially trans youth um

878
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,279
excluded uh really mainstream lgbtq

879
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,760
content um and and more than half

880
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,200
excluded information from planned

881
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,519
parenthood when we're looking at

882
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,760
what happened after the bans on abortion

883
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,279
access in texas moved through and the

884
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,679
liability expanded what was removed off

885
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,440
of instagram almost immediately was

886
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,039
information about how to access

887
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,440
self-managed abortions and self-managed

888
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,840
abortions uh are

889
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,480
i'm not gonna go into that but it is an

890
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,640
incredibly important resource for people

891
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,399
who now all of a sudden are 300 miles

892
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,600
away from their nearest abortion

893
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,519
provider and so

894
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,360
when we're talking about you know sex

895
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,720
workers going for sex workers being the

896
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,120
canary in the coal mine

897
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,919
it is not the end of where it goes it is

898
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,039
not a coincidence that foster sesta

899
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,039
really talked about commercial sexual

900
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,200
exchange it talked about facilitation of

901
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
prostitution and what comes out

902
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
immediately after is earn it which has a

903
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,360
much broader conversation around sex it

904
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
has a much broader conversation around

905
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,760
all pornography which

906
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
we i thought we had settled that like

907
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,840
50 years ago i have this thing called

908
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
the first amendment

909
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,640
and

910
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,960
and that's not a coincidence and so the

911
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,240
spillover is really cascading down and i

912
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,840
think what we're talking about is

913
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,159
ultimately respectability politics the

914
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,679
difference between

915
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,519
sex work and sex workers and then

916
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,039
reproductive justice and abortion after

917
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,679
that and lgbtq spaces and trans spaces

918
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,960
in particular are who is stigmatized

919
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,039
most who is most excluded

920
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,200
then trailing down from there because

921
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,360
sex work is not the target sex work is

922
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,880
the first target

923
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,960
and so when we're talking about these

924
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,039
bands they're never going to be

925
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,320
exclusive they're never going to be

926
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
narrow and they're not going to be the

927
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,279
scalpel that that people advertise them

928
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,480
as

929
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,200
um and and

930
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,559
you know stigma is something i also

931
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,320
really want to kind of name in this

932
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,640
space because it makes sex work really

933
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,039
easy to target and that includes from

934
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,559
you know tech spaces and when we're

935
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,399
talking about morality clauses this

936
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,240
conversation around morality clauses and

937
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,840
venture capitalist funding would not

938
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,760
happen if their morality clause was was

939
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,240
about lgbtq spaces and it's because a

940
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,960
lot of you know tech areas are pretty

941
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,399
confident that they are queer friendly

942
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,760
that they want to be that they want to

943
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,679
protect that they understand

944
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,440
that that is you know

945
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,360
an area that deserves protection

946
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
deserves space that when

947
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,200
queer kids are looking for basic

948
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,559
information about their bodies and their

949
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,720
lives and their development that they're

950
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,240
not going to find that in schools and so

951
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
access to technology access to digital

952
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,000
spaces becomes that much more important

953
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,840
we know that we've had that conversation

954
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,919
and in a lot of tech spaces that is you

955
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,600
know a baseline and if a venture

956
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,279
capitalist came up and said i will give

957
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,120
you money but if there's anything

958
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,960
remotely gay on this site it's going

959
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,519
down no one would ever accept that

960
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,679
but we do it for sex work because it's

961
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,720
just easier because you're gonna not get

962
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,399
a lot of the anti-sex work backlash

963
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,480
because in kosi and morality in the

964
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,919
media who does have you know anti-lgbtq

965
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,799
hate groups on their board and yet are

966
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,879
still being talked to on the hill are

967
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,199
still being interviewed by magazines and

968
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,040
put forward as a mainstream organization

969
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,480
because they expressly hate sex work

970
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,199
all of those are really comfortable

971
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,520
and a lot of it i have to say is because

972
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,480
of the internalized anti-sex work bias

973
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,320
the the dirtiness

974
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,719
that still is really pervasive and a lot

975
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,440
of

976
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,359
a lot of technology spaces because it's

977
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,280
an uncomfortable conversation

978
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,079
and uh and and one that still has to has

979
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,000
to happen and the only way for us to

980
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,320
move forward is if those conversations

981
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,040
if we can talk about sex workers without

982
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,800
yes this dichotomy of like the sex work

983
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,480
is over there and the technology is over

984
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,280
here and you know yes there's these

985
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,839
websites but that's not who we are

986
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,159
when ultimately yeah as kendra was

987
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
saying like sex workers and the sex

988
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,079
industry built a lot of technology if

989
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,720
you want to look at who mainstreamed um

990
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
streaming platforms it was porn if you

991
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,880
want to look at the two um

992
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,640
internet-based subscription services

993
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
that were the biggest at the very

994
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,280
beginning it was the wall street journal

995
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,720
and it was a stripper named danny in

996
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,920
seattle

997
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,000
and so when we're talking about you know

998
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,920
who is central to this conversation and

999
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,839
who needs to be included and the reason

1000
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,680
why they're not it is sex workers and it

1001
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,160
is stigma

1002
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,560
thank you kate uh angela you know i

1003
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,160
don't know from your kind of

1004
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,400
intersectional disability research if

1005
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,160
there's anything that you'd like to add

1006
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,880
here

1007
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,760
yeah absolutely thank you so much kate i

1008
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,599
think everything that kate was saying

1009
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,440
was so spot on and especially in

1010
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,200
relationship to the importance of

1011
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,880
thinking about stigma

1012
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,480
as part of this broad conversation we're

1013
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,520
having and anything especially oh as you

1014
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,040
were noting i think thinking about

1015
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,280
stigma using an intersectional frame or

1016
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,000
perspective is also incredibly important

1017
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,640
right so any policy or forms of stigma

1018
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,520
or stigma that we discuss are surely to

1019
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,960
have some universal or baseline effect

1020
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,160
on all workers right but race gender

1021
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,640
ability class and so on are all going to

1022
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,200
compound these effects right so sex

1023
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,960
workers often publicly discuss the

1024
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,400
importance of examining what they

1025
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,640
colloquially call the hierarchy which

1026
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,960
refers to a stratification system within

1027
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,440
the sex industry whereby for example

1028
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,599
full service sex work is located at the

1029
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,400
bottom right and labor such as canning

1030
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
and maybe pro dom work is situated at

1031
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,119
the top of that hierarchy so given that

1032
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,359
some forms of sex work are criminalized

1033
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,000
and heavily policed and others not so

1034
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,480
much this creates a system whereby some

1035
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,040
sex workers faced far more stigma and

1036
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,760
harm than others right and in further

1037
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,160
one's identity and social location

1038
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,880
shapes stigma and state persecution

1039
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,880
right and as kate was talking about

1040
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,960
so just as an example if you look for

1041
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,280
example at new zealand right their

1042
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,440
decriminalization model is often held up

1043
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,079
as like the gold standard right but yet

1044
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,079
when they passed the prostitution reform

1045
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,200
act in 2003 it only decriminalized sex

1046
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,040
work for new zealand citizens and

1047
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,599
holders of permanent residency and

1048
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,920
intentionally excluded migrant sex

1049
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,119
workers under section 19 of the act so

1050
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,960
migrant sex workers still face

1051
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,839
deportation threats of incarceration so

1052
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,640
using this example just to just to argue

1053
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,920
and that racism and xenophobia also

1054
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,400
shape the stigma that's happening and so

1055
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,480
again i'm just using these examples to

1056
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,960
say that especially when we're thinking

1057
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,599
about interventions um we should not

1058
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,960
paint all sex workers with a broad bosch

1059
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,200
yes

1060
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,400
can i tag it real quick yeah yeah so i

1061
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
think yeah just to sort of add to what

1062
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,720
angela and kate were saying i think the

1063
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,160
other thing that has been really helpful

1064
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,480
for me to understand and i want to sort

1065
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,079
of really credit my colleague danielle

1066
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,760
blunt who like really i think has been

1067
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
thinking about and talking about this

1068
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,880
is that you know these types of uh

1069
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,920
platform and algorithmic um sort of

1070
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,320
suppression of sex worker speech don't

1071
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,119
just affect actual sex workers they and

1072
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,280
also affect people who look like sex

1073
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,040
workers and that really gets to what

1074
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,800
angela was saying about sort of like you

1075
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,839
know the inter like the way uh sort of

1076
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,839
stigma and intersectionality shapes how

1077
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,760
folks experience this and i want to give

1078
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,720
a non-digital example um because i think

1079
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,599
that it uh it will help illustrate what

1080
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,200
you know what this might look like

1081
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,320
digitally

1082
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,079
but so folks might be familiar with the

1083
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,400
idea of like walking while trans bands

1084
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,040
um so this is a form of basically uh

1085
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,119
their laws that um

1086
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,079
basically either p prohibit uh loitering

1087
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,400
for the purposes of prostitution um so

1088
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,079
this is like you're standing around and

1089
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:46,960
i think

1090
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,440
i the cop think you might engage in some

1091
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,440
prostitution so i'm going to arrest you

1092
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,520
and the reason that folks call these

1093
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
walking while trans bans is they are

1094
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,480
predominantly used to police literally

1095
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,200
the uh women of color trans women of

1096
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,760
color who are exist in public space

1097
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,599
independent of whether those folks are

1098
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,000
engaged in sex work or not and you know

1099
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,079
like it shouldn't matter but it does

1100
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,920
right and

1101
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,000
they were basically these laws which are

1102
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,640
theoretically facially neutral end up

1103
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,320
really having these dramatic negative

1104
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,480
impacts on the lives of trans women of

1105
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,960
color because they are presumed to be

1106
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,119
sex workers because many trans women of

1107
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,440
color are sex workers but some you know

1108
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,040
aren't or aren't engaged in sex work at

1109
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
that particular moment and i think when

1110
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,960
we think about sort of algorithmic

1111
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,880
suppression of speech online you know

1112
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
we're seeing kind of the some of the

1113
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,079
equivalence of what it looks like well

1114
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,560
to the walking wall trans bands where

1115
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,920
you know it doesn't matter if you're

1116
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,920
engaged in sex work or not you know if

1117
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,320
you look if your algorithmically look

1118
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,880
like a sex worker as you know um as my

1119
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,960
colleague blunt would say you know you

1120
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,119
can end up facing the same kinds of you

1121
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,880
know search suppression or facing the

1122
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,400
same kinds of getting kicked off

1123
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,920
platforms um because you know it it's

1124
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,839
not it's not necessarily precisely

1125
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,839
targeted to folks who are engaging in

1126
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,400
particular forms of work of sex work the

1127
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,079
other thing just to build on what angela

1128
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,560
said about the hierarchy here is that

1129
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,040
you know i don't talk a lot about legal

1130
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,920
versus illegal sex work in my work um in

1131
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,000
part because like

1132
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,200
it is

1133
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
incredibly difficult to probably

1134
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,599
basically impossible for any platform to

1135
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,599
actually be able to make a call about

1136
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,520
whether certain forms of sex work are

1137
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,040
legal or illegal and let me give you an

1138
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,160
example

1139
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
in new york um

1140
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,560
pro like being a dominatrix is legal

1141
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,839
like bdsm for pay is legal i mean that

1142
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,520
doesn't mean it can't be criminalized or

1143
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,280
you can't face you know potential police

1144
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,200
crackdowns but like the text of the law

1145
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,720
right about what constitutes

1146
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,119
prostitution does not include

1147
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,720
um certain kinds of domination that

1148
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,960
don't sort of result in sexual contact

1149
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,720
that's not true in other states in the

1150
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,359
united states right so is

1151
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,480
you know being a pro dom is that legal

1152
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,200
sex work is it illegal sex work like

1153
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,079
you know

1154
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,760
i could tell you if you gave me a full

1155
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
description and a couple of weeks to do

1156
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,520
the research theoretically right but

1157
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,839
like functionally you know when we talk

1158
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,880
about you know i want to sort of urge us

1159
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,800
to not sort of try to parse that too

1160
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,079
narrowly and be like oh yeah we just

1161
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,280
need to figure out the difference

1162
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,119
between the legal form and the illegal

1163
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,640
form and then we'll do it from there

1164
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,240
because a you know

1165
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,440
targeting

1166
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,880
we're not you know we're not very good

1167
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,480
at figuring out what legal or illegal

1168
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,920
sex work is right you know there's a

1169
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
reason that the supreme court joke is

1170
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
like pornography you know the definition

1171
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,359
is i know it when i see it it's just

1172
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,720
because it's basically really hard to

1173
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,640
figure out also

1174
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,440
very brief aside very small moment of

1175
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,520
nerdery the reason that's

1176
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,960
the thing that people say about

1177
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,640
pornography that the supreme court

1178
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,319
justice said about pornography is

1179
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,240
because in order to judge whether things

1180
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,160
were obscene the supreme court used to

1181
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,040
sit in the basement of the of the the

1182
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,119
supreme court building and all nine

1183
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,960
justices would watch

1184
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,800
pornographic films to figure out whether

1185
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,680
they were obscene or not um so like when

1186
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,359
they say i know it when i see it it's

1187
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,599
not just like oh like haha theoretical

1188
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,440
it's like literally that like there are

1189
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,040
nine dudes down there trying to figure

1190
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,520
out if this constitutes obscene or porn

1191
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,280
um and then when sandra j o'connor

1192
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,560
joined the court they were like maybe

1193
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,400
this is a little awkward

1194
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,760
anyway

1195
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,480
aside so what was i talking about anyway

1196
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,800
so right the idea you know thinking

1197
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,200
about just not again in the way that

1198
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,400
we've kind of been trying to trouble

1199
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,079
some of the binaries i think folks go to

1200
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,319
for easy regulatory purposes or easy

1201
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,079
argumentation right thinking about legal

1202
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,839
versus illegal sex work doesn't tend to

1203
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,480
be particularly effective and we often

1204
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,319
end up including folks who are in

1205
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,240
marginalized poc specifically folks who

1206
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,839
are in marginalized populations or

1207
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,160
precarious situations in what looks like

1208
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,680
a sex worker independent of whether

1209
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,440
they're engaged in any form of sex work

1210
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,760
at all

1211
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,640
thank you yeah

1212
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,079
very very good uh answers that we have

1213
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,680
okay we're starting to have a bunch of

1214
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,720
questions

1215
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,200
um coming in from the slack and so

1216
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,839
um the first one up on the queue

1217
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,960
is you know how aggressive has foster

1218
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,040
sesta prosecution been we talked about

1220
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,520
written about this um and kind of who's

1221
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,000
the motor behind the movement um and i

1222
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,560
want to you know add to those

1223
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,160
questions you know there's a new act um

1224

congress that perhaps you know kate or

1227
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,680
kendra do you want to explain to us a

1228
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,800
little bit about sort of the evolving uh

1229
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,040
legislative policy situation in this

1230
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,599
area you know anything more you can say

1231

about you know what the response has

1232
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,359
been and kind of where that's coming

1233
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,040
from

1234
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,800

i can try

1237
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,520
um so how many successful prosecutions

1238
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,040
have there been under earn it well the

1239
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,640
answer is there has been one federal

1240
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,640
criminal prosecution that we know of or

1241
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,280
sorry under oh my god under foster jesus

1242
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,839
i'm getting ahead of myself um

1243
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,280
and sadly um but under foster it was of

1244
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,000
a guy named who ran a platform called

1245
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
city x guide

1246
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,040
you know

1247
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,839
uh it he was not prosecuted he was

1248
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,319
prosecuted under section 2421a which is

1249
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,480
the new federal criminal provision for

1250
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,400
operating a platform that promotes or

1251
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,680
facilitates uh prostitution notably he

1252
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,760
was not prosecuted either for promotion

1253
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,359
of sex trafficking nor for sex

1254
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,359
trafficking they never you know even the

1255
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,839
criminal indictment for that um against

1256
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,400
that platform never successful never

1257
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,200
even alleged that or never alleged

1258
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,359
specifically with charges that there was

1259
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,960
like that they could

1260
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,200
tie it to particular instances of sex

1261
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,319
trafficking

1262
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,240
the thing that has happened post-fasta

1263
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,400
other than the x guide prosecution which

1264
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,000
is like the one example of a criminal

1265
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,560
prosecution that's happened um a federal

1266
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,079
criminal prosecution that's happened is

1267
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,800
there been a number of civil lawsuits of

1268
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,720
sort of varying

1269
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,119
quality let's go with that

1270
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,280
and i think you know

1271
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,680
the some of these lawsuits have

1272
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,000
not

1273
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,440
have been brought even though the the

1274
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,920
the sort of conduct that they allege by

1275
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,640
online platforms has not um really

1276
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,880
doesn't align with what foster's literal

1277
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,800
text says should be

1278
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,200
immune from section 230 and that's

1279
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,599
resulted in sort of varying different

1280
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,839
outcomes in the courts eric goldman here

1281
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,200
at santa clara has done a really good

1282
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,960
job of kind of cataloging all of this

1283
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
and one of the things we've seen is that

1284
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,560
you know in some cases judges including

1285
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,880
um the texas supreme court have

1286
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,119
basically said ah screw what the the law

1287
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,640
actually says like we want to

1288
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,280
potentially hold facebook liable um for

1289
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,200
this this particular instance of sex

1290
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,000
trafficking what is notable and really

1291
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,319
important and you'll you'll get the sort

1292
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,720
of even better download this tomorrow

1293
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,440
during the 230 panel but even in the

1294
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,079
absence of 230 immunity 230 immunity is

1295
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,680
kind of just like all right like you

1296
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,599
know you can get the lawsuit thrown out

1297
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,200
super early

1298
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,800
right um

1299
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,359
even in the absence of 230 immunity

1300
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,359
there is basically very little evidence

1301
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,359
that many of these online platforms knew

1302
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,560
anything about the alleged bad conduct

1303
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,319
or like the alleged trafficking that

1304
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,880
plaintiffs are talking about right that

1305
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,280
and that's actually the legal standard

1306
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,040
right it can't just be that it happened

1307
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
on your platform right you know that's

1308
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,160
not that's not grounds for liability um

1309
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,599
under uh section 1595 so the federal sex

1310
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,599
trafficking bit of the sex trafficking

1311
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,160
law that uh allows for civil claims

1312
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,319
claims by an individual against a

1313
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,280
company for example um so it's quite

1314
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,359
probable that the actual outcome of all

1315
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,040
of this litigation will be that the

1316
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,280
platforms that are being sued will win

1317
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,520
right because they it is unlikely in

1318
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,040
many of these cases that they had the

1319
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,680
requisite amount of knowledge um in to

1320
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,800
sort of be held liable of course you

1321
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,319
know this is what the conversation about

1322
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,160
section 230 is about which is that it's

1323
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,079
going to take much longer for them to

1324
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,720
sort of reach that conclusion um you

1325
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,200
know we haven't really seen

1326
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,440
i think

1327
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,319
yeah i think we haven't really seen

1328
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,000
um

1329
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,119
very many

1330
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,200
examples if any of lawsuits where

1331
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,480
there's you know really the kind of

1332
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,960
knowledge of sex trafficking that would

1333
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,760
that one would think of um and one's

1334
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,359
sort of invoked by people who are

1335
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,880
looking for the passage of foster the

1336
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,960
sort of idea that these platforms were

1337
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,200
involved in like you know trafficking

1338
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,720
folks beyond sort of being a kind of

1339
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,119
neutral communications intermediary um

1340
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,880
we haven't really seen

1341
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,960
successful or really any allegations

1342
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,880
allegations of that

1343
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,880
yeah and one thing i wanted to add on to

1344
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,599
the foster prosecutions is that so

1345
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,200
cityx guide when that went down by the

1346
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,640
way uh

1347
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,720
hacking hustling we work together we uh

1348
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,119
i work with hacking costling as well and

1349
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,680
when we put up our

1350
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,280
press release literally just talking

1351
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,280
about the fact that city x guide had

1352
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
been pulled down these were the charges

1353
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,640
um that was uh blocked on twitter that

1354
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,800
post specifically about city x guide so

1355
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,400
when you talk about not just the way

1356
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,640
that this is impacting um folks at trade

1357
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,640
sex organizing has taken a massive hit

1358
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,400
and so when we're talking about like you

1359
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,920
know how do we talk to the to the sex

1360
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,119
workers why aren't sex workers

1361
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,599
organizing what we can't

1362
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,839
and it's because all of the platforms

1363
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,680
that we keep using to try to organize to

1364
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,240
try to build community to try to combat

1365
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,119
the isolation and the lack of knowledge

1366
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,640
that leads people to take undue risk to

1367
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,319
literally just distribute information

1368
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,400
about like this is what harm reduction

1369
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,480
looks like when you're trading sex this

1370
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,559
is how you negotiate for condoms with

1371
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,359
clients this is how you screen clients

1372
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,839
to make sure that they are safe here's a

1373
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,599
bad date list where you can report

1374
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,319
negative encounters where you can find

1375
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,760
out if the person that you're about to

1376
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,680
see has a history of rape or assault

1377
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,720
that's being decimated too

1378
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,200
and as an organizer it has gotten harder

1379
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
and harder i can't hashtag sex work i

1380
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,839
can't hashtag sex worker i can't hashtag

1381
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,760
sex workers work i can't distribute

1382
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,920
information on platforms we need

1383
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,359
listservs and listservs by the way we're

1384
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,160
covered by foster zesta

1385
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,160
list serves the way that we distribute

1386
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,359
basic information the way that we

1387
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,960
connect to each other outside of

1388
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,319
physical space and you can imagine how

1389
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,480
important that was during kovid all of

1390
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,880
that is being targeted and decimated

1391
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,359
right alongside these platforms

1392
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,839
and so when we're talking about uh

1393
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,079
foster and prosecutions

1394
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,000
city exide was not the first website to

1395
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,680
have been taken down there was a number

1396
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,480
before

1397
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,240
and foster was just one of the charges

1398
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,839
and the thing is that whether we're

1399
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,280
talking about

1400
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,440
my red book which was 2015 whether we're

1401
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,960
talking about rent boy which is you know

1402
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,319
a couple years later whether we're

1403
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,839
talking about backpage all of them have

1404
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,280
the same charges and those were

1405
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,280
promotion of prostitution local charges

1406
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,440
that were upgraded through the the

1407
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,599
travel act which because of the internet

1408
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,440
you can basically federalize state

1409
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,480
charges

1410
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,480
prostitute promotion of prostitution

1411
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
because they had some email evidence

1412
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,079
that people knew that they were trading

1413
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,000
sex on their site kind of broadly and

1414
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,520
then money laundering charges around

1415
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,040
that where they would seize all of the

1416
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,119
assets of everyone they were charging

1417
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,079
and

1418
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,839
none of these have ever also gone to

1419
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,760
trial except for now the back page case

1420
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
looks like it might every single one has

1421
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,240
pled out and pled out mostly to money

1422
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,599
laundering charges so if we're talking

1423
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,839
about who's actually being targeted

1424
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,200
who's being charged and then what they

1425
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,880
end up with and what charges are

1426
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,640
sticking we're not talking about

1427
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,640
anything remotely related to harm or

1428
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,000
victimization we're generally talking

1429
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,680
about money laundering charges that are

1430
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,839
coming through promotion of prostitution

1431
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,440
and so a sexual a successful

1432
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,520
foster prosecution has not happened but

1433
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,079
neither has a successful sex trafficking

1434
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,680
prosecution that is exclusive

1435
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,319
exclusively related to

1436
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,160
fostering a website there's somewhere

1437
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,839
there's been intersections a couple

1438
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,000
where it was a trafficking charge and

1439
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,680
they happened to host their own website

1440
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,040
where they would advertise but that's

1441
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,480
not the same thing as what we're talking

1442
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,319
about here those are trafficking charges

1443
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,720
that just happen to involve a website

1444
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,880
but there's actually not been a website

1445
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,520
that was not directly actively

1446
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,119
involved in trafficking of people where

1447
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,119
hosting that website has ever even been

1448
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,720
charged with something related to

1449
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,480
trafficking

1450
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,040
um as far as the evolution

1451
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,720
of kind of what

1452
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,280
is happening and and i apologize for not

1453
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,280
kind of contextualizing this in a lot of

1454
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,839
the other tech legislation um because

1455
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,839
that's not my my bailiwick and i

1456
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:36,880
generally don't understand what they're

1457
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,920
talking about

1458
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,319
but as far as

1459
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,240
anybody else oh thank you definitely not

1460
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,359
the people who are writing these things

1461
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:44,400
yeah but

1462
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,079
when we're talking about you know

1463
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,240
trafficking and and those pieces and

1464
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,599
csam

1465
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,440
there has generally been a broadening of

1466
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,040
every time this happens

1467
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,839
and earn it now kind of broadens this

1468
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,559
idea of we're gonna we're gonna expand

1469
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,559
your liability we're gonna expand

1470
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,079
criminal and civil liability and

1471
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,440
especially civil liability because

1472
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,040
that's really important to these

1473
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,079
websites and we're going to do it in

1474
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,520
these different ways

1475
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,119
and that was actually that was really

1476
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,160
intentional um before foster sesta there

1477
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,640
was um something the justice for victims

1478
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,760
of trafficking act which happened a

1479
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,359
couple years before

1480
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,720
and what that did was actually look to

1481
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,319
expand the criminal federal definition

1482
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,559
of trafficking really targeting backpage

1483
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,079
it was the same actors it was the same

1484
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,680
people who were who eventually ended up

1485
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,920
pushing foster sesta who were pushing

1486
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,839
that provision of the jvta they expanded

1487
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,760
the trafficking definition to include

1488
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,079
people that advertised victim victims of

1489
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,839
trafficking well it was a criminal

1490
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,520
prosecution which means it has to go

1491
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,880
through the department of justice who

1492
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,400
then has to analyze the language and

1493
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,319
give guidance on what they mean by that

1494
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,119
and

1495
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,720
the department of justice read this and

1496
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,800
said we're going to interpret this to

1497
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,480
basically say if you are trafficking

1498
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
someone and you post an ad

1499
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,200
that counts as an act of trafficking

1500
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,960
this doesn't mean we're going to go

1501
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,400
after backpage which is what they were

1502
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,520
trying to do

1503
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,440
and so that passed and the department of

1504
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,280
justice said this is actually not

1505
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,400
trafficking this is not what we're

1506
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
looking to prosecute criminally

1507
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,319
and so what happened was cesta was

1508
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,240
developed and sesto was developed as an

1509
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,160
expansion of civil liability that also

1510
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,119
expanded who could sue so when kendra is

1511
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,800
talking about the number of civil

1512
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,839
lawsuits proliferating that was really

1513
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,680
intentional and that was because they

1514
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,960
weren't getting the same criminal

1515
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,480
penalties because it is a pretty high

1516
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,680
standard

1517
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,480
for

1518
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,319
going after these websites and so

1519
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,640
switching over to a civil liability and

1520
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,119
expanding who could sue civilly

1521
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,520
was a very intentional act to encourage

1522
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,280
these civil lawsuits

1523
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,680
and so what has happened since then is

1524
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,200
they had this provision around

1525
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,800
specifically commercial sex and

1526
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,559
apparently that wasn't good enough and

1527
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,880
so what earn it is is actually a further

1528
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,040
expansion where they say we're not going

1529
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,480
to talk about

1530
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,319
any kind of specific charge we're not

1531
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,760
going to talk about this over here what

1532
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,839
we're going to do is have a panel which

1533
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,559
is vastly dominated by

1534
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:57,520
criminal

1535
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,160
uh criminal justice folks that is house

1536
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,839
of the department of justice that says

1537
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,400
this issue of harm this issue of child

1538
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,400
abuse is predominantly and almost

1539
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,559
exclusively an issue of criminal justice

1540
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,240
it's not an issue of public health it's

1541
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,920
not an issue of trauma it's not an issue

1542
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,200
of the fact that we are desperately

1543
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,440
under funding services to families it's

1544
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,119
not an issue of identification and the

1545
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,880
fact that people who are experiencing

1546
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,640
harm don't actually come forward and

1547
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,160
report this because of a lot of

1548
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,960
different structural reasons it's about

1549
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,960
websites and it's about prosecution of

1550
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,839
websites and if you don't certify to

1551
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,160
whatever decisions that we make

1552
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,000
then you lose your liability or then you

1553
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,799
lose your liability protections and so

1554
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,839
this issue is not one of criminal

1555
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:42,000
justice and who's being prosecuted this

1556
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,280
is an issue of self-censorship for fear

1557
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,000
of civil liability first and foremost it

1558
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,880
is not an unintended consequence it is

1559
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,119
the specific intention of this pattern

1560
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,680
