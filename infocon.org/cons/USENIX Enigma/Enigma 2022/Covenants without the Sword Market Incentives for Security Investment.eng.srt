1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,639
hi my name is web of gerk i'm the senior

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,320
director for cyber security public

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,360
policy and research at comcast cable

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
today i'll be presenting my talk titled

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,920
comments without the sword market

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,720
incentives for cyber security investment

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,880
so before i begin i want to give an

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,760
overview of what the talk is about

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,800
so very quickly about two decades of

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
research in the economics of cyber

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,079
security

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,120
has focused on market incentives to

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
invest in security solutions

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,640
this research primarily makes the

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,360
argument that companies

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
tend to under provision

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
and under invest in security because

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
they're not adequate incentives to

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,280
invest in security

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,719
and then they make the argument that we

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,520
need policy solutions to address this

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,120
misalignment

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
and under provisioning

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,960
at the same time

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,040
if you look at the cyber security market

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,000
itself

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,280
it has expanded for 3.5 billions in 2004

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
to potentially more than 1 trillion in

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,600
2025

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,000
so there's certainly some incentives to

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,560
invest in security and especially i'm

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,159
going to be talking about seven market

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,200
incentives to invest in cyber security

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,040
these incentives

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
have led not only

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
to technical

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
to investments and technical solutions

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,079
but also

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,759
adoption of secure protocols like ssh

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,119
as well as

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,920
security commitments like the abcs for

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,880
isps such as the anti-botnet code for

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,280
internet service providers as well as

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,560
cross-sector

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,040
efforts like the c2 consensus to create

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
a baseline for iot security

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,399
so to start

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
why is information security hard

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,960
about two decades ago professor ross

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,040
anderson made the observation that we

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
often think of information security

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,560
as primarily a technical problem and

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,318
because we think of it as a technical

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,360
problem

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,680
we try to find technical solutions to

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,200
that problem

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
but he made the observation that

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
information security is not just about

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
technology but it's also impinged by

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
economic incentives

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,560
to invest in information security or or

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
to not invest in information security

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
specifically he

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
he he argued that most customers may

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
have a hard time differentiating between

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,200
a secure product and its insecure

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,519
alternative and because customers cannot

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
make that differentiation they would be

69
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,440
they would be unwilling to pay for a

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,959
more expensive

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,280
albeit more secure product

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,120
and because customers are not willing to

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,840
pay for the price of building additional

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,280
security

75
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,599
vendors would be

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,120
disincentivized

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,159
to

78
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,720
spend additional budget to build

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,959
additional security into their products

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,200
so over time this leads to a market of

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,800
security lemons uh where

82
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,720
neither customers nor

83
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,840
vendors

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,879
are putting any any money into security

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,640
now even if customers were able to

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,239
differentiate secure products for

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,760
insecure ones

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
the cost of insecure devices is

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
typically born neither by the vendor nor

90
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
by

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
the buyer uh so

92
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,159
professor anderson made the argument

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,760
that uh if if you have a camera that uh

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
that gets breached and is used to

95
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,599
conduct a ddos attack

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,480
well

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,599
the cost of that insecurity is not being

98
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,640
born

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,480
by by the customer who bought the

100
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,159
insecure camera or by the uh the

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,319
the vendor who sold that insecure camera

102
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,400
but the third party uh that gets

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,439
victimized by the ddos attack

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,680
and then finally uh

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,760
yeah as is the case with many

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,120
information

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,879
and cyber products

108
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,000
the the value of those products and or

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,239
services or platforms or what have you

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,400
it often correlates with the number of

111
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
people using that particular service or

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,519
product

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,000
uh so the more people you have on that

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,839
platform the more valuable it's going to

115
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,320
be and if you add security well that can

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
add us that can act as friction and can

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
prevent adoption so to address those

118
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
network effects uh

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,919
the the provider of that particular

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,240
platform or service or product uh might

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,639
want to under provision security because

122
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
and thereby drive adoption

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
and there there's certainly examples

124
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,040
that we can see uh that that

125
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,900
sort of

126
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,360
[Music]

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,320
refi these arguments so

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,960
if you're in the market to buy a smart

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,160
tv

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
it can be hard to differentiate a smart

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
uh secure smart tv from an insecure

132
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,039
smart tv um if you're in the market to

133
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
buy a smart camera as we saw with the

134
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,440
mirai botnet attack uh it was used to

135
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,520
target a third-party dine and did not

136
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
have an impact on the people who bought

137
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,039
the camera or the people who are selling

138
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
the camera and then finally if you have

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
a smart tv and you have a smart camera

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,680
and you're trying to buy a set of smart

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,039
speakers

142
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,720
one of your first criteria is going to

143
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
be whether those smart speakers are

144
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
going to be interoperable with the smart

145
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,840
tv and the and the smart camera

146
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
and and perhaps

147
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,280
it is possible that

148
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
a highly secure uh smart

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,479
set of smart speakers would have a

150
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
harder time um interoper

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,199
being interoperable with the smart tv or

152
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,000
the smart camera

153
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,520
and that

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,479
means that you know we we get

155
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,039
that there is this assumption that

156
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,759
vendors will will build in less security

157
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
and that's that's often reflected in

158
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,600
the

159
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
increase in news stories that we see

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,919
around security so maybe two 20 years

161
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,080
ago you'd see

162
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
two new stories about websites getting

163
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,319
hacked and maybe today you see 10 news

164
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,400
stories about websites getting hacked

165
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,039
but what that ignores is that 20 years

166
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,000
ago maybe you only had 10 websites

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
two of which got hacked whereas today we

168
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,199
may have a 100 websites 10 of which got

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,280
hacked so even though

170
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,440
20 years ago you only saw two new

171
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,800
stories the actual success rate of cyber

172
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,639
attacks was 20

173
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,280
and whereas today while you do see a lot

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
more

175
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
stories about websites getting hacked

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,520
the actual success rate is only 10

177
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
and

178
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,240
in fact professor eric jardine from

179
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,800
virginia tech makes the argument that

180
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,319
cyberspace

181
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,440
even though

182
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,919
it might feel otherwise is actually

183
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,280
safer than we

184
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,360
typically tend to think

185
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,479
because while new stories about

186
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,160
cyber security incidents and breaches

187
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,199
are increasing the size of cyberspace is

188
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,400
increasing at a much faster pace and

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
unless we take into account the size of

190
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
cyberspace it doesn't really reflect the

191
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,160
actual

192
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,039
actual threat posed by cyber attacks

193
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,319
and this is certainly validated by uh

194
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
the investments in cyber security

195
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,440
technologies

196
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,800
uh across

197
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
across all sectors so uh in 2004 the

198
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
size of the cyber security market was

199
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
3.5 billion as i said in the beginning

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,759
of the talk uh in 2017 it was 120

201
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
billion in 2025 is supposed to exceed 1

202
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,599
trillion so the cumulative average

203
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,440
growth rate of the cyber security market

204
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,039
is actually 20

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,800
uh whereas the typical sort of s p 500

206
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,360
growth rate for for

207
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,520
the overall market is typically around

208
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,919
seven percent so in fact the cyber

209
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,440
security market is over performing uh

210
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,360
by the

211
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,520
by the overall market

212
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,039
by by almost

213
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,360
three times

214
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,000
and these investments uh in these

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,160
financial investments in cyber security

216
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,720
technologies are being driven by market

217
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,280
incentives to to invest in security and

218
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
the first of these incentives is the

219
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,199
need to protect proprietary information

220
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,759
so in 2002 professor gene camp from

221
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,319
indiana wrote a paper that

222
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,599
media companies would be incentivized to

223
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,319
invest in security to protect content

224
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,240
and you can extend that argument to say

225
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,479
that any company would be incentivized

226
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,719
to invest in security to protect

227
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
intellectual property

228
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
now additionally in

229
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,320
addition to protecting intellectual

230
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,419
property uh

231
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,479
[Music]

232
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
you your company might have customers

233
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,920
with specific

234
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
security requirements because those

235
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
customers in turn want to protect their

236
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,720
intellectual properties uh so if you're

237
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,240
a vendor for a company you would be

238
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,320
incentivized to invest in security to

239
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
satisfy those security requirements

240
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,839
you'd be

241
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
incentivized even more if those

242
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,160
customers can easily switch to a

243
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,680
different vendor

244
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
especially if you had if you had a

245
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,519
security incident

246
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,399
so

247
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,360
you know with

248
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,279
things like software defined networking

249
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
and network function function

250
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,519
virtualization switching costs have

251
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,680
decreased in a lot of different domains

252
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
and in those domains

253
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,000
vendors would have an added incentive to

254
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,839
invest in security because then that

255
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
creates a stickiness for their

256
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,320
particular product

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,880
additionally if you know if if you are

258
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,160
someone who creates products that are

259
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,000
integrated so

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,360
the

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
negative security impacts from one

262
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
product are internalized by a

263
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
complimentary product then again you

264
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
would be incentivized to build a more

265
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,320
secure product

266
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
one example of this can be isps who also

267
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,880
provide gateways and routers to their

268
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
customers if they don't build security

269
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,279
into those gateways and routers well

270
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,560
then they'll have to deal with the

271
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,680
negative consequences of having

272
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,279
potentially malicious traffic on their

273
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,560
network and so again they're

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
incentivized to build security into

275
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
those gateway survivors by default

276
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
now certain certain companies and

277
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,720
certain vendors might actually want to

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,880
differentiate themselves in security

279
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,360
there's certainly a lot of research

280
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,880
that has made the argument that

281
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
a lot of customers are willing to pay a

282
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,800
premium for security and that there's a

283
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,519
big market of those customers

284
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
now certain companies and we we have

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,120
seen

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,640
this in the market

287
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
they brand themselves on security and

288
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
they differentiate their products and

289
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,000
security and those companies would

290
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,839
suddenly be incentivized to invest in

291
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,640
cyber security now even if you are not

292
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,240
one of those companies

293
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
if you

294
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,920
experience a security incident it can

295
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
have reputational consequences on your

296
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,920
annual

297
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,720
and rate of return your stock price it

298
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,279
can create additional costs like hiring

299
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,959
you might you know after after a

300
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,640
security incident you might have to hire

301
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
additional security professionals or it

302
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
can have an impact on productivity

303
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,519
and

304
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,959
the the

305
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,640
and certainly on stock price and the

306
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,279
impact on stock price is not necessarily

307
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,240
limited to the firm that gets victimized

308
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,440
there's some research that shows that

309
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,279
when a firm gets victimized it doesn't

310
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,880
just impact the stock price of that

311
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,440
particular firm but it also has a

312
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,839
negative impact on other firms in the

313
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,240
same industry protocol so what that does

314
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,279
is it creates an incentive for firms

315
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,120
within the same sector

316
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,600
to collaborate to solve security

317
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,079
problems that require efforts

318
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,279
by firms across the sector

319
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,079
and

320
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,440
we

321
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,279
we have case studies of how these

322
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,320
incentives have driven uh adoption

323
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
of secure technologies as well as

324
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,720
investments in security uh so the first

325
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,240
example is the adoption of ssh

326
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,279
so prior to ssh the the protocol we used

327
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,480
was telnet the telnet your username and

328
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,959
password was sent in the clear so anyone

329
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,040
who is listening into the network could

330
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,120
basically steal your username and

331
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,360
password and use it to well steal

332
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
service from your account so if you're a

333
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,920
system owner who was using that service

334
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,600
you would be incentivized to create a

335
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,160
ssh client rather than internal client

336
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
because you're trying to make sure that

337
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,519
well you're trying to prevent the theft

338
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,800
of service

339
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,959
at the same time if you were a system

340
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,800
administrator who was providing that

341
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,760
service

342
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,480
you would be worried about people

343
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,040
using a compromise account to have a

344
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,120
broader impact on the ecosystem either

345
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,360
through

346
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,880
[Music]

347
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,639
escalation of privileges or through lag

348
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,560
world movement so you would be

349
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
incentivized to provide ssh servers

350
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,720
rather than telling servers

351
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,600
so that double-sided dynamic where both

352
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
the customer and the provider has an

353
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
incentive to

354
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,800
to adopt the most secure technology

355
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,680
led to the adoption of ssh

356
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
now

357
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
these kinds of incentives don't have to

358
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
just change behaviors within a

359
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,920
particular network

360
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,200
you can have

361
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,079
these incentives type security behaviors

362
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,480
across different networks as well so for

363
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,720
example the anti-botnet code for

364
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
internet service providers is a

365
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,040
voluntary code of conduct that has been

366
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,959
adopted by a lot of isps in the united

367
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,920
states

368
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,639
and

369
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,360
the reason why this sort of intra sector

370
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,320
effort or in within sector effort has

371
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
taken place

372
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
again is because uh having malicious

373
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
traffic on one particular isps network

374
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,560
also has impact on another isp

375
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,720
so a lot of isps for example as part of

376
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,800
this anti-partner code have decided to

377
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,720
filter traffic from

378
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,199
spoofed ips which was one of the ways

379
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,560
that people used to conduct ddos attacks

380
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
and then finally

381
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
these incentives can also lead to

382
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
cross-sector collaboration so the c2

383
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,240
consensus

384
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
is basically a cross-sector

385
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
collaboration between multiple trade

386
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,399
groups who came together to agree that

387
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,160
there must be at least 10 device

388
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
capabilities that should be considered

389
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,680
baseline

390
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,720
to provide security for all iot devices

391
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,360
and again the the driver here is that if

392
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,920
you have a vendor who is providing who's

393
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,880
building

394
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,839
or selling insecure iot devices that

395
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,600
doesn't just have a business cost to

396
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
that particular vendor but also has a

397
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,519
business cost but the rest of the

398
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,639
ecosystem

399
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,760
so

400
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,320
one example that comes to mind is that

401
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,000
there was a hotel in europe that was

402
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
using smart blocks and those blocks had

403
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,199
a security breach and the hotel guests

404
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,440
were not able to enter into their rooms

405
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,920
so the hotel went back to using physical

406
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,560
keys rather than smart blocks

407
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,920
so not only

408
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
that that

409
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,639
was their cost of business for the

410
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,079
vendor who sold those insecure uh

411
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,639
internet connected blocks but it also

412
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,800
potentially prevented other hotels in

413
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,320
the same area

414
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,519
from switching to smart locks and then

415
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
the the particular victim in this case

416
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
in fact went back to physical locks and

417
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,959
so again they they did not choose a

418
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,000
different smart lock provider

419
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,959
so

420
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,040
why should all this matter well uh

421
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,560
the the idea here is that you have

422
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,920
all these uh

423
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,160
arguments about how

424
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,519
you know we may not have enough

425
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,839
incentive to invest in security yeah

426
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,120
that they're not enough market

427
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,360
incentives to invest in security but at

428
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,440
the same time we are seeing significant

429
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,360
investments in security across the board

430
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
there's there's a massive growth

431
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,560
in

432
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,920
investment in cyber security

433
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,360
technologies

434
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,199
and it is being driven by market

435
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,680
incentives to invest in security so the

436
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,519
question you know we should

437
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,920
ask is not whether or not companies have

438
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
an incentive to invest in security but

439
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,480
what we should ask is what kind of

440
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,519
companies or what kind of sectors uh do

441
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,079
these incentives either don't have

442
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,920
adequate impact or maybe uh are not uh

443
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
are not present

444
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,839
and to the extent that they're not

445
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
present as we are building cyber

446
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
security policy

447
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,560
we need to make sure that it's not a

448
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,759
one-size-fits-all solution because there

449
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,680
are sectors and there are industries

450
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
where there are plenty of strong market

451
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
incentives to invest in security and

452
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
perhaps those sectors

453
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,199
do not need

454
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,000
should

455
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
should not have the same kind of cyber

456
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
cyber policy solution as sectors where

457
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,600
those incentives are either not as

458
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,839
impactful or maybe are not present

459
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,680
whatsoever

460
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,399
so that is all for me i i do have a

461
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,680
paper

462
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,360
that has more details on all the

463
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,839
arguments that i made that is available

464
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,839
online on ssrn

465
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,839
you can also

466
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,360
search for

467
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,519
the paper title covenants without the

468
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,519
sort market incentives for security

469
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,359
investments and that should bring that

470
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,559
up

471
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,400
so i'll end my talk here if there are

472
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
any questions i'm happy to answer them

473
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,880
thank you

474
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,559
you
