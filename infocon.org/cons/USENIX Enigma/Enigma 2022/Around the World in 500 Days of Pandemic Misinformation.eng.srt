00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,400
hi everybody as kate said i'm patrick

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,000
gage kelly a researcher with google's

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,840
trust and safety

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,880
this is a photograph of a 5g tower that

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,920
was lit on fire in april of 2020.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,199
these are the cables coming out of

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,480
another

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,240
this is a third

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,080
this is the fourth

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,760
there are at least 100 documented

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,279
attacks on 5g towers in the united

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,519
kingdom the netherlands new zealand and

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,040
canada over the past two years

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,880
these are attacks on cell phone

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,879
infrastructure something most of us

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,879
would generally spend zero time thinking

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,760
about

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,360
largely motivated by a range of

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
misinformation

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,719
information that's been widely spread

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,039
including the idea that 5g radiation

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,960
causes covid19

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,920
and 5g signals weaken the immune system

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,879
allowing the spread of covet 19.

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,320
there are other theories unrelated to

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
coven 19 including 5g causing cancer 5g

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
being advanced surveillance or weapons

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,960
technology or 5g signals killing birds

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,159
but birds aren't real anyway

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,400
later 5g would resurface in a set of

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
vaccine-related stories around the ideas

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
of microchips in the vaccine which

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,240
became something of an internet joke

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
uh like this example with ryan reynolds

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,720
here on instagram receiving the vaccine

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,280
with the caption finally got 5g

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
this post as of today has 3.8 million

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,880
likes

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
and over 27 000 comments which i cannot

40
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,600
recommend generally that you read

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,560
but back in april of 2020 in new york

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,119
times reporting on these very real burnt

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,439
out 5g towers

44
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,840
adam santorino and davey alba write the

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
10 most popular 5g chronovirus

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,320
conspiracy videos posted in march were

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,799
viewed over 5.8 million times

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
today the conspiracy can be found on

49
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,280
facebook in over 30 countries including

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,360
switzerland uruguay and japan

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,560
which points to a potentially

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,880
hopefully unique moment

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,959
the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,080
our world

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,879
our personal interactions shaking hands

56
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,640
traveling to see loved ones

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,000
to the masks that we're all wearing in

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
this room

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
to societal level expectations around

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
public health the economy who's an

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
essential worker and who around the

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
globe has access to vaccines

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
this unique moment also means that much

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,319
of the world's attention

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,760
is focused similarly on a single story

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,519
a moment that has now lasted for almost

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,840
two years

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,879
and so using the tools of public opinion

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,519
polling in partnership with ipsos we can

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,080
start to understand how pervasive

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
these ideas are across multiple

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,519
countries

73
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,680
the results i'll discuss today

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,760
include respondents from 16 countries

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,160
shown on this map with surveys beginning

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,239
in may of 2020 and continuing till today

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,360
we asked two simple questions

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,920
the first was focused on exposure

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
we would ask people about a statement of

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
information

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,239
and they would respond to us and say

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,920
i've heard that many times i've heard

83
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,239
that at least once i haven't heard that

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,040
or i'm not sure if i've heard that

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,640
and we asked a second question focused

86
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
on belief where respondents could tell

87
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
us if they strongly believe a statement

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,319
if they kind of believe it if they're

89
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,280
not sure

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,959
if they don't really believe it or if

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,239
they strongly don't believe that

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,840
statement

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
so for example

94
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,319
a single respondent saw this statement

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,560
5g phone networks use radiation that

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,000
weakens the immune system and makes

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
people more likely to get coronavirus

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,159
and a single respondent might have said

99
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,680
that they've heard that many times or

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,440
that they haven't heard that at all that

101
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,040
they strongly believe it or that they

102
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,000
strongly don't believe that

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,760
if we look at our results from the unity

104
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
kingdom again back in may of 2020

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,599
we see that 28 of respondents there had

106
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,879
heard that

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,760
many times with another 49

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,040
of respondents saying they've heard that

109
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,400
at least once and just 23

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
saying that they weren't sure if they'd

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,040
heard that or they were sure that they

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,319
hadn't

113
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,760
showing just how pervasive this

114
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,720
misinformation had been particularly

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
after the attacks were likely on the

116
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,719
news

117
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,639
across the other countries we have

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
responses from

119
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
only one other had more than 50

120
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
reporting that they had heard this

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,720
information that's italy while the other

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
12 had far less the lowest japan

123
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
reported only about 21 exposure to the

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,800
idea that 5g weakens the immune system

125
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,440
and we see these country differences are

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,280
extremely important and they're changing

127
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,520
and this gives us some insight into how

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
we should respond to this information

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,680
but although last may the uk had

130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,479
widespread exposure to the purported

131
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,199
immune weakening radiation of 5g towers

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,120
there was not widespread belief that

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,919
this statement was true and that's good

134
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,400
at the time about 75 percent of uk-based

135
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,240
respondents said they didn't really or

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
didn't strongly believe that this

137
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,080
statement was true or that they weren't

138
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,840
sure with only about 10 believing

139
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
three of those percent strongly

140
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
believing

141
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,960
in some ways this is also good

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,199
the vast majority do not believe that

143
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,280
they are being weakened by 5g towers

144
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,320
that are around them in their

145
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,600
environment

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
but 10 with some belief is still

147
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,960
significant

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,360
10 of respondents is not just noise it's

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
not just limitations with surveys

150
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,680
we're seeing real views here

151
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,199
and at the time the uk was actually a

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,440
bit better off than some other countries

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
14 of australian respondents 13 of

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
canadian respondents 19 in france 19 in

155
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
italy with in france and italy both six

156
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,479
percent strongly believing this

157
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,000
so this is one of our first takeaways

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
there's a lot of people who hold these

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,960
beliefs

160
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,600
and in some cases quite strongly

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,639
beliefs that earlier than this pandemic

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,639
wouldn't have really made sense but in

163
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,400
many ways they're building on years of

164
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,359
conspiracy theories

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
now you might say patrick this is old

166
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,880
may of 2020 is ancient history and all

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,479
sense of time has been removed from our

168
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,560
earth since the pandemic started in may

169
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
of 2020 my sourdough starter was still

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
alive rest in peace in may of 2020

171
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
people cared about hydroxychloroquine

172
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,400
and 5g towers and we're way beyond that

173
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,479
we're busy with anti-vax narratives

174
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,560
we're busy with election misinformation

175
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
to which i say yes and we're going to

176
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,440
get there

177
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,639
but i want to walk through some of the

178
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,400
other information statements we tested

179
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,759
because you're right this isn't all

180
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,479
about 5g

181
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,039
so we've seen 5g if we look at uh the

182
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,720
average across all of the countries that

183
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
we've studied we see about 13

184
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,919
belief that's between kind of and

185
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,599
strongly

186
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,199
we also tested this statement

187
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,960
hydroxychloroquine is an effective

188
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,479
treatment for people without serious

189
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,000
chronovirus symptoms

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,120
that had 19 belief

191
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
we asked people if bill gates george

192
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,319
soros or some other powerful person is

193
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,720
behind the coronavirus that had 16

194
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
belief

195
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,639
and we asked people if injecting

196
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
cleaning products or uv light into

197
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,080
people is an effective treatment for

198
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,400
coronavirus that has 11 belief

199
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
but we don't just have one-time numbers

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,840
we've been running these surveys

201
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,319
semi-regularly since may of 2020 every

202
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
few minutes months checking in to see

203
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,960
how things have changed or not changed

204
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,479
and this is still ongoing we'll have

205
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,000
more data coming in over the next few

206
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
months

207
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
and while we continue to ask these

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
questions one of the effects that we

209
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,879
find over and over again

210
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,919
is that

211
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,319
although the narratives move quickly

212
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,479
although you all have potentially not

213
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
been thinking about injecting uv light

214
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,440
or bleach recently

215
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
once these beliefs are established once

216
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,919
these fringe beliefs take hold they're

217
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
difficult to change

218
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,120
a year later in spring 2021 we again

219
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
asked respondents those statements that

220
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
you saw

221
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,199
and we found that that uk group had only

222
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,080
decreased one percent a

223
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,599
non-statistically significant change

224
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,120
which is reflective of what we saw in

225
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
other countries these beliefs had stuck

226
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,720
and this isn't just true for 5g

227
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
when we look across differences from

228
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,360
2020 and 2021 we see relatively little

229
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
change

230
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,039
and worse we actually see one of the

231
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,240
biggest decreases is 5g support

232
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
that decreased only 2 percent

233
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,200
hydroxychloroquine as an effective

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
treatment was unchanged

235
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
the idea that bill gates george soros or

236
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
someone else was behind chronovirus

237
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,560
actually increased one percent year over

238
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
year

239
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
and injecting cleaning products or uv

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
light

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
didn't change as well

242
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
these views once they are established

243
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,399
stick

244
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
which brings us to vaccines

245
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,000
even before vaccines were available

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,839
it was much discussed in information

247
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,279
quality circles the vaccine

248
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,959
misinformation would be coming and it

249
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,080
would be big

250
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,320
again building on multiple decades of

251
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
anti-vaccination community organizing

252
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,760
we tested multiple items on coronavirus

253
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,040
vaccinations including the coronavirus

254
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
vaccine has microchips in it to secretly

255
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
track those who get vaccinated

256
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,399
which is currently at eleven percent it

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,000
decreased just one percent year over

258
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
year

259
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,680
the chronovirus vaccine may cause

260
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,519
infertility so people who might want to

261
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,640
have children in the future shouldn't

262
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,760
get it

263
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,360
that increased two percent since we

264
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,160
first tested it

265
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,320
and when a coronavirus vaccine is

266
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,240
available it will likely harm many of

267
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,720
the people who get it

268
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,399
that increased five percent from when we

269
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,240
first tested it up to 25 last summer

270
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,839
that means that across a time where

271
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,519
millions of people first safely received

272
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,040
the vaccine we saw increasing mistrust

273
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,640
in vaccines that might harm people

274
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
and again we see relatively little

275
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,959
change here in these numbers

276
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,560
these beliefs tend to stick

277
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,040
while we theme this talk around

278
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,880
measuring and understanding covid

279
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
related misinformation it's important to

280
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
point out that not all misinformation is

281
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,320
created equally

282
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
you'll get a better sense of that in

283
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,360
gus's talk next you heard a bit about

284
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,640
this from chris in terms of

285
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
disinformation

286
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
i'm not going to

287
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,040
get into here ideas of disinformation

288
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,120
misinformation the intent and

289
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
qualifications of what

290
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
qualifies this information

291
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,519
we've seen information shift throughout

292
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,200
the pandemic one of the reasons this is

293
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
difficult is because this information is

294
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,399
changing throughout the landscape

295
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,440
when we first asked about

296
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,519
hydroxychloroquine it was arguably still

297
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,560
up in the air

298
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
that is there were ongoing trials and

299
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,320
while things were starting to maybe not

300
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,600
look great

301
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,399
it wasn't deeply down that very

302
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
polarized confused path that it would

303
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,440
then follow

304
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
one that say ivermectin convalescent

305
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
plasma rem to severe monoclonal

306
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,800
antibodies and others would later follow

307
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
and so from the beginning we included

308
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
statements that were not purely

309
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,160
misinformation not just conspiracy

310
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
theories

311
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
for example we asked participants if

312
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,279
they had heard or believed that a

313
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,200
coronavirus vaccine supported by

314
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
scientists and medical doctors around

315
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,440
the world would be safe

316
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
we first tested this question in october

317
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,760
of 2020 before vaccines were available

318
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,600
before phase 3 results had come back

319
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,760
from any of the major companies

320
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
and at the time only 52 percent of

321
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
respondents believed this

322
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
believed that a vaccine supported by

323
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,320
scientists and medical doctors would be

324
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
safe

325
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
that went up four percent year over year

326
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,839
to where it was sitting last

327
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,079
summer you may find 56 percent to still

328
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,320
be quite low for a vaccine that the

329
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,440
medical community supports

330
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
we also tested some general health

331
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
information and where we want a piece of

332
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
optimism perhaps this is where we should

333
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,440
focus

334
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,279
overall we see much higher rates of

335
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,279
belief than any of the more clear-cut

336
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,959
misinformation or questionable

337
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,519
information statements that we tested

338
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,279
wearing a cloth face covering our mask

339
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,200
in public is an effective way in slowing

340
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
the spread of the coronavirus

341
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,639
and staying at least six feet from

342
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,079
people not in your household is

343
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,360
effective in slowing the spread of the

344
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
chronovirus are two of the questions we

345
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,959
tested

346
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,839
in mid 2020 we saw these numbers at 73

347
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,600
percent and 70 percent

348
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,839
strong belief strong support across the

349
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
16 countries we tested these things in

350
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,680
this is great two of the highest

351
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,959
agreements item we tested

352
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,959
however these were also two of the items

353
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,959
where we saw the largest drop

354
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,639
between 2020 and 2021 5 and 7

355
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,160
respectively

356
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,160
and while this keeps both in the 60

357
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
agreement range

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
it shows how much effort is required to

359
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,880
maintain these extremely high levels of

360
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,360
belief we take this to show how

361
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,160
important continued unified proactive

362
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,120
health messaging is

363
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,399
and we see this in specific countries if

364
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,920
we look at just numbers in the united

365
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
states between may of 2020 and may of

366
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,360
2021

367
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,760
these items both drop by eight percent

368
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,959
likely capturing some of the

369
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,480
polarization that happened over the

370
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,320
course of this year a change in

371
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,920
leadership and a change in messaging

372
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,600
we see different in-country effects for

373
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,680
these items in china belief that social

374
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
distancing was effective which started

375
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
around 71 percent dropped over 15

376
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,040
percent

377
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,639
this likely has much more to do with

378
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,440
china's radically different approach to

379
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,199
covid policy

380
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
dealing with how they support

381
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,839
lockdowns extremely strict lockdowns

382
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,160
overtesting and vaccine requirements

383
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,560
it's one it's another point here to

384
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,240
reflect on how the in-country

385
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,720
differences really determine how we need

386
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,320
to look at these numbers

387
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
although we had the entire world

388
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,040
similarly focused on this one event

389
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,760
we see that local policy local decisions

390
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,279
the ways this interacts with people's

391
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,199
daily lives impacts how they believe and

392
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,320
how they are exposed to this information

393
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
and while i won't have time to get into

394
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,480
every country's individual results today

395
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,240
this is where i want to pause and point

396
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,079
out that even with the entire world

397
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,399
focused on the same general problem we

398
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,360
see from these numbers that

399
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,920
misinformation isn't simply an overlay

400
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
that affects every country and its

401
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
people in the same way

402
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
from different national and government

403
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,320
responses

404
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,480
to the impacts felt by different regions

405
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,720
the availability of vaccines and other

406
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,959
societal factors these all determine how

407
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
messages are spread heard and believed

408
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
additionally all the standard

409
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
methodological limitations apply these

410
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,600
survey questions were written by a

411
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,440
united states-based research team with

412
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
western educated views

413
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,639
while we worked with our research

414
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,480
partners to translate and localize the

415
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,320
results and we do our best to acquire

416
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
the best panel responses that we can

417
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
there are still difficulties here

418
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,320
and for a more complete description of

419
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,560
these issues see my enigma talk from

420
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,279
last year on multi-year opinion surveys

421
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,040
of privacy attitudes back when my hair

422
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,319
was still pandemic blonde

423
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,720
while we're focusing on the limits of

424
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
this work we've also focused just on two

425
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,880
metrics exposure and belief

426
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,399
but what's the relationship between

427
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,079
these two

428
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,240
if we think of one's belief in a piece

429
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
of low quality or potentially

430
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
misinformation an obvious one perhaps

431
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,839
say that powerful people like bill gates

432
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,600
and george soros or some other powerful

433
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,680
person is behind the coronavirus how

434
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,079
does your self-reported exposure

435
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,000
relate to your self-reported belief in

436
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
this item

437
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,920
if we take the group of people who

438
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,600
reported that they weren't sure if they

439
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
had heard this or they aren't sure as

440
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,320
our baseline as our 1x baseline

441
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,839
then if you self-report that you've

442
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,120
heard this many times you're 7.9 times

443
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,040
more likely to believe this is true

444
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
that is a member of the group who

445
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,399
self-reports that they've heard this

446
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,959
many times is 7.9 times more likely to

447
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,480
believe that bill gates george soros or

448
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,160
some other powerful person is behind

449
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
coronavirus than a member of the group

450
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
who reported that they are not sure if

451
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,440
they've heard this or that they haven't

452
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,839
heard

453
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,480
it this isn't just for this example

454
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,040
we see that the belief increases 6.2

455
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,519
times for 5g signal 6.3 times for

456
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,240
general vaccines being harmful 7.2 times

457
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,839
for bleach or uv light as an effective

458
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,800
treatment and 11.7 times more likely to

459
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,240
believe that kovid was created as a

460
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
bioweapon

461
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,040
if you're someone who says you've heard

462
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,839
this many times

463
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,480
overall these odds ratios tell a story

464
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,880
that self-reported multiple exposures

465
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,199
has a relationship with belief

466
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,199
but this data alone again can't tell the

467
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,199
whole story we don't have enough

468
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,279
information from this survey

469
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,240
to explain anything causally that is i

470
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,160
can't say that just being exposed to

471
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,000
this information multiple times will

472
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
lead to belief possibly belief forms and

473
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,559
then people go read more and more about

474
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
some of these theories we also don't

475
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
know where and how these exposures

476
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,119
happen

477
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,160
people have

478
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
potentially self-selected into groups

479
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,599
where this information could be shared

480
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,480
regularly

481
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
and the choices that led to this may

482
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,480
also lead to their beliefs

483
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,319
in this survey we don't know if our

484
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,760
respondents were proactively trying to

485
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
find this information we don't know what

486
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,360
news sources or

487
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,440
real-life conversations or other events

488
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
brought them here

489
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,880
and also while we aren't capturing this

490
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
survey what these beliefs led to in

491
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
terms of real world outcomes in many

492
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,039
ways for example we don't know which of

493
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,760
our respondents actually set fire to 5g

494
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,240
towers though likely none of them

495
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,320
one real world outcome we do have from

496
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,559
the survey again self-reported is who

497
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,880
got vaccinated in the later waves of our

498
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,799
data when vaccination was becoming more

499
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,880
available we see that participants who

500
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,640
believe that vaccines are generally

501
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,320
unsafe are half as likely to get

502
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,559
vaccinated and participants who believe

503
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,480
that when scientists and doctors that a

504
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,400
vaccine it will be safe are about twice

505
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,640
as likely to get vaccinated

506
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,799
this isn't surprising that vaccine

507
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,760
beliefs would lead to vaccine action

508
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
but we're really trying to say that

509
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,240
these beliefs this exposure does have

510
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,559
meaningful real world outcomes it's not

511
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,880
just about cell phone infrastructure it

512
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,720
really is about public health

513
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
so to conclude i want to again highlight

514
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,240
a few of the things we've learned from

515
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
surveying respondents in 16 countries

516
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
over the last two years

517
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
we see substantial populations in every

518
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,600
country believing in various

519
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,960
misinformation and low quality

520
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,720
information statements as well as

521
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,600
widespread exposure to that information

522
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
the reason why we continue to do this

523
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,919
broad public opinion polling work is

524
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,000
it's one way to better understand and

525
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,400
measure misinformation it's one signal

526
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,080
out of many and it highlights

527
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
differences between countries that

528
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,799
continue to deserve further

529
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,720
investigation

530
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,360
we also see that fringe beliefs

531
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,640
sometimes strongly held

532
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,080
mean that

533
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
you know we need to take

534
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,039
these types of beliefs in coordination

535
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,480
with other things that we're thinking

536
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
about non-pandemic topics there are many

537
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,919
beliefs that are held by these

538
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,400
minorities sometimes strongly and this

539
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,760
is something we need to deal with as a

540
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,600
security and privacy community it's

541
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,559
something we need to deal with as a

542
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,240
broader society

543
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,000
because once these beliefs take root

544
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,440
they stick

545
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,760
and so understanding how to stop this in

546
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,520
the first place pre-bunking as was

547
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
mentioned earlier or other ways of

548
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,360
limiting the spread of this exposure and

549
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,559
this belief

550
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,240
may help us

551
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,919
we see things that have long since left

552
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,600
the new cycle still holding similar

553
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
levels of belief to surveys from over a

554
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,240
year ago

555
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
and as always we see just really slow

556
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,720
change in these numbers

557
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,160
and finally we see a relationship

558
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
between exposure and belief and while

559
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,799
this survey can't explain causality

560
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,799
we do see that people who report seeing

561
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,039
misinformation more often also report

562
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,320
higher levels of belief in that

563
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,159
misinformation

564
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,919
we think it's vitally important to

565
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,280
understand the quality of information

566
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,520
that exists on and offline and how that

567
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,039
information leads to beliefs and

568
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,120
behavior in this case behaviors that

569
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
could support or harm public health and

570
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
we're continuing to monitor these items

571
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
as the pandemic continues

572
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
thank you all so much i'd love to take

573
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,440
questions
