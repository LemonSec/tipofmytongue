00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,840
good day everyone thank you antonella

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,320
for the wonderful introduction today i

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,240
am going to discuss about how to

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,920
understand and leverage the human

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,320
factors to stop dangerous iot or

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,640
internet of things devices

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,359
hello my name is dr shanshari dash and

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,439
i'm an assistant professor of computer

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,920
science at the university of denver my

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,199
work focuses on privacy security

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,440
accessibility and the human computer

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
interaction domain at large

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
primarily i work into hacking the human

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
minds so as to create more usable

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,920
privacy preserving secure and accessible

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,399
technology for all so that we can

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,280
enhance the experience of users but in a

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,920
secure way over the internet

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
today i will be discussing about a work

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
which has been done along with my

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
collaborators dr shaktidhar gopavaram

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,079
who is a graduate from indiana

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,760
university bloomington and currently

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,280
works at indeed.com and my advisor dr

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
jean camp who is a professor at indiana

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,640
university bloomington

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
when we talk about iot devices or

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,320
internet of things these are

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,960
traditionally non-standard computing

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
devices that connect wirelessly to an to

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
the internet and have the ability to

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,720
transmit data such as the many devices

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
on the internet of things

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,880
iot involves extending internet

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,439
connectivity beyond standard devices

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,400
such as desktops laptops smartphones and

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,159
tablets to any range of traditionally

38
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:41,520
non-internet-enabled physical devices

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
and everyday objects

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
embedded with technology these devices

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,680
can communicate and interact over the

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
internet

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,439
they can also be remotely monitored and

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,640
controlled and that can be concerning

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,719
now connected devices are part of an

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,159
ecosystem in which every device talks to

47
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,119
other related devices in an environment

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,719
to automate home and industry tasks

49
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,160
they can communicate usable sensor data

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,879
to users businesses and other intended

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,840
parties the devices can be categorized

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
into consumer enterprise as well as

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
industrial

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,760
now consumer connected device includes

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,800
smart tvs smart speakers toys wearable

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,720
smart appliances

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,360
in a smart home for example devices are

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
designed to sense and respond to a

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,680
person's presence when a person arrives

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,519
home their car communicates with the

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
garage to open the door once inside the

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,640
thermostat is already adjusted to their

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
preferred temperature and the lighting

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,200
is set to lower intensity and color as

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
their smart watch data indicates it has

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,959
been a very stressful day other smart

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,599
home devices include sprinkles that

68
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,760
adjust the amount of water given to the

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
lawn based on the weather forecast and

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,239
robotic vacuum cleaners that learn which

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,319
areas of the home must be cleaned more

72
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,159
often

73
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,080
this shows that the impact of iot is

74
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
increasing with every day

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
in fact enterprise iot developments by

76
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,159
the end of 2020 we will see

77
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,959
5.5 billion connections which will rise

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,440
up to about 12 billion by 2024.

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,159
now talking about industrial iot which

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,920
is very closely related to the

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,959
enterprise iot it is expected to reach

82
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,440
nearly 950 billion by 2025

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,680
and this is not adjusted based on the

84
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,239
kovitz situation where we went through a

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,200
digital evolution as i say

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
as i mentioned earlier these devices are

87
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,280
connected over the internet

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
so what can be the issues particularly

89
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
from a privacy and security researcher

90
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
perspective the question comes is there

91
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
at all any privacy

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,280
if this device knows what i'm doing what

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,080
i'm feeling how i'm feeling what is

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,439
what am i

95
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,120
the question comes is privacy dead

96
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,159
along those lines consumers are becoming

97
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
increasingly aware of the privacy and

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,959
security risks associated with iot

99
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,680
devices through media reports opinions

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,918
shared by friends and by observing

101
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,639
unexpected device behavior

102
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,199
though we might say that privacy is dead

103
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,919
people are getting more concern it is

104
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,400
not the same what it was five years back

105
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,199
people want answers to the question

106
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,160
however consumer awareness alone is not

107
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
sufficient to protect individual privacy

108
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
more fundamental behavior responses must

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,280
also be addressed if privacy ought to be

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
protected

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
now when we come to this

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
question the question comes what is

113
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,360
privacy worth what is privacy at all

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
now there are several definitions about

115
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
what privacy is

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
some say it is the right to be let alone

117
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
there are other various technical

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
definitions of privacy as well

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,759
but what is privacy worth well that

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,840
depends on if we are asking an

121
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
individual to how much they are willing

122
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,720
to pay to protect their privacy or if we

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
are asking them how much they are

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,240
willing to accept for losing their

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,600
privacy

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,919
now if people are strictly rational

127
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,960
people would value privacy the same in

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,800
both the scenarios

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,600
however past research has shown that

130
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
people attribute a higher value to

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
privacy in the willingness to accept

132
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
condition where compared to willingness

133
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,479
to pay condition

134
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,320
researchers have previously studied the

135
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
differences to privacy in willingness to

136
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
pay and willingness to accept by

137
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,840
explicitly asking participants to either

138
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,160
pay for privacy or accept payment in

139
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,479
exchange for giving up their privacy

140
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,880
in those studies the participants in the

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,120
willingness to accept condition often

142
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
attributed a higher value for their

143
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,280
privacy

144
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,400
beyond privacy these disparities

145
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,039
have been found to be consistent across

146
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,840
wide varieties of goods such as

147
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,720
movie tickets nuclear waste repositories

148
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,120
and many others

149
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
along those lines we wanted to

150
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,479
understand

151
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
what is the endowment effect here which

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
refers to an emotional bias that causes

153
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,400
individuals to value an owned object

154
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,639
higher often irrationally than its

155
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,160
market value

156
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
the discrepancy between willingness to

157
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
pay and willingness to accept can be

158
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
explained one by the endowment effect

159
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,720
and the status quo biases

160
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,120
i will discuss about these details in a

161
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
few seconds here

162
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,479
past research also suggests that

163
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,199
students tend to have lower willingness

164
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,639
to accept and willingness to pay ratio

165
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,039
that the gen than the general public so

166
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,560
conducting the experiment with the

167
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,840
general population would increase this

168
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,680
ratio across decades of empirical

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
studies a general finding in this is

170
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
that a gain may be moderately valuable

171
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,400
but a loss could be irreplaceable and

172
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
the difference between willingness to

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
accept and willingness to pay would then

174
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,199
be very large

175
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
so we wanted to understand what are

176
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,560
these effects

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
so when we talk about the endowment

178
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,199
effect it states that people attribute a

179
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,840
higher rate to items they possess when

180
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,639
compared to the items they don't

181
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,880
and status score bias consist of two

182
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
components one loss aversions and the

183
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,240
second is omission bias the theory

184
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,639
states that people are inherently loss

185
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,800
averse and so would attribute a

186
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
significantly higher weight to the

187
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,520
losses associated with a change in state

188
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,000
when compared to gains even if they are

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,960
equivalent people are likely to avoid

190
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
however any regret caused by potential

191
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,440
negative outcomes associated with the

192
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
change in state so they avoid taking any

193
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,000
action that would cause a change in the

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,919
state this is called the omission bias

195
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,240
so to understand this we have to

196
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,720
understand how user research works

197
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,639
so we wanted to understand whether

198
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
people actually value their privacy and

199
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,560
for that we need indicators

200
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,840
so for our study the choice of icons and

201
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,560
framing was significantly given to the

202
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,960
users which clearly indicated the

203
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,120
difference between less privacy and more

204
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,679
privacy this was again developed through

205
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,279
prior research

206
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,080
in that in the study

207
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
from prior research the authors compared

208
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,519
stars logs eye signs to indicate what

209
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
exactly conveys privacy using both

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,880
positive and negative framing conditions

211
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,720
the result of the previous study

212
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,040
evaluation on the efficacy of multiple

213
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
framing mechanisms

214
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
and icons was that positively framed

215
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
risk information presented on a

216
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,839
five-point scale using the batlock icon

217
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,399
was most effective therefore here we use

218
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,720
the padlock icon and a five-point scale

219
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
to communicate the aggregate privacy

220
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
risk this is the illustration which we

221
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
have used

222
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
now we want to understa i wanted to

223
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,839
understand what about the privacy

224
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,680
ratings

225
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,360
now previous experiments and willingness

226
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
to pay above compared similar products

227
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,880
like web pages and applications in the

228
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
iot domain evaluation of the privacy and

229
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
security provided the devices with the

230
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,080
corresponding applications and services

231
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,040
it itself and active research area

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,959
for consistency between devices and

233
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,600
based on prior work we calculated the

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
risk ratings based on the privacy

235
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,320
policies associated with the devices and

236
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
the corresponding manufacturers

237
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,800
application the generation of aggregate

238
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
privacy ratings based on the device's

239
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,360
privacy policy is not the focus of our

240
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,440
work but we are going to extend that in

241
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,040
the future work

242
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
however since the validity of our work

243
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
is influenced by the generation of

244
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,360
consistent believable ratings

245
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,160
we started the discussion with ratings

246
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
with padlock and how we can inform the

247
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,079
users

248
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,640
the proposed framework uses a hierarchy

249
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,279
of network classifiers to identify

250
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,360
high-level and fine-grained data

251
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,680
collection and usage policy details they

252
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,519
demonstrate the efficacy of this

253
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,360
framework with an application that

254
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
accepts a link to a privacy policy and

255
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,839
then generates appropriate disconnect

256
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,720
icons based on the preset rules

257
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,959
so based on this previous research we

258
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,160
developed the iot marketplace

259
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,399
as mentioned the goal of the study was

260
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,640
to emulate the willingness to pay and

261
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
willingness to accept scenarios without

262
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
explicitly asking the participants about

263
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,920
it in order to do so we built on the

264
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
principles of status quo bias to design

265
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,279
two versions of the iot marketplace for

266
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,279
the willingness to pay version of the

267
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,040
marketplace

268
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
a participant's initial state would be

269
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
high monetary savings and low privacy

270
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,320
participants have the option to move to

271
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
a state with higher privacy by clicking

272
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,480
on the tabs on the left

273
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,720
however this move would mean they would

274
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,680
have to spend more money we hypothesized

275
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
that since people are loss of us they

276
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
would not want to spend more money for

277
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,640
the products that offer better privacy

278
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,720
here we communicated the aggregatory

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,959
settings using the padlock icon as

280
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,000
displayed in the slide

281
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,120
now for the willingness to accept

282
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
version of the marketplace a

283
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
participant's initial state would be

284
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,279
high privacy and low monetary savings

285
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,360
participants have the option to move to

286
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,760
a state with lower privacy by clicking

287
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
on the tabs to the left however this

288
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
move would mean they would have to give

289
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,800
up their privacy once again people are

290
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
lost a verse so they would not want to

291
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,120
give up their privacy to save a few

292
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,600
bucks additionally participants would

293
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,160
want to avoid the regret caused by loss

294
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,360
and privacy

295
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
all devices with a higher privacy rating

296
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,360
were priced higher than those with a

297
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
lower privacy rating so participants had

298
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,160
to pay premium if they wanted to

299
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,639
purchase devices with a higher privacy

300
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
rating in this study we communicate the

301
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
aggregate risk rating using the padlock

302
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,240
icon as mentioned earlier

303
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,200
so as mentioned we had several

304
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
hypotheses one of the most important one

305
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
was more participant using the

306
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,200
willingness to accept versions of the

307
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,399
marketplace will purchase devices with a

308
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,560
higher privacy rating when compared to

309
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
the participants using the willingness

310
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,680
to

311
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
pay version

312
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,639
for that

313
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,959
for this study we recruited participants

314
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,519
primarily in the indiana area which is a

315
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
college town so our data set mostly

316
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
consisted of students

317
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
we recruited participants by stating

318
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,360
that they would receive a free smart

319
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,000
plug this was done to attract people who

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
were interested in owning a smart plug

321
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,160
as this would enable us to observe a

322
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,839
more realistic purchase behavior

323
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,560
we also gave them a 25 amazon gift card

324
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,320
to purchase the smart

325
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,480
plug we were told they could keep the

326
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
device and the amount left on the card

327
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,320
as well

328
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,639
so to test our hypothesis we conducted a

329
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,040
study with 40 participants and two

330
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,959
experimental group the willingness to

331
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,519
pay which will be called wtp group and

332
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,680
willingness to accept which is the wta

333
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,560
group participants in the wta group were

334
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
presented with the wta version of the

335
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,800
marketplace as displayed earlier and

336
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,120
participants in the wtp groups were

337
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
presented with the wpb were wtp version

338
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
of the marketplace once a participant

339
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
was assigned to a group they were

340
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,959
presented with a series of three devices

341
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,560
for the first two categories of the

342
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
devices security cameras and fitness

343
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,560
trackers they were asked to pick a

344
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,639
product that were most likely to

345
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,480
purchase this was done to enable

346
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
participants to familiarize themselves

347
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,040
with the marketplace interplay interface

348
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
for the third category of devices smart

349
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,199
plugs participants were asked to pick

350
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,320
and purchase and prod uh

351
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,639
a product of their choice participants

352
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,720
were redirected to amazon to purchase

353
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
the device they selected after

354
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,079
purchasing the product they were asked

355
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,680
to return to the study to complete a

356
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,199
series of survey questionnaire

357
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
as i mentioned earlier we had 40

358
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,000
participants 20 per group 50 of our

359
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
participants were men and 50 of our

360
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
participants identified themselves as

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,480
women our data sets skewed younger with

362
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
55 percent of our participants being in

363
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
the 18 to 25 year age group and another

364
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
30 percent of the participant being in

365
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,800
the 25 to 35 years age group they did

366
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
not find any significant difference

367
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,880
between the demographics for the gender

368
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,839
we had other uh non-binary options as

369
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,360
well but we did not find any

370
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
participants who identified with that

371
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,839
category

372
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,920
so talking about our results in terms of

373
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,399
privacy rating the bar chart shows that

374
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,160
more participants in the willingness to

375
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,480
accept group purchase products with the

376
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
highest per privacy rating when compared

377
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,279
to the willingness to

378
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,440
willingness to pay growth the bar chart

379
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,279
also shows that more participants in the

380
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
willingness to pay group purchase with

381
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,440
the lowest privacy rating when compared

382
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
to the willingness to accept growth the

383
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,240
box plot shows a clear difference in the

384
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,560
distribution of privacy rating between

385
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,160
the two groups with the wrwta group

386
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,000
having a higher median for privacy

387
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,480
ratings

388
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
to see if the difference in privacy

389
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,399
rating was statistically significant we

390
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,880
conducted a single-tailed wilcoxon rank

391
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,360
some test the results from the test show

392
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
that the difference was in fact

393
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
statistically significant so we can

394
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,959
definitely see the

395
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,680
our results were significant

396
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,600
recall that participants had to pay a

397
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,360
premium to purchase products with a

398
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,320
higher privacy rating here the box plot

399
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
shows the distribution of premium paid

400
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,279
by participants in two groups

401
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,959
the willingness to accept group had a

402
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,279
higher medium for premium when compared

403
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,279
to the willingness to pay group once

404
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,199
again this difference was found to be

405
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,920
statistically significant

406
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
for the other two device categories we

407
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,759
observed similar results except for the

408
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,519
fact that these differences were more

409
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
pronounced that is the effect size was

410
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,680
larger but these results are not part of

411
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,759
our main paper because participants did

412
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,000
not actually purchase the device however

413
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,880
you can find that in that index

414
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,399
so what does it mean

415
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,079
more participants in the willingness to

416
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,920
accept condition purchase devices from

417
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
the highest privacy category when

418
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,560
compared to willingness to

419
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,639
pay group

420
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,480
these results are promising and indicate

421
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,720
that people can either be nudged towards

422
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,040
or away from making privacy preserving

423
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
choices through interface design there's

424
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,839
a significant implication for example if

425
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,079
amazon were to categorize devices based

426
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,160
on their privacy and show people devices

427
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,759
in the highest privacy category by

428
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,680
default a lot more people would be

429
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,000
willing to pay a premium to purchase a

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,240
device with the highest privacy rating

431
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,319
furthermore this would give companies a

432
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,000
monetary incentive to design and

433
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,559
manufacture devices with higher privacy

434
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,918
and security standards

435
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,679
we selected participants who

436
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,599
self-identified as planning to purchase

437
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,000
home iot devices if those with high

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,079
levels of contextual privacy concerns

439
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,640
are therefore self-flex uh be

440
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
self-excluding by their rejection of iot

441
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,799
privacy risk then the difference between

442
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,960
groups will present represent only those

443
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,559
in the current market

444
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,080
previous research has focused on

445
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,840
obtaining either subjects who value

446
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
privacy

447
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,600
or those with representative privacy

448
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
preferences we choose to recruit

449
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
individuals who sort the devices in

450
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,400
order to obtain more ecologically valid

451
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,640
purchase decisions

452
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,559
the results show that beyond the

453
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
communication of risk the interface of

454
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,799
the marketplace can have an impact on

455
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,120
the purchase decisions people make it

456
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,960
also means that the marketplace like

457
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
amazon can incentivize companies to

458
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
produce more privacy preserving products

459
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,160
by changing their interface right now in

460
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,400
the marketplace is low price and no

461
