1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,080
good morning everyone um would you

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,559
believe me if i told you that about 15

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,759
of the internet

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,679
is behind a captcha that can't tell

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,240
automation from a human

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,039
and

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,119
what on earth does that have to do with

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,680
accessibility and security

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,359
the rest of this talk should start to

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,760
answer those questions

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,840
so here's our quick road map i'm going

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,359
to start with some background talk about

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,960
assistive technology

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
some history and what a captcha is

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,840
go into h captcha which is the product

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,320
that is in question here and finish with

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,559
a look at the future

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,440
so

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,879
as you could probably guess from the

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,039
talk title disability and assistive

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,440
technology is going to play a large part

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,960
in this talk

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
so for those of you who aren't already

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,879
familiar with assistive technology let's

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,879
begin by looking at some

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,399
the use of assistive technologies is

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,559
actually really common many of us are

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,440
using an assistive technology right now

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
eyeglasses and contact lenses

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,200
however as useful as those are

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
they're

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,520
not re they don't really have a bearing

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
on how we interact with computers

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
so i want to focus on some things that

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,880
are

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
assistive technologies in the digital

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,159
input and output

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,200
area

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,080
so

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
let's start with this this is a

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,680
refreshable braille display with a

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
built-in keyboard

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
it could be used by someone who is blind

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
or visually impaired instead of or in

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,960
addition to their keyboard and monitor

46
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
so those eight paddles at the top are

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
the braille input as well as that big

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,960
one at the bottom and the white dots

49
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,479
along the bottom are

50
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,840
output where someone would read text

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,079
next up this is a device called a puff

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,399
and sip which is used by someone

53
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,479
typically who is quadriplegic or has no

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,920
fine motor control

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,520
it can be used to replace a keyboard and

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,360
mouse

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,719
and the last example i want to give you

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,000
is actually a piece of software it's

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
called a screen reader it's used by

60
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
people who are print disabled typically

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,240
blind visually impaired or severely

62
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,600
dyslexic

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,318
it outputs on-screen text as speech and

64
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,080
allows users to navigate with just the

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,040
keyboard if they choose to do so

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,400
i want to use it as a little bit of an

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
example of just how much this has to

68
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,239
change how you think about input and

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,440
output

70
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
so what i'm about to play for you is a

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,480
recording of someone using a screen

72
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
reader i'm first going to play it for

73
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,120
you without video as they would hear it

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,239
and then i'll play it for you with the

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,680

92
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,239

all right

111
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,519
those of you who raised your hand

112
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,200
thought you knew what was going on raise

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,560
your hand again if you were right

all right

115
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,920
so i want to emphasize that these

116
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,280
assistive technologies that i've talked

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,120
about are really only a very small

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
selection of those that are available

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,480
and that there are many more options out

120
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,680
there

121
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,120
each of these methods has its own

122
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,200
advantages and disadvantages so for

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
example a screen reader is hard to use

124
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,680
to skim text but keyboard input is fast

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
in contrast a device like a puff and sip

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
may allow someone to skim quickly but

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,479
might be pretty slow to type assistive

128
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,560
technology is really tuned to a

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
disability and to a person so it's as

130
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,280
variable as disability itself which is

131
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
to say extremely

132
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
two people with the same disability may

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
use entirely different assistive

134
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,880
technology because that's just what

135
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,720
works for them

136
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,919
all right

137
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,639
next up for background is captchas

138
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
these are small puzzles that are simple

139
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,080
for humans to solve and hard for

140
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,240
computers this is sometimes called ai

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
hard human easy typically they're used

142
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,560
to ensure that a request comes from a

143
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,039
human and not some kind of automation if

144
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,479
you'll bear with me for a little bit of

145
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639
history the name is from a paper called

146
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,479
captcha using hard ai problems for

147
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,360
security which was published in 2003.

148
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,080
that led directly to recaptcha the first

149
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,160
version of which you see here

150
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
other things were catches first just

151
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
they didn't quite get that name

152
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
recapture was one of the first if not

153
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,400
the first to make captures do useful

154
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
work it got humans to label hard to read

155
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
portions of text in order to train

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,479
optical character recognition systems

157
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,160
so what was brilliant about recapture

158
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
was how it aligned two very diverse

159
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
problems in this case websites and users

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
wanting to eliminate automation on the

161
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,080
internet and the authors of ocr software

162
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
needing better data to train their

163
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,039
software

164
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,039
recaptcha took these two groups and

165
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,400
positioned them to solve each other's

166
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,639
problems

167
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,840
recapture was bought by google who

168
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
wanted better ocr

169
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
eventually machine ocr got to be as good

170
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,639
or better than humans so it's no longer

171
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,400
an ai hard problem

172
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
look around for another ai heart problem

173
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
object identification and photography is

174
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
what they have more recently settled on

175
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
and then recapture was revised once

176
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
again into this now familiar i'm not a

177
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
robot checkbox

178
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,880
this version of recaptcha tracks the

179
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
user's behavior on the page and applies

180
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,319
machine learning to determine if the

181
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,880
user is human or automation

182
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,319
the user's only asked to solve a

183
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,240
challenge or a puzzle if they look like

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,479
they might be automation

185
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,039
and recaptcha isn't the only captcha out

186
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,880
there but it is one of the best known

187
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,319
ones and it has tended to be at the

188
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,600
cutting edge of captures which is why

189
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,560
i've used it for some history

190
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
so that brings us finally to h-captcha

191
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
h-captcha is a commercial product put

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,520
out by a company called intuition

193
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,560
machines

194
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
it's used to prevent automation

195
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
according to their numbers on about 15

196
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
of the internet

197
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,639
mostly this is through their largest

198
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,720
customer cloudflare who picked them up

199
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
in april 2020 which is actually how i

200
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
heard about them

201
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
intuition machines itself is a

202
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
blockchain based data labeling service

203
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,039
company

204
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,720
so if a researcher has a large set of

205
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
pictures of say modes of transport and

206
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,319
wants to have them labeled with what

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
type of transport is in each picture

208
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,759
they can pay in tuition machines to get

209
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
labels attached to each picture

210
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
intuition machines does this by

211
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,599
crowdsourcing it via h-captcha

212
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,400
and

213
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
in turn they turn around and pay website

214
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
owners to run hcaptcha

215
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,680
there's a blockchain in the middle but

216
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,840
that's not particularly germane to this

217
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
talk

218
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,199
so intuition machines and agecapture

219
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,800
claim on their homepage that age capture

220
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
is three things

221
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,479
first private as in they don't track or

222
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,440
sell your data second secure as in it

223
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
keeps out automation and make sure that

224
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,479
the user is human

225
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,120
and third faster and lower friction as

226
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
in it's easy for the users to use

227
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
so what does using h-captcha actually

228
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
look like

229
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
we're going to start by walking through

230
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
their visual timed workflow so you go to

231
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,160
a page you start filling out a form

232
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,440
get to a place where there's a box

233
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
labeled i'm human and you check that

234
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
at this point the age capture software

235
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,720
looks at some criteria and decides if it

236
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,039
believes that you might be automation

237
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,639
these criteria are an intuition

238
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,039
machine's secret but they might be

239
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,879
things like your ip address if age

240
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,240
capture has been able to put cookies in

241
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,960
your browser before and your behavior on

242
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
the page

243
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,800
if you look unusual if you look like

244
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,680
automation you get shown a challenge

245
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
now guess who's the most likely to look

246
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,280
unusual

247
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
users of assistive technology who might

248
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
do things like navigate through one page

249
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
and never move the mouse

250
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,680
my personal experience

251
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
across their site ebay cloudflare and

252
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
even the submission site for this

253
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,919
conference

254
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,679
is that age captcha when you see it

255
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,200
always shows a challenge

256
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
after all age captcha exists to get data

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
labeled so they're pretty heavily

258
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,600
incentivized to show as many challenges

259
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
to as many users as possible

260
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,360
of course it's also possible that

261
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,640
something about me is just inherently

262
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
suspicious

263
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,880
so you check that box it pops a

264
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,480
challenge

265
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,640
select all images that contain a boat go

266
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,720
ahead click them click next

267
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,560
repeat for a new set of images select

268
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,920
all the boats

269
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,160
click verify at the bottom of this one

270
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,720
and finally that pop-up goes away the

271
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
box checks you're certified as human and

272
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,120
on you go

273
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,360
but let's rewind let's say that you

274
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
can't use that visual timed workflow

275
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
perhaps you're blind and can't identify

276
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,480
the images

277
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
or you're quadriplegic and you can't

278
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,080
select the images before the challenge

279
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,200
times out

280
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,399
how do you get through each captures

281
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,600
challenge

282
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,360
you use what they call the accessible

283
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,440
workflow so let's start working through

284
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,160
that starts in the same place the form

285
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,920
check the impune box

286
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
and on you go

287
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
up pop's a challenge

288
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,399
unfortunately

289
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
we just you can't do it if you're lucky

290
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
you don't spend a lot of time trying and

291
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,279
instead you look for accessible options

292
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,880
eventually you might find the burger

293
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,399
menu in the bottom left corner of that

294
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,399
little pop-up and from there an item

295
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,399
that says accessibility so you click on

296
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,360
that

297
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,800
which brings you to a web page where you

298
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,399
can put in your email and sign up for

299
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,000
accessibility access

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
submit that which tells you to check

301
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,399
your email you go to your email you wait

302
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,320
and eventually this shows up

303
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
there's a link that's stylized to look

304
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,320
like a button in there that says get

305
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
accessibility cookie so you click on

306
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
that

307
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
which brings you to a web page that

308
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
looks like this

309
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,640
you click the set cookie button

310
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,079
and a little notification lets you know

311
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,519
that the cookie's set

312
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
by the way last i checked i believe this

313
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,600
notification actually doesn't alert to

314
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
screen readers and other alternative

315
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,320
output

316
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,200
so

317
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
if you use one of those technologies

318
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
you're left wondering if it actually

319
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
worked correctly which given that that's

320
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,120
the por the population that this

321
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
workflow is designed to serve is hell of

322
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
you usability failure

323
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
large part of the intended audience for

324
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,839
this workflow isn't going to get

325
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,440
feedback to know whether or not this

326
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
workflow actually succeeded for them

327
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,839
anyway

328
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,839
you're here the cookie's set

329
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,680
go back to the form you were working on

330
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,440
which is probably timed out so you fill

331
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,240
it in again check the i am human box

332
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,519
and this time it just works all right

333
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,440
this seems like a pretty reasonable

334
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,200
process right at least to cover the

335
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,079
entire gamut of possible assistive

336
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,760
technologies and disabilities that might

337
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,959
have trouble with a visual timed

338
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,560
workflow

339
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
the process is seven or eight steps

340
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
assuming everything works properly

341
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,959
and some of those steps involve waiting

342
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,240
the visual time workflow is three steps

343
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
that's a huge difference especially in

344
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
comparison to other captchas which have

345
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,839
accessible challenges that had no extra

346
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,040
steps and no extra waiting

347
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
however i should also point out that

348
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,839
this is only the first time workflow

349
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,680
doesn't always take so long

350
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
that cookie that got set is good for 24

351
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,760
hours

352
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,880
and you only have to deal with that

353
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
dashboard once a day so once you have

354
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,959
that you can go back to the dashboard

355
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,800
only once a day once you have that email

356
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
from hcaptcha you can always use that to

357
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
get back to the dashboard so the signup

358
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,000
process is skipped and some of the

359
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,079
waiting processes skipped

360
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,519
nonetheless

361
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,959
let's go back to what each capture says

362
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,240
they are

363
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,920
they're definitely not low friction if

364
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
you're a person with a disability

365
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,240
so let's strike out faster lower

366
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
friction and add except for people with

367
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,320
disabilities

368
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,959
now that's one thing but there are two

369
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,800
big problems with how this workflow

370
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
works compared to the visual timed

371
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
workflow

372
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
let's call the first one the privacy

373
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,959
problem

374
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,440
this is a slightly broader screenshot of

375
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,279
their accessibility dashboard where you

376
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,800
sign in with that link that they email

377
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,920
you

378
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,360
up in that upper right hand corner with

379
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
the red circle is the email address or

380
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,959
at least part of it that i used to sign

381
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,360
up for the accessibility workflow

382
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
this has some pretty significant privacy

383
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
implications it means that every cookie

384
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,720
that h-capture hands out via the

385
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
accessibility workflow they can tie back

386
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,079
to a specific email address essentially

387
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,839
to a component of someone's permanent

388
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,279
identity and because hcaption embeds in

389
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,040
many places they can follow that cookie

390
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
and therefore that user

391
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
with most captchas if you don't want to

392
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,079
be tracked like that you can just wipe

393
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,880
the cookies but hcap's accessibility

394
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,160
workflow

395
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,279
you don't have to ever have done

396
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,959
anything by the time you get that cookie

397
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,519
it's already tied to you

398
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,040
it's very important that i point out h

399
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,720
capture says they don't do this in their

400
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
terms and conditions

401
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,000
but there's no independent way to verify

402
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,519
that and it's frightening enough that

403
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,079
they have the technical capability

404
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,200
so

405
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,120
in short in terms of accessibility and

406
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,920
privacy age capture isn't separate but

407
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
equal it's separate and unequal

408
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
so is this really the world we want to

409
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,040
live in one where certain people because

410
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,800
of things that they can't change have to

411
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
forfeit their privacy in order to

412
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,760
participate in parts of society

413
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,120
so let's go back to what each capture

414
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,720
says they are and update that again

415
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
we're going to strike private and add

416
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,240
private except for people with

417
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
disabilities

418
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,800
i

419
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,279
alluded to there being two big problems

420
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,120
so that was privacy now let's deal with

421
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,399
security

422
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,680
i'm actually not the first person to

423
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,040
look at the security of their system

424
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,519
there's a paper that came out a low-cost

425
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,040
attack against the h-capture system

426
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,880
written by huston high

427
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
they used images from h captcha as

428
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,639
training for machine learning

429
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,279
and were able to pass with a 95 success

430
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,320
rate

431
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
h captures had time to work on counter

432
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
measures but i'm not aware of any

433
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,720
re-evaluation being done so back to what

434
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,240
they are we'll put a question mark next

435
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,360
to secure they've had time to work on it

436
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,959
but pop quiz before we get into the

437
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,959
second problem or really deep into the

438
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,720
second problem

439
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,320
when does that accessible workflow

440
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,399
actually verify that the user is human

441
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,600
show of hands

442
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
is it when the user clicks a button

443
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,839
when the user enters their email

444
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,240
when the user opens a link in an email

445
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
or whenever you want just check the

446
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
browser agent

447
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,800
all right you're all very smart because

448
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,920
none of you raised your hands it doesn't

449
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
no part of this accessible workflow is

450
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
an ai hard problem or at all difficult

451
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,000
to automate

452
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,240
and this is a short video of some quick

453
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,160
and dirty automation i put together in

454
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
order to prove that this process can be

455
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,360
automated

456
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,959
you see it typing an email it'll go

457
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,800
through and open the the link set the

458
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
cookie and then check the box and be

459
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,920
certified as human

460
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,240
it's nothing fancy just x do tool

461
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,519
driving the mouse and a little custom

462
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,519
python to run a mail server

463
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,040
and as you'll see in a second it's

464
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,560
perfectly capable of running through the

465
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
entire accessibility workflow without

466
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
any intervention

467
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,560
h captcha has some countermeasures

468
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,639
mostly in the form of rate limiting each

469
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,199
cookie can only be used so many times

470
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
each account only gets so many cookies

471
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,279
per day each ip address can only sign up

472
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,360
for so many accounts per day and each

473
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
domain can only sign up for so many

474
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,720
accounts per day

475
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
but domains are cheap and rotating ip

476
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,759
addresses is easy so it's not clear how

477
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,759
effective these are in the real world

478
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,600
and you can now see that it has checked

479
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
the i am human box in the bottom

480
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,920
left-hand corner there

481
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,959
so

482
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,040
let's go back to what h-captcha is

483
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,199
and we're going to now strike secure and

484
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,040
say accept that it can be automated

485
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,160
so

486
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,680
by now i hope i've convinced you that

487
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,839
each capture's accessibility workflow is

488
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,360
broken

489
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,040
all the work i did on this

490
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
was under their bug bounty program i've

491
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,240
just closed it to them and i've

492
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
disclosed it to cloudflare who run a

493
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,920
second independent instance

494
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,839
both of them said it was not an issue

495
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,680
due to mitigations that they declined to

496
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
disclose or due to the resource usage

497
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,560
required to circumvent the captcha

498
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,079
however this is also a really great time

499
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,680
for me to note that h capture appears to

500
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
have shut down this automated accessible

501
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,279
workflow sometime in the second half of

502
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,839
2021 or early 2022

503
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,839
or at least i haven't been able to do it

504
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,320
since then and they've disabled all old

505
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,680
accounts

506
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,360
it's all still there but when you go to

507
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,680
put in your email it throws out an error

508
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,839
and says you have to email support

509
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,040
you have to wait for a human support

510
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
person to handle your ticket they ask

511
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
for your ip address your browser

512
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,360
identification a user agent string what

513
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,759
website you're on and what about age

514
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,920
captcha doesn't work for you

515
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,759
that last bit is particularly critical

516
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,160
it's not quite asking you to disclose a

517
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,720
disability but it gets real damn close

518
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
saying i can't see the photos isn't the

519
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,199
same thing as saying i'm blind

520
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,799
but you can kind of it has the same

521
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,720
effect

522
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
this decision to use a process where

523
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,559
people have to prove that they somehow

524
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,039
deserve to use the accessible workflow

525
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,880
completely circumvents that captchas are

526
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,959
supposed to be automated tests

527
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,839
and

528
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
even more so than the previous

529
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,079
accessible accessible workflow

530
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,320
impacts the privacy and usability for

531
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,000
any user who has to use that workflow

532
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
so let's take a step back and look at

533
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,080
the bigger picture

534
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,280
let's talk about how such a flawed

535
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,640
design came to be

536
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,320
before i get into that i want to be

537
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
clear this is derived from what they've

538
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,600
written publicly it's my best

539
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
reconstruction i've no private

540
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,799
information i haven't spoken with them

541
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
about the process

542
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,960
hcatcha is a data labeling service so

543
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,720
they need data to label

544
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,480
computers typically put out audio and

545
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
visuals not much for the other senses so

546
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
captures will be either audio or visual

547
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,039
captchas

548
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
most capture services that provide an

549
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,960
accessible alternative do so via audio

550
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
however h capture believes and this is a

551
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,880
direct quote from their support staff

552
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
that quote audio options provide

553
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,840
virtually no security end quote and that

554
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,080
they believe google's recaptcha disables

555
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,760
audio captures if it believes that there

556
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,840
is any chance the traffic is actually

557
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,280
automation

558
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,039
i found no evidence that the last part

559
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,720
is actually the case despite a lot of

560
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,160
questions on the internet asking how to

561
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,120
disable audio captchas

562
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,720
this belief that audio captures are low

563
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,360
security is in my opinion what led h

564
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
captcha to choose to do a visual only

565
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,520
captcha after all it would be high

566
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,919
security right

567
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,679
somewhere along the way someone realized

568
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,360
they need to make this accessible

569
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,039
don't know the mechanism perhaps someone

570
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,559
consulted an attorney who reminded them

571
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,760
they were at risk of being suited

572
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,919
product wasn't accessible to everyone

573
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,280
not just those who currently have good

574
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,440
eyesight and fast reflexes

575
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
to their credit it really does appear

576
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
that they implemented the accessible

577
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,919
workflow at the end of the engineering

578
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,679
process and before launch so when they

579
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,320
launched that workflow was there

580
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,280
however

581
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,400
discovering the accessibility

582
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,679
requirement would have been a good time

583
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
to step back and reconsider their no

584
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,440
audio captchas

585
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,679
instead they came up with this strange

586
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,360
accessible workflow that we walked

587
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,120
through earlier

588
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,960
so what's next for each captcha clearly

589
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,480
this tacked on workflow didn't work

590
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,240
age captcha says they're moving to a new

591
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
text-based challenge system this has

592
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,240
users answer questions like this one

593
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,080
what object can tell time and makes

594
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
determinations based on that

595
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,600
it has language and cultural challenges

596
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
which they acknowledge but if done well

597
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,799
is actually really good for certain

598
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,039
populations with disabilities it's one

599
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,880
of the few if not the only caption

600
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
mechanism that would actually be

601
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,360
accessible to those who are deaf-blind

602
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
but it could be bad for others for

603
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,080
example the cognitively impaired

604
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,360
they've also talked about fixing the

605
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,120
privacy side of this by using a browser

606
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
extension called privacy pass which

607
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,480
gives cryptographically blind tokens for

608
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
capture bypasses

609
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
it already works for the visual timed

610
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,159
workflow but not as far as i can tell

611
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,760
for the accessible one

612
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,960
they've been telling me that this

613
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
capability is coming since april 2020 so

614
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480
i will believe it when i see it

615
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,840
in my opinion though they're kind of

616
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,159
fundamentally stuck unlike other captcha

617
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,480
players their business model reply

618
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,640
excuse me relies on them getting paid to

619
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
label data

620
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,919
that means that they have to show users

621
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,559
data and they have to have a challenge

622
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,799
where users label that data

623
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,679
they know they can't use the

624
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,039
accessibility solution that i have just

625
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,640
talked about so they've shut it down and

626
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,240
yet they haven't gotten this new

627
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
text-based captcha out

628
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
which they announced in march of 2021.

629
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,320
so hcat is stuck what about others

630
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
we're starting to see a decoupling of

631
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,240
this automation detection from these ai

632
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,080
hard problems

633
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,280
and into other methods of

634
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,919
differentiating human from automation so

635
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,600
do we want to continue using these ai

636
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,840
hard human easy problems what do we do

637
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,600
when these are exhausted

638
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,679
are there other more effective ways to

639
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,600
handle automation on the internet and

640
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
how will any future solution interact

641
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,679
with accessibility

642
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,679
so as i wrap up and we all start to head

643
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,960
off towards lunch what do i want you

644
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,240
thinking about

645
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
three things first when doing design

646
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,240
make sure you're considering all of your

647
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,400
users and requirements tacking on

648
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,440
accessibility at the end of the

649
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
engineering process is what caused that

650
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
workflow and those assumptions that they

651
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,000
made just fail so spectacularly

652
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
second be aware of what happens at the

653
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,120
margins

654
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
i talked a lot about ai hard human easy

655
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,799
problems

656
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,720
but for which humans are these problems

657
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,320
actually easy is it all humans

658
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,919
every design decision is a trade-off

659
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,840
even the ones that you think aren't so

660
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,679
for example a fancy searchable drop down

661
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,360
box might be inaccessible to a screen

662
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,480
reader user

663
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,840
so for every decision that you're making

664
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,919
consider who's at the margins and how

665
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,120
that decision is going to affect them

666
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,679
third and last design for a mainstream

667
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,760
that works for everyone when it comes to

668
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,280
accessibility trying to create and

669
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,919
maintain parallel workflows or products

670
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,520
is a truly excellent way to end up

671
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,760
breaking your entire system

672
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
inaccessibility excuse me

673
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,360
inaccessibility

674
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,080
separate is never equal

675
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,460
i'm now happy to take questions
