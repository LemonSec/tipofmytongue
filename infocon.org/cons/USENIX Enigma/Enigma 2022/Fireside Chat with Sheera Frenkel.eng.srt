for taking a few minutes to to join us

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,240
thank you all for having me so this is

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,840
uh there's so many topics we could talk

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
about and uh we only have about 45

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,920
minutes but uh maybe we can start a

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
little bit with the time period that you

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,600
selected for the book there i mean

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
you've been reporting on facebook for a

38
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,040
long time but you kind of zoomed in a

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,080
little bit tell us a little bit about

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,479
that yeah you know we we wrote several

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,000
versions of this book and there was one

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,159
that was twice as long which covered its

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,119
entire history um happily there are many

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,560
books out there on facebook which look

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
at its early days its founding its move

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,439
you know to menlo park and its growth as

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,079
a technological giant and we decided

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,360
that the period of time that we felt

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,720
deserved the most scrutiny because it

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,079
really told us the most about the

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,720
evolution of the company was roughly the

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,119
period between two elections 2016 and

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,399
2020

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,439
because

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,799
i mean the problems that happened in

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
2016 had germinated long before then

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,159
but they really brought to the forefront

58
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,040
how big facebook had gone had gotten and

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,479
um what sort of problems the platform

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,720
had introduced to society and so we

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,000
thought that by looking at this kind of

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
crucial time period of right you know

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
the 2016 elections happen the world

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
finds out there's been russian election

65
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,720
interference

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,879
um and then the immediate aftermath of

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,440
facebook trying to fix itself

68
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
leading through to the presidency of

69
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,800
donald trump the way he challenged the

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
company and made them really re-examine

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
their policies on many things and then

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
the 2020 elections gave us a nice kind

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,879
of bookend of where the company was and

74
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,720
where they hoped to go

75
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,760
interesting and there was uh in one of

76
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,239
the first few pages there was um there

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,160
was a section that caught my eye and i

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,440
actually had to reread it a couple of

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,319
times

80
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,160
uh make sure i fully understood it but

81
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
you you said that

82
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
the uh the whole idea is that this is

83
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
not a classic frankenstein frankenstein

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,599
story where the monster got away

85
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,000
and that what we see today is really the

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,200
result of uh deliberate action so you

87
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
can tell us a little bit more about that

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,599
yeah i i love that idea because it came

89
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,800
from an engineer working at facebook and

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
he noted rightfully that a lot of

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
journalists tended to describe facebook

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
as the frankenstein it had gotten way

93
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,080
out of control it had expanded too

94
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
quickly to

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,519
too far too quickly and that the

96
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,120
problems we now saw whether they were in

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,959
myanmar or in the united states was the

98
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,280
result of that rapid growth and this

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,519
engineer who still works at facebook

100
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,799
actually was saying it's not

101
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,280
frankenstein it's working exactly as it

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,680
was designed to work it's intentional

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,319
this company was designed to get people

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,440
you know to share as much about

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,720
themselves as possible all that

106
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
information is data we work based on

107
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
data we optimize based on data that's

108
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,519
what lets us sell ads and so we designed

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,840
this to be a really addictive platform

110
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,280
where you spend as much of your time as

111
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,360
possible and therefore the consequences

112
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,080
are all downward downwind of that and so

113
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
he he described it as a as a vampire

114
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
rather than a dracula we didn't quite go

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
with that analogy in the book because i

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,040
thought it was a little difficult to

117
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,439
explain and get into but um it was it

118
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,879
was one of those great moments for me as

119
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,959
a reporter where it's why these

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,040
interviews are so important it's why we

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,400
interviewed

122
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,760
hundreds and hundreds of people that

123
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
work at this company because they all

124
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,320
they're the ones that that seeded the

125
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
ideas that we presented in this book and

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
how many people did you interview oh god

127
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,759
what was the i have to look at the book

128
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,880
i can't even remember it's been a while

129
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,080
since i've been one of these interviews

130
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
i feel like our final count was like

131
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
500 what was our final account do you

132
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
remember i was i thought it was over 400

133
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,199
it was over 400 people yeah

134
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,800
hundreds of hundreds of hundreds i

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,720
remember we had to tally up the number

136
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,120
of hours of interviews we had done at

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,960
one point and it was in the thousands it

138
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,199
was close to like six thousand hours

139
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
oh okay that's that's a lot of hours

140
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
yeah and and for me that was it was

141
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
really interesting to see that because i

142
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
think

143
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
uh although i uh you know based on my uh

144
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
prior career at the dnc saw some of

145
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,040
these things from the outside but also

146
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
with a little bit of an insider's view

147
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
this idea that the algorithms were just

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
running away and if only they could tune

149
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,199
them the right way everything would get

150
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,320
fixed

151
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
i i think even i had a little bit of a

152
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,960
misconception about that and so

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,160
then i you know the rest of the book

154
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
kind of lays it all out and makes makes

155
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,800
the case

156
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
um

157
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,759
so let's we have a number of people here

158
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,479
interested in cyber security and privacy

159
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,199
and things like that

160
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
one of the things that i've noticed in

161
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
my career

162
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,120
is that there are sometimes

163
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,320
events that surprise executives uh

164
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,240
especially around i do cyber security so

165
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,320
that would be where i would see this

166
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,639
and um and so i saw a number of of cases

167
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,199
where executives were surprised

168
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
when they were given information

169
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,520
um and it seemed

170
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,039
and i want you to tell whatever stories

171
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,520
come to mind but uh but there were some

172
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,400
some stories where they got information

173
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,800
and it seemed to be late breaking news

174
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
to them when in fact people around the

175
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
organization had known about that and so

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,880
i'm kind of interested in in executive

177
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,479
surprise

178
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,520
in general

179
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
yeah it's one of those things that we

180
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,520
really struggled with because we we

181
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,440
interviewed a lot of people that had

182
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
been raising flags at facebook for for

183
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,600
years ahead of the 2016 elections and

184
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,039
i'm just going to use that as an example

185
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,039
i could have used myanmar or india or

186
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,360
any number of other issues facebook had

187
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,319
as a company um but let's take the 2016

188
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,520
elections which you're well familiar

189
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,479
with so it was so interesting to hear

190
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,039
that a year before the 2016 elections

191
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,120
even happened you had people on the news

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,000
feed team saying what's going on why are

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
all these bizarre sites at the top of

194
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
our news feed why where are these sites

195
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,440
coming from we see the ip addresses in

196
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,039
macedonia wherever else like shouldn't

197
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,639
we get to the bottom of this and you

198
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,919
have executives at the top of the

199
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,360
company saying

200
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,199
no it's fine like it's what people are

201
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,880
you know they're funny they're this the

202
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,120
excuses are given right and then you

203
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
have alex damos's team the the security

204
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
team at facebook again this is i think

205
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,120
roughly eight months before the

206
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,800
elections saying we're worried about

207
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
russia like we've seen signs of it in

208
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,520
ukraine and estonia and lithuania there

209
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,440
is a model of russia tampering in

210
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
elections and we're worried about this

211
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,080
happening here we're going to beef up

212
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,759
our security i mean they've already

213
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,360
beefed it up really at this point but

214
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,720
we're just going to pay extra attention

215
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,520
here

216
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
and again what surprised me is that you

217
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
don't have anybody in the executive

218
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,520
level of the company saying oh that

219
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,199
seems alarming why don't i have a

220
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,800
monthly meeting with you or a weekly

221
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,080
meeting with you and you'll update me

222
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,319
about what you found they just kind of

223
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,120
file these reports into the ether um

224
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,039
leading up to really the month before

225
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,039
the november 2016 elections when at this

226
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,280
point they're like finding people

227
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
they find this russian hacker guccifer's

228
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,280
team of hackers who are now sending

229
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,039
journalists leaked documents from the

230
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
dnc using facebook they're on facebook

231
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,479
messenger they're sending these and

232
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,919
they're not just sending them they're

233
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
framing them and saying hey you know

234
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,039
clinton's going to give a speech

235
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,759
tomorrow why don't you guys drop these

236
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,000
emails that we hacked from the dnc

237
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,319
tomorrow at 4pm and they're having like

238
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,440
a real conversation where they're

239
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,199
clearly trying to manipulate

240
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,199
mostly right-wing bloggers into doing

241
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
their bidding and the security team is

242
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,879
watching this in real time and i'll

243
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,479
never forget this engineer's face like

244
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,800
he's horrified he's

245
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,319
watching this unfold in front of him and

246
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
he's like you know his arms are up in

247
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,440
the air at this point like alex you know

248
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
stimulus come on you know everyone's

249
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
worried on the security team but the

250
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
executives are still kind of like great

251
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
reports are filed we've noted this thing

252
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
let's have a discussion about whether or

253
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
not we should remove the guccifer

254
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,879
account which i thought was like

255
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,320
it took them i think almost six months

256
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,399
to decide to remove the guccifer account

257
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,000
um

258
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,760
and you do not have this five alarm fire

259
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,679
feeling at facebook where executives are

260
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,159
finally asking for like well weekly and

261
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,320
then daily meetings until almost nine

262
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,800
months after the 2016 elections at this

263
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,600
point

264
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
the u.s intelligence establishment has

265
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,720
already come out and declared you know

266
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,920
all the agencies have come out and

267
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,680
declared yes russia interfered in the

268
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
election yes we think facebook played a

269
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
role in it and you still don't have this

270
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,279
feeling of urgency among executives that

271
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
they really need to pay attention to

272
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
what their security officials have been

273
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,040
trying to tell them for for months

274
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,160
and i think there was a real sense of um

275
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,560
exasperation and depression among a lot

276
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
of people on the security team that

277
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,640
you know i remember having these

278
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
conversations with them where they they

279
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,040
would ask me like what should we have

280
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
done differently and i'm like oh dude

281
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
try to get the attention of a new york

282
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,920
times editor like it's not it's not much

283
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
easier um

284
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
but you know they they said should i

285
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
quit should i have marched into mark

286
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
zuckerberg's office and slammed down the

287
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
door and said pay attention to this this

288
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,399
is actually critical you know a critical

289
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
report that i'm filing here and you have

290
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,920
to make this your priority

291
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,320
um while he's off like milking cows in

292
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
in idaho and whatever else he did that

293
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
year as part of his tour of the united

294
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,920
states it's i don't envy the positions

295
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,440
of people on the security team because

296
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,600
they're always bringing bad news or not

297
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,120
always but they're often bringing bad

298
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
news to people who want to hear good

299
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,959
news and i think we noted in the book

300
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,640
cheryl sandberg's conference room is

301
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,120
called only good news

302
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
imagine being that person who's got a

303
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
knock on her door and say hey you've got

304
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
a huge problem on your hands that your

305
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,560
democratic allies in washington dc are

306
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
not going to be happy with

307
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
yeah i think i actually wrote that down

308
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,279
because i

309
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,440
when i hit that point

310
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,560
it really was a little bit of a

311
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
flashback for me when uh you know i was

312
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
dealing with the yahoo cleanup and one

313
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
of the things that and by the way people

314
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,560
don't actually know this but most of the

315
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,000
information about the yahoo hack is

316
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,440
public because

317
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,800
we worked with the uh with the fbi and

318
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
with the justice department and they

319
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,760
worked with their domestic and

320
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,279
international partners

321
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,560
and that resulted in an indictment so it

322
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
and they found that was two fsb officers

323
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
and two criminal hackers who were

324
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,040
involved so those four people were

325
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,440
indicted uh fsb officers obviously were

326
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,279
in in russia the criminal hacker was in

327
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,079
russia the um the other criminal hacker

328
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,480
was in canada and so he was arrested

329
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,040
extradited and so um you know that whole

330
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
story is actually well told in the

331
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
indictment and so anyone who's

332
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
interested in the mechanics of how these

333
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
attacks work and how uh foreign

334
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,399
governments blend with uh with the

335
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,399
criminal element uh it's it's really a

336
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,160
fascinating it's kind of a trashy spy

337
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,480
novel i wrote about that i that

338
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
indictment was great reading um you know

339
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,079
in the middle of the night in the snow

340
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
the the intelligence officials are in

341
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,360
the front yard of the guy that's been a

342
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,120
hacker it's a it's a great story it is

343
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,399
it's a fascinating story but the other

344
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,800
thing is and again this is all public

345
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,200
yahoo issued a 10k report for 2016 and

346
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,959
about the hack and the special committee

347
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,959
of the board had a couple of paragraphs

348
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,240
in there and

349
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,480
the reason that particular conference

350
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,920
room struck a nerve with me and some of

351
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,880
these other stories is that it said that

352
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,720
the security team had contemporaneous

353
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,240
knowledge of the 2014 yahoo hack

354
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
and there's a section in there that says

355
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
and the executives uh had sufficient

356
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,760
information to warrant further

357
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,519
investigation but did not take action

358
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
and that's probably close to an exact

359
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,440
quote and uh but please go read it for

360
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,600
yourselves and so i i've seen this this

361
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,320
story before and and so that's why i was

362
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,519
curious about this and i was going to

363
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,040
ask you if you have advice for the

364
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,880
security and privacy people in the

365
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,959
audience but yeah it's it's really not

366
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,279
easy i i would say that you don't want

367
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,639
to be in the position of a new york

368
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,040
times reporter calling you and asking

369
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,200
did you fail to raise the alarm like you

370
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
want to be in a position of saying yeah

371
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,920
i filed the report i raised the alarm

372
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
because it won't just be us that are

373
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
calling you it'll eventually be the fbi

374
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
it'll eventually be law enforcement

375
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
and you want to know you did your best

376
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
and you did your job and i think it

377
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,839
sometimes is very easy and i've spoken

378
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,200
to engineers who have faced the pressure

379
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,040
themselves from executives who have

380
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,399
asked them if they can amend their

381
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,639
reports or not file a report on

382
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,120
something troubling that they have seen

383
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,639
and they have felt that you know

384
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,320
firsthand in fear of losing their jobs

385
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,959
and i think that it's crucial you know i

386
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,279
i as a reporter sometimes write articles

387
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,240
about things that i find difficult and

388
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,000
i you know i always just say to myself

389
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,279
well i have to do what's right because i

390
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,480
have to be able to defend what i did

391
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
here i have to be able to one day be

392
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,680
able to answer my children law

393
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
enforcement whatever and say i wrote

394
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,200
that because it was the most accurate

395
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
version of what had happened i mean i i

396
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,680
don't we'll get into journalism later

397
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,120
but like you know many journalists when

398
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
we describe our jobs to people we

399
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
describe it as bearing witness and

400
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
that's really what we think of it as

401
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
like we're not you know we're not there

402
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,279
to be columnists or these reporters like

403
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,800
myself are not there to be columnists

404
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
we're not op-ed writers we bear witness

405
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
we want to be able to portray accurately

406
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
what we're seeing because we do think of

407
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,480
ourselves as really a first draft of

408
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,160
history and something that you know

409
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,240
later people can build on and examine

410
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
further and so yeah when i report

411
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,839
something i make sure it's as accurate

412
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,920
as possible and not my version of the

413
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,079
truth but the most sort of objective

414
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,839
version i can get gathered from as many

415
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,680
people as possible i think engineers

416
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,120
sometimes at least engineers i've spoken

417
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
to sometimes think of it in much the

418
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,880
same way and that you know it's not

419
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
always what i wanted to happen like i

420
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,519
wanted to report that everything was

421
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,199
great and every safety mechanism we put

422
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,199
into place was you know flying colors

423
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,040
and there's no red flags but actually

424
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,399
this thing i thought was a great idea

425
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,959
was a terrible idea and it failed and it

426
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,880
had lots of issues with it and i'm gonna

427
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
have to tell my boss that that happened

428
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
and that's that's hard

429
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,079
yeah i i think that it is it is a very

430
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
hard thing i do think uh

431
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,680
if you think about a timeline and if you

432
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,040
think about a boom where there's some

433
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,839
sort of event

434
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,079
um right of boom everyone has 20 20

435
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,480
hindsight and so the actions that you

436
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,560
take left of boom should really be

437
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,720
informed by the way that people will

438
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,120
naturally wear their hats whether it's

439
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,959
an investigator whether it's the ceo

440
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,199
whether it's reporters

441
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
think about what it looks like right of

442
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,680
boom because everyone will think

443
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,519
that the things that you did or didn't

444
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,320
do

445
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,680
they'll look at it in a very different

446
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,360
light and so

447
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,639
yeah i don't know if people should

448
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,720
necessarily have quit but but there are

449
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,680
sometimes ways of of getting attention

450
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,320
um having said that there may be some um

451
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,600
some patterns here that may have made

452
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
that more difficult than other other

453
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
places one of the things that

454
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,920
i also noticed uh and maybe we can tease

455
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,760
this apart a little bit there was the

456
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
internal i think reluctance to come to

457
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,040
certain conclusions but then there was

458
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,440
sort of a almost a mirror of that when

459
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
it was time to reveal that information

460
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
externally any any interesting stories

461
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
along those lines yeah i mean i think

462
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,120
that the decision to reveal it

463
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,360
externally really was because of the

464
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,880
pressure that was coming down on them

465
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,959
from congress from intelligence

466
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,560
officials from from the media from

467
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,079
journalists that were writing article

468
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,760
after article about how

469
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,079
you know they were finding ira ads they

470
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,759
were finding you know there was a report

471
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,920
in time magazine about how there was an

472
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,639
intelligence report on uh the ira buying

473
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,560
advertisements on facebook and and

474
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
steering that kind of content to us

475
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,320
citizens and so i think facebook got to

476
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
a point where they thought we have to

477
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,839
control this narrative right we have to

478
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,360
come out with what we know

479
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,680
and um it's interesting to me because

480
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
you know we obviously have this in the

481
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,480
book but when they do so they try to

482
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,279
initially at least frame it as

483
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,800
the smallest possible version of the

484
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,199
problem so they try to minimize

485
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,440
exactly what the effects have been and

486
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
it takes a while for you know weeks

487
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,920
actually for them to revise this blog

488
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
post and revise their findings and come

489
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,240
out with the extent of what they know

490
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,120
and

491
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,959
it it i mean there was just trust

492
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,880
already but i think just that initial

493
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,560
one month time period of when they went

494
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
public with what they knew did a lot to

495
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
deepen distrust between facebook and

496
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,279
members of congress and uh i i'm always

497
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,639
again i'm always a witness to these

498
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,920
things but i've noticed that when

499
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,079
companies mess up or when something bad

500
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,440
it's not even maybe let's say the

501
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,560
company didn't but something bad

502
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
happened to them

503
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,079
if they come out out of the gate and

504
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,240
they you know really lay it bare and say

505
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,759
this is how big the problem was here's

506
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,759
everything right like let's let's just

507
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,079
show that is always a better situation

508
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
to be in than to have it be drips and

509
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,240
drabs and leaks and then the media finds

510
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,680
some other person that leaks them you

511
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,199
don't you don't want to be in that

512
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,880
situation where you're caught in a

513
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,480
two-week news cycle

514
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
where people are increasingly hearing of

515
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,000
all the ways you messed up and all the

516
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,839
things that went badly

517
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
and as it was interesting because you

518
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,519
know facebook obviously you know has has

519
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,199
incredibly smart pr people that work for

520
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,199
them but they also had executives that

521
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
thought even then that they could sort

522
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,039
of minimize the problem when we

523
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,119
originally wrote um

524
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,400
the article that became this book the

525
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,799
article was called delay deny deflect

526
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,919
and it was because that kind of

527
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,359
described the pattern that had happened

528
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,000
at facebook they delayed looking into

529
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,839
their problems they then denied the

530
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,119
extent of the problems and then they

531
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,319
tried to deflect from it when they

532
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,679
eventually did go public with what they

533
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,199
knew yeah

534
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
can we talk about disinformation yeah

535
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
yeah let's talk about that

536
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,919
so

537
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,600
so obviously my time at the dnc we had

538
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
to start a counter disinformation

539
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,400
program and uh and you know we we tried

540
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
to work with all the different companies

541
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,600
to to try to minimize harm and to try to

542
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,360
get the right stories out there

543
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,720
you know facebook was an interesting

544
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,200
case uh there were times when we'd

545
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,120
report clear violations of the terms of

546
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,559
service and they would do the right

547
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,200
thing there were other cases which you

548
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
can probably all guess which ones they

549
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
were where

550
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,679
the the people that we worked with who

551
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,840
by the way were amazing people you know

552
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,200
the folks that we worked with you know

553
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
just had a great relationship with them

554
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,240
hats off to them

555
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
but they'd often have to go

556
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
run these requests up the chain

557
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,000
and we kind of knew what the answer was

558
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,760
going to be the only question is what is

559
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,480
the

560
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,679
what is the context that they're going

561
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
to provide around that and it seemed

562
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
like a lot of these decisions and again

563
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,880
this is this is my bias let me just put

564
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,400
that out there and you can correct me in

565
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
whatever way you want but it seemed like

566
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,760
many of these decisions were foregone

567
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
conclusions they just needed to find the

568
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,840
right talking points to in the right

569
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
context they needed to be lawyered they

570
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
wanted it lawyered i mean i'm to be

571
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,919
blunt like i think a lot of these

572
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,600
companies you know again we speak to

573
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,120
people at the top and they're like well

574
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,880
we we sometimes have a gut feeling of

575
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,480
what the right decision is but then we

576
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
say well how do we defend that to a

577
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,919
board how do we defend that in case

578
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,200
there's a lawsuit

579
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,039
everything that they do has to go

580
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,640
through lawyers and so i'm going to go

581
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,320
back to the example of some of the

582
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,600
russian accounts that they found

583
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
initially they didn't take them down

584
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
because there were questions of under

585
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,880
what rules there was no rule at facebook

586
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
that you couldn't spread disinfo and so

587
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,480
they kind of tied themselves in knots

588
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,480
and eventually one of the long time

589
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,960
engineers at the company um

590
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,720
came up with this i think fairly

591
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,559
interesting idea where the same russian

592
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,160
hackers that leaked the dnc stuff had

593
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,919
gone after george soros as well and

594
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,679
leaked some of his stuff including

595
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,280
personally identifiable information of

596
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
some people who worked for him so using

597
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
facebook's rules that you cannot share

598
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
the personal identifiable information of

599
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
someone without their knowledge they

600
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,799
took down the account so it was like

601
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,880
this loophole clause that allowed them

602
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,160
to do what they actually wanted to do

603
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,919
which was eliminate the account of a

604
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,840
russian hacker who was you know wreaking

605
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,919
quite a bit of havoc on the platform

606
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
now i'd say things are quite different

607
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,840
and that they have much broader policies

608
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,440
about disinformation we you know we get

609
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
these monthly reports which are really

610
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,120
excellent done by nathaniel gleicher and

611
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,240
his team on um you know different um

612
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
what's the cib

613
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,080
the acronyms different coordinated

614
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
inauthentic behavior that they take down

615
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,320
and there's a lot more transparency

616
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
around that i think facebook's struggle

617
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
is now the gray area what do you do in a

618
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880
country like ukraine which has

619
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
russian nationals living in ukraine who

620
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,159
are ukrainian citizens who are spreading

621
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,000
misinformation to other ukrainian

622
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,760
citizens about what russia is doing

623
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,200
along the border like that is an

624
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,440
unfolding situation happening right now

625
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,960
in ukraine which i personally find

626
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,559
fascinating because it's almost like a

627
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,080
worst case scenario of what could happen

628
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,159
here in the united states and and some

629
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,919
extent has happened really

630
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,520
some of the things that we noticed was

631
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
this uh transformation of disinformation

632
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,039
from a foreign-based uh problem to one

633
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,880
that was homegrown

634
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,720
any observations from your interviews

635
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,000
with folks at facebook around that

636
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,360
transformation and how they dealt with

637
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,559
it

638
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,080
yeah i mean i i think there's a lot of

639
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,360
regret that they weren't paying more

640
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,120
attention early on in 2013 2012 to what

641
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
russia was doing in a lot of eastern

642
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,919
europe there was a sense of they

643
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,159
wouldn't dare to do it in america and

644
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,840
and i and i do think there was a sense

645
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
of well it's not that big a problem when

646
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,200
it's happening in another country

647
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,320
um

648
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,919
ultimately we're an american company we

649
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,919
have to answer to u.s senators i think

650
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,679
if it was happening in western europe or

651
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,799
in america it would have been a very

652
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,400
different situation

653
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,799
but when the people dying are in myanmar

654
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,640
or the politician whose website is being

655
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,400
defaced and having their emails hacked

656
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
is in

657
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
you know ukraine or lithuania

658
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,360
then it becomes less of a priority you

659
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,720
have one person at the company who's

660
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
dealing with it rather than a hundred

661
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,880
um i still think there are incredible

662
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,919
lessons to be learned with what's

663
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,760
happening in real time in countries like

664
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,080
india and indonesia i look at you know

665
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,640
the spread of misinformation on whatsapp

666
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,679
in india as a real warning to us here in

667
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,760
the united states of what's to come and

668
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,679
i don't think we have great solutions or

669
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,120
the tech companies i say don't have

670
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
great solutions for how they're going to

671
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,400
cope with it i say we because as a

672
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,760
journalist i think about this all the

673
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
time i write about misinformation and i

674
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,320
feel like there is you know that that um

675
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,559
what's then the iceberg in the ocean and

676
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
it's all you know that's that's for me

677
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,080
what's up that's encrypted messaging is

678
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,440
everything happening below the surface

679
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,200
that i have no clue about unless someone

680
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,120
happens to forward me a message

681
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
um so i think about that all the time

682
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
and i think about how we're still sort

683
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,760
of failing to learn the lessons of

684
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,280
what's happening in other countries yeah

685
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,400
and there's a lot of different topics

686
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,000
too obviously the one that we're we hear

687
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
a lot about these days is covid uh you

688
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,039
went on fresh air a few weeks ago and

689
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,799
you you had a little story that said

690
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,120
that just today i saw the very type of

691
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,640
information that mark zuckerberg and

692
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,000
sheryl sandberg had said they wouldn't

693
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
tolerate about kovitz still online

694
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,919
and active on facebook did anything

695
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,320
happen from that i mean obviously i'm

696
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,679
sure somebody over there listens to

697
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,520
fresh air and would have heard that and

698
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
did you get any follow-up on that

699
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
no not directly i mean i got calls from

700
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,919
from people that work in there in the pr

701
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,840
department who i speak to regularly who

702
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,159
wanted to press me on it um you know i

703
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,679
think the covert misinformation thing

704
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
has been really really tricky for them

705
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,799
because

706
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,559
a lot of it isn't black or white a lot

707
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,440
of it is um it's not i mean what one

708
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
person's misinformation is another

709
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,640
person's truth right um you know you you

710
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,200
may you know you the people here in this

711
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
room may believe that everyone should be

712
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,039
vaccinated and wear a mask and have

713
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,120
certain you know do certain things to

714
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,559
prevent the pandemic from growing and

715
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,640
someone in another you know in another

716
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,159
state may not believe all those things

717
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,440
and facebook is in a very tricky

718
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,480
position right now but coveted

719
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,559
misinformation i do think it was

720
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,000
interesting that mark zuckerberg really

721
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,200
kind of put his foot down in the

722
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,559
beginning of the pandemic and said we

723
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
will not tolerate this and he took quite

724
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,480
a strong stance and then almost

725
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,559
immediately he was challenged by donald

726
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,799
trump saying things like well you know

727
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,039
bleach and uv light is gonna help us

728
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,400
cure covet

729
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,840
and um

730
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
you know in that moment really when they

731
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
decided not to remove the comments of

732
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,760
the then president they they made a call

733
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,360
right they made a call to allow certain

734
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,200
types of misinformation about kova to

735
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,919
persist on facebook that to this day i

736
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,679
see videos

737
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,279
shared of trump's time as president and

738
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,640
him talking about uv light

739
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,000
it is

740
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,240
it is very tricky and i think that not

741
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,520
to get too historic here but the

742
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
anti-vaccine movement has been

743
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,200
incredibly smart about how they use

744
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,480
social media

745
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,600
um to recruit and gain new followers and

746
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,120
in a way i think they've been two steps

747
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
ahead of tech companies for years and

748
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,720
the pandemic has just provided them an

749
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,559
opportunity to show just how effective

750
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,320
their social networks are

751
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,640
some of the traffic has moved into

752
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,559
facebook groups

753
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,480
can you tell us a little bit about that

754
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,679
and

755
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,720
transparency and how what your reporting

756
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,120
shows about that transformation yeah i

757
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,520
mean facebook groups it's been it's been

758
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,200
quite intentional facebook as a company

759
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
has pushed people towards groups their

760
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,880
their design of their home page now

761
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
increasingly pushes you to join groups

762
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,720
and as a result you had all sorts of

763
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,279
movements i mean when um when militias

764
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,039
were still on facebook and when q anon

765
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,960
was still growing on facebook in 2020 it

766
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,720
was largely through facebook groups

767
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,880
because those groups were so easy to

768
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,720
join and the minute you joined one you

769
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,000
were immediately prompted to join

770
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,559
another i used i have a lot of facebook

771
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,480
accounts that i use for my reporting and

772
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,360
um

773
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
i like to tell the story that like every

774
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,279
every month or so i would just test it

775
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,880
right i would open up a facebook account

776
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,919
i would say i was a woman in her late

777
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,559
30s living in california

778
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,799
and i would join a group for something i

779
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,240
thought innocuous right like a local

780
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
school for children or kindergarten or

781
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,360
preschool or one time it was a group for

782
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,400
um best playgrounds to take your kids in

783
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
the east bay

784
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
i started as innocuously as i could and

785
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,520
then i would check and see how many

786
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
clicks it took for me to get pushed into

787
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,080
an anti-vaccine group and the most it

788
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,840
ever took in the eight i'd say eight

789
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,440
months i ran this experiment was four

790
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,760
clicks so within four clicks the

791
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,279
recommendation algorithm had me in an

792
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,799
anti-vaccine group no matter where i

793
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,559
started as long as i said i was a mother

794
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,159
and i had young kids

795
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,039
and i think that's incredibly telling um

796
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,799
i will say now things have changed a

797
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,679
little bit um i i've talked to facebook

798
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,039
about this many times and i do think

799
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,400
they're trying to figure out how to how

800
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,320
to change those recommendations but

801
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
still i'll get those recommendations i

802
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
mean i i will be in a group for natural

803
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,400
health common common cures for the cold

804
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
that kind of thing and almost inevitably

805
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,960
the next recommendation is vaccines kill

806
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
kids masks kill kids

807
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
fight masking in schools i mean these

808
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,120
are really heavily promoted groups in

809
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,360
facebook and um i'm not sure what the

810
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,240
company has planned um and how to and

811
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,760
how to confront that

812
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
uh so we talked about uh

813
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
bleach and uh light to cure things but

814
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
sometimes light can be a powerful

815
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,360
disinfectant it actually can be um and

816
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,080
you know one of the things that

817
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,799
that they have is a series of tools that

818
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,600
can be used by certain researchers to to

819
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,039
try to understand more about where

820
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,960
disinformation is going so one is called

821
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,400
crowdtangle

822
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,159
we were not able to get crowdtangle

823
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,919
accounts at the dnc

824
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,520
for reasons

825
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,360
whatever those are

826
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,679
and you know recently they just

827
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,919
announced they're going to pause new

828
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,559
memberships on crowdtango which is again

829
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,480
one of the ways that that we get some

830
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,400
additional reporting on what's actually

831
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,240
happening which i would argue is

832
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,600
probably good for the company i mean

833
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
it's kind of free researching and

834
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
free pen testing but crowdtangle has

835
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,679
been a thorn in their side for a very

836
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,400
long time um i speak to a lot of people

837
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,159
who work on crowd tingle were once part

838
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,240
of that team and the team i mean you

839
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,360
call it what you will they call it a

840
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,720
reorganization but the team was really

841
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,960
dismantled um roughly six months ago and

842
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,400
scattered across the company and a lot

843
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,760
of people who were original members of

844
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,480
crowdtangle have left um including

845
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,200
brandon who was there it wasn't ceo but

846
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
he was there he was their their head for

847
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,880
a long time um

848
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
i think that that the people who work

849
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,080
currently on crowdtingle say it's a

850
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,919
matter of time before facebook takes

851
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,600
down access entirely which is very

852
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,279
concerning for journalists and academics

853
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,880
including myself i do a lot of research

854
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,159
on crowdtangle

855
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,760
and

856
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,120
facebook is not always happy with the

857
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,039
research we do right the the my

858
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,720
colleague kevin roos

859
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,480
leading up to 2020 elections had this

860
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,399
running list of here are the top 10 most

861
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,720
popular stories on facebook facebook

862
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
hated those lists that he made i think

863
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,840
we have it somewhere in the last chapter

864
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
of our book but they used to call crisis

865
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,640
meetings over kevin's tweets of like oh

866
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,720
no kevin's tweeted again and the top 10

867
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,039
list makes us look awful and you know

868
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,640
and they wanted to publish their own

869
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,159
list of the top 10 most popular

870
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,880
according to their own metrics but then

871
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,559
the first report they did on it actually

872
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,600
showed that this

873
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
anti-vaccine group was at the very top

874
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
of the list so then they decided not to

875
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
base the report on january but on

876
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,120
february i mean they literally changed

877
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,240
the month on which they were going to do

878
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,279
the report this is the beginning of

879
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,440
2021.

880
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,200
and so yeah the company isn't happy with

881
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,799
what the data is showing and i think

882
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,159
they'd like to portray their own version

883
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,000
of the data which is guided by them and

884
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,679
their metrics and that's really

885
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,600
concerning to journalists because we

886
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,279
already don't have a lot of visibility

887
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,679
into youtube right we already struggle

888
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,000
for visibility into all these other

889
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,520
into all these other places that we know

890
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,120
that misinformation is being spread and

891
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
as much as crowdtangle i know doesn't

892
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,320
always show facebook in its best light

893
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,399
it is a little window into what is

894
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,720
happening on facebook and i think it's

895
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,159
critically important for academics and

896
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,440
journalists to have that and to have

897
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,679
even more transparency um i'll note that

898
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,960
there are several bills that are going

899
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,159
through congress right now which

900
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,760
actually would force tech companies to

901
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,559
give

902
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,039
specifically academics some access to

903
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,960
data and more transparency into what

904
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,720
happens and i'm i'm very curious to see

905
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,559
if those bills pass because as a

906
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,559
reporter i'm happy to have vetted

907
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,679
academics get that kind of access

908
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,600
you know i would love to not spend hours

909
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,039
of my day going through data i have

910
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,679
other things i'd love to be doing um and

911
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:18,960
i do think going forward it's going to

912
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
be important for you know perhaps

913
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,080
legislation to be formed around this so

914
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,600
it is mandated that there's some level

915
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,279
of transparency

916
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,399
um

917
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,120
so

918
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
the book was published when

919
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,520
the book came out in in oh god it was

920
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,200
off the top of my head it came out in

921
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,960
july of last year

922
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,720
six months ago yeah so

923
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
a few things have happened uh

924
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,799
some things have happened so you know i

925
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,360
think we're we're learning more about uh

926
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,919
the the lead up to january 6 and and

927
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,240
those kinds of topics um what sort of

928
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,679
things are you learning from from your

929
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,000
investigations there

930
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,039
um

931
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,159
you know i think we're learning

932
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,440
well i don't know i've been thinking

933
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,200
about this a lot recently i think we're

934
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,720
learning about really just how systemic

935
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,919
the problems are with some of the

936
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,760
extreme extremist movements that have

937
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,440
taken hold in the u.s um you know

938
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,880
cheryl sandberg gave a speech right

939
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,320
after i gave up i should say not a

940
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
speech but an interview right after

941
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,000
january 6th and when she said that you

942
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,440
know basically hadn't happened on

943
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,080
facebook and i think what she meant by

944
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,520
that was that organizations like the

945
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,120
proud boys and the other militias had

946
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,039
organized on telegram and gab and other

947
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,279
places and she's right because by the

948
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,880
time january 6th happened the proud boys

949
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,799
were not on facebook but what she

950
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,480
ignored in that comment and what really

951
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,080
she got skewered for when she made that

952
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,399
comment is that the idea of stop the

953
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,480
steel the idea that the election had

954
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,880
been stolen was all over facebook it

955
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,240
launched on facebook and then it was

956
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,559
made popular by by donald trump himself

957
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,080
who who tweeted about it and posted

958
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,279
about it regularly on facebook and so

959
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,760
you know i i think you can't quite

960
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,399
underestimate how problematic it was to

961
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,399
have and to still have i would say

962
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,799
members of congress sharing the hashtag

963
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,360
stop the steal and even now i mean today

964
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
you can go to facebook and twitter and

965
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,679
find certain members of congress who are

966
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,000
sharing the idea that the 2022 midterms

967
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,320
are going to be stolen and that the

968
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,399
election uh infrastructure is already

969
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,320
corrupted and hacked and that democrats

970
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,080
have figured out a way to

971
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,960
you know

972
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,679
um to conspire with voting officials and

973
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,399
and and rig mail-in ballots and every

974
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,039
narrative that was there in 2020 is

975
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,519
going to come back in 2022. we know that

976
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,760
the stop the steel movement has not gone

977
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
away

978
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,799
um so yeah i mean i think in the wake of

979
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,279
january 6th i have continued to be

980
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,720
surprised with just how pervasive that

981
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,640
movement was and even now today i'm

982
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,519
shocked at how quickly they're growing

983
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,640
their ranks and preparing for the

984
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,760
midterms

985
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,840
and it seemed like it took a while for

986
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,760
them to catch on to that particular

987
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,159
movement and to to take action

988
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,240
um in light of all the things that

989
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,320
they've learned with with russians and

990
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,200
other other kinds of things um

991
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,360
any any thoughts on that well it's the

992
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
worst nightmare stop this deal because

993
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,880
not russia if it was russia it'd be

994
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,039
really easy right if it was russia click

995
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,200
you're gone like you know really easy

996
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,960
solution to the problem um it's

997
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,360
americans and americans have a right to

998
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,360
say certain things and it's it's even

999
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,880
more difficult when it's the president

1000
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,279
and members of congress who are saying

1001
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,679
these things and so i don't think

1002
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,279
there's an easy answer right they did

1003
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
take down the main stop the steel group

1004
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,120
because they repeatedly violated certain

1005
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,039
policies but by the time they took it

1006
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,480
down i think there was

1007
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,399
70 or 80 other stop the steel groups

1008
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,919
that had already formed and to this day

1009
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,200
there's quite a few stop the steel

1010
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,840
groups on on facebook um

1011
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,360
there isn't an easy answer for what you

1012
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,919
do for americans that are that are that

1013
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,840
are really sowing misinformation to

1014
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,399
other americans and i think a lot of the

1015
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,159
tech companies would love for it to be

1016
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,919
something congress solves right like

1017
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,360
let's kick it to congress let's have

1018
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,279
them make rules and say if you share

1019
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,360
this or that kind of information about

1020
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,279
an election it is illegal the same way

1021
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,279
that you cannot you cannot for instance

1022
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,559
mislead somebody about the day of an

1023
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,080
election if i go right now to facebook

1024
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,120
and i say oh the the 2022 elections are

1025
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
actually going to be in december this

1026
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,640
year that's not i can't do that

1027
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
but you can do everything short of that

1028
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,440
everything short of really

1029
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,039
disenfranchising somebody of the vote

1030
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,399
and sharing categorically false

1031
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,399
information i can do as an american

1032
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,640
citizen and so if the laws aren't there

1033
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,399
these tech companies are arguing how can

1034
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,360
they be asked to take action um i don't

1035
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,480
i don't think it's an easy thing to

1036
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,840
solve i think it's an incredibly

1037
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,360
difficult thing to solve and i don't

1038
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,039
think we've come close to solving it

1039
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,880
okay amazing thank you so much for

1040
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,360
coming by really appreciate it

1041
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,399
thank you all all right

1042
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,080
you
