1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
hello um uh thank you um

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,360
guys i'm justin uh this talk will

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,639
probably be a little bit different from

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,320
some other ones we've had i'm going to

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,240
focus a lot more on privacy than on

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,600
security

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,080
also i am not much of a technologist i

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,880
have a law policy background but i'll be

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
talking about a legal tool

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,359
a technical tool which may potentially

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,679
be helpful to solving a privacy problem

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,160
which is vexed us and evaded being

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,480
solved for decades and what's the

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,160
problem um

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,600
what we read about in the newspapers

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,920
every day this website sharing my data

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
with google and facebook you know this

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,160
app is sharing my geolocation with tons

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
of third-party companies um just

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
yesterday um a

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,559
european regulator found that the the

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,000
the cookie consent dialogues where

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
you're ostensibly agreeing to share um

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
your data with tons of real uh companies

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,719
for real-time bidding are illegal

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,239
um this is what i think of like one of

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,319
the fundamental problems around privacy

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,479
i think primary use people kind of get i

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
share my data with amazon to get to get

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
a package they process my credit card

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,080
they give it to fedex but that's all

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,680
like in service of what i'm asking for

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
it's just other stuff the sharing with

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,400
other data brokers monetizing my data

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,439
that's like i think one of the

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,320
fundamental issues that regulators um

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,720
and and practitioners have never really

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,119
solved for um so the question is like

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,640
okay how should we deal with it what

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,880
should we be doing um well first we

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,439
could just not which is a largely how

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,360
we've addressed it in the united states

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,040
that's obviously starting to change

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
there have been some self-regulatory

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,520
approaches over the last 20 30 years i

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,280
don't think anyone would meaningfully

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,439
argue that they've been enough we had a

48
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,079
little icon on most ads but no one

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
really clicks on those or or even tries

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
to manage um

51
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,960
the

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,479
opt-out processes that the trade

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
associations have

54
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,560
um we could mandate opt-in i think like

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,079
a lot of privacy advocates traditionally

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
said opt-in opt-in for everything um and

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,680
then we saw the

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,280
the experience in europe where every

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
single website you go to is it okay to

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,560
use cookies

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
yes fine leave me alone get out of my

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,680
way

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
and the companies have the ability to

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
design those interfaces and so we have a

65
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,800
result that makes no one really happy

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,120
we can do opt out we can say okay

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,400
the default's going to happen but you

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,920
have a chance to turn stuff off if you

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
want that's also super tedious that's

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,959
the approach we have here in california

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,040
you have to scroll under the ccpa the

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
new privacy law you have the right to

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,959
scroll to the bottom of a website click

74
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,280
do not sell my personal information deal

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
the user interface figure out what to do

76
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280
and then start all over with another

77
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,000
website um so that's not really optimal

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,599
either

79
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,519
you just ban it um

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,440
not that um this is an approach i think

81
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,480
privacy advocates have been kind of

82
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,800
picking up on in in recent years just

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,319
just say no we're going to prohibit a

84
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,319
lot of secondary uses um there's this

85
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,000
whole ban surveillance advertising

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
coalition let's just shut it down don't

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,440
ask my for my permission just end it um

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
this is approach we've seen in some

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,159
federal bills by senator brown um buffy

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,360
wicks of the bill in california that

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,560
would do this

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
we have a model bill that's largely

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,080
based on this approach

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,760
and so i think this this idea has some

95
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,879
promise

96
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,480
look at the end of the day you don't

97
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,440
want to

98
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,120
subvert free will if someone really

99
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
wants to share their data with the loom

100
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
escape and have targeted ads that's

101
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
totally fine i just worry if we rely

102
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,040
upon consent that like 90 times out of

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,840
100 or 99 times out of 100

104
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,360
it won't really really the volition of

105
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
the consumer they won't really

106
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
understand what's going on um

107
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,480
and so i think you know this idea of

108
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,120
just banning stuff is interesting we

109
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,959
recently submitted a white paper to the

110
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,200
federal trade commission um talking

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,280
about how the ftc could maybe mandate

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,599
this through existing law

113
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,360
and say that websites can't ask you

114
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,519
can't bother you can't torment you into

115
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
agreeing to stuff or make it hard to opt

116
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,439
out um but they should just you know

117
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,439
prohibit a lot of secondary uses that

118
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,760
people don't expect and or don't want so

119
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,439
this is a um

120
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,959
if you're interested in reading 40 pages

121
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,000
on this on on ftuc legal theory um this

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,439
is available to you

123
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,280
um and so this is this is my preferred

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
approach just shutting down a lot of

125
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
this stuff um but i think most of the

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,478
regulators we talked to like well this

127
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,320
is a little scary um

128
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,918
we're a little bit nervous about banning

129
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
all secondary use and so the place we

130
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
retreat to um is this idea of global opt

131
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
out so okay if you're not going to shut

132
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,160
it down by default and we don't want you

133
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,639
to torment everyone who goes to your

134
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,880
website maybe people should be able to

135
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,479
say you know what i just want out of

136
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,560
this i'm making an affirmative decision

137
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,800
um to just turn all this off this is the

138
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,840
idea

139
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
behind the do not call what registry

140
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
which did work for some time until found

141
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
people found ways to avoid it um through

142
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
voip ip address calling um but

143
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
conceptually if you're able to just

144
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
broadcast i wanna be left alone maybe

145
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,520
that's a workable privacy approach

146
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,040
and so like i said a lot of regulators

147
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
the regulators we've talked to have been

148
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
scared um to

149
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
bam stuff or require consent so they'll

150
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
say well yeah maybe an opt-out based

151
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
approach like under the ccpa

152
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
like i said it's not really practical to

153
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,639
do on a site-by-site basis it's also

154
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,520
very tedious like cookie consent screens

155
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
and i think like a lot of privacy rights

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,479
or maybe are hetero heterogeneous like

157
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
you know access and deletion rights you

158
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
probably

159
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
want you don't want to access everyone's

160
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
data all at once that would be

161
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,759
overwhelming you probably don't want to

162
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
delete all your data from every service

163
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,280
all at once like you might want to

164
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,039
delete spotify and tell them to get rid

165
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,160
of your account because you're mad at

166
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,759
them but you don't want to delete all

167
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,759
your frequent flyer miles or all your

168
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
amazon settings at once but if you don't

169
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,720
like your data being shared or sold

170
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,479
that's probably a universal sentiment

171
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,240
you want to be able to turn it all off

172
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,000
at once if you don't like the new york

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,280
times selling your data you probably

174
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,600
don't want espn or fox news or anyone

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
else selling your data too so it makes

176
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,440
sense that maybe there should be some

177
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,240
sort of mechanism to turn this off all

178
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
at once

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
um

180
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
and so this this is the the approach

181
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
i've been working on for a couple of

182
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,120
years

183
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
it's called the global privacy control

184
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,440
is the way to configure your browser to

185
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,400
kind of broadcast out with each um web

186
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
interaction hey don't sell or share my

187
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,400
data

188
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,759
it started out as an extension that you

189
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,400
can get for any browser store

190
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
or any browser now some browsers have

191
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,600
this pre-built in so

192
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,639
kind of more

193
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,400
brave and duck.go which obviously

194
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,720
differentiate on being privacy forward

195
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,240
mozilla is starting to experiment

196
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,479
putting this in into nightly and so you

197
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,719
can just

198
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
use these browsers to just broadcast um

199
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
you know while you're surfing the web a

200
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,319
universal preference um to be left alone

201
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,280
um and so i think an analogy for this um

202
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,520
i've seen this at some tech conferences

203
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,840
that were um uh once we started to come

204
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
back from covid we all have our lanyards

205
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
we have various ribbons on them um

206
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,160
there's a possibility of of choosing a

207
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,080
ribbon to designate how you want to

208
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,280
physically interact with people if

209
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,680
you're like i haven't seen anyone years

210
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,199
give me a hug i'm cool with it that's

211
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,319
like the green

212
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,400
if you want maybe more like elbow bump

213
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
that's that's some degree of intimacy

214
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,919
that i'm comfortable with but if you

215
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,360
don't want anyone to touch you right you

216
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
could just do this red one that says no

217
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,199
touchy right you're broadcasting to

218
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,599
everyone i don't want any of of this

219
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
business and that's the the sense behind

220
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
the global privacy control

221
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,960
broadcasting to everyone

222
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,319
no touchy

223
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
or don't share my data um and so again

224
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,720
this is from the the global privacy

225
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
control site you can turn it on um it

226
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,880
does broadcast a signal to all the

227
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,400
websites you you go to with that

228
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,919
particular browser

229
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,280
and it may have legal effects i'm going

230
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,560
to talk about that in a second but it

231
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
may

232
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
it may trigger legal consequences based

233
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,759
on your sending it

234
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,280
um this is a little bit about the

235
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,199
organizations that are involved in in in

236
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,680
this process um it was spearheaded by

237
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
oshkosh soltani independent researcher

238
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,639
he's now the executive director of the

239
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,440
new california privacy protection agency

240
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,039
um there are other advocates like like

241
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,319
eff um in in this group as well

242
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,759
like i said browsers like mozilla

243
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,400
duckduckgo brave um there's also some

244
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
publishers like the new york times and

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
the washington post which are like you

246
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,879
know we've lost

247
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,599
too much control over our advertising to

248
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,840
these big tech intermediaries and want

249
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
to kind of rest control back over it to

250
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,560
to the publishers

251
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,039
um let me talk a little bit about um

252
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,919
some of the the the technical issues um

253
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,879
i will not be able to answer any

254
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,559
detailed questions about these but like

255
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,958
i said it is sent in the in in a header

256
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,599
um to every in every um interaction and

257
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,440
every forwarded request

258
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
from your browser

259
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
and so this was detecting on my computer

260
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,480
i did not have it turned on so it said

261
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
the header is not present

262
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,640
it's also available in the dom property

263
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
same situation i did not have it

264
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
activated on this particular browser so

265
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,640
it's not detected and then finally

266
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,959
there's a a well-known resource

267
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,160
where you can publish to the world

268
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,720
whether you do um adhere to

269
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,480
or honor

270
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,800
global privacy uh signals and in this

271
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
case i was visiting the gpc site itself

272
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
and they broadcast out yes um version

273
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,640
one uh gpc is true we do uh acknowledge

274
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,000
and honor uh gbc requests

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
and so this is just uh um it is on

276
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
github it's available for

277
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
for comment um um let's say we just

278
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
processed some minor changes in the last

279
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,959
week or so if you have feedback um

280
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,720
please feel free to visit it make a pull

281
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,800
request um provide a comment um like i

282
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
said we are trying to evolve it um and

283
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
we want it to be workable um both for

284
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240
for for companies and also something

285
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,240
easily usable by consumers

286
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,839
and so you may be thinking this all

287
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,040
sounds familiar

288
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,600
have we tried this before uh we have in

289
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
fact i'll go back

290
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,600
we did spend several years trying to do

291
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
this on do not track um and this is an

292
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
image from the from eff's website they

293
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
also spent a lot of years trying to make

294
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,279
it happen

295
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,680
um a little bit on the history of that

296
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,279
and so this is an idea that was put

297
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,399
forward by privacy groups in 2007

298
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
again around this time privacy groups

299
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,000
were more like we want consent for

300
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
everything but if nothing else like

301
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
maybe we should be able to opt out all

302
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,240
at once i idea laid dormant for a couple

303
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
of years until um

304
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,399
the chief the chair of the ftc john

305
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
leibowitz was testifying before the

306
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,440
senate commerce committee is like you

307
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
know what maybe we should do this do not

308
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,399
track idea and that sent into effect a

309
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,079
flurry of activity all the major

310
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,760
browsers then put do not track into

311
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,200
their browsers

312
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
it was referred to w3c for

313
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
standardization started that process

314
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
there was a big event at the white house

315
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,880
i think in 2012 or so where um a lot of

316
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
the ad tech companies showed up and said

317
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,440
you know what we're going to do this

318
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
we're going to commit to honoring do not

319
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
track and fixing these problems that

320
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
which have have have

321
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,880
annoyed consumers for four years

322
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,839
um

323
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,200
and then things kind of went downhill

324
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,040
from there um

325
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,160
there was just

326
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,519
there was just no

327
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,279
give um there wasn't enough reason for

328
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,560
companies for everyone to come to

329
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,399
agreement they couldn't even agree on a

330
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,240
definition of the word tracking they

331
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,839
couldn't agree on what reasonable

332
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,440
exceptions were we couldn't really agree

333
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
on on much of everything

334
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
i think the biggest issue was that at

335
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
the time when the big white house event

336
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
happened there was a real threat of

337
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,560
legislation like there was a congress

338
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
was considering a bill from senators

339
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,959
kerry and mccain um the obama white

340
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
house had said we support privacy

341
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,320
legislation and a lot of companies were

342
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
like we don't necessarily want that um

343
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,120
but we will maybe self-regulate um or

344
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
adopt a more aggressive self-regulation

345
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,000
than we've been willing to do in the

346
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,040
past um then the regulatory pressure

347
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
kind of fell away um

348
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,279
the republicans retook the house and

349
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,880
republicans are traditionally less

350
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,399
interested in regulating privacy though

351
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,480
that's um that's changing um less

352
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,240
interested in regulation in general uh i

353
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,920
think we can fair to say um uh and so uh

354
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,320
the snowden revelations in 2013 happened

355
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
so a lot more attention on government

356
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,320
privacy and surveillance and about my

357
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,760
white house maybe looked hypocritical

358
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,839
for pushing consumer privacy um when the

359
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,800
nsa was collecting uh cell phone records

360
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
and so the regulatory pressure went away

361
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,920
and then there's maybe less need um or

362
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
less incentive for a lot of the ad tech

363
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
companies to come to agreement why agree

364
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,839
to honor this thing

365
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,600
and so the process

366
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,519
over several years but definitely broke

367
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
down and

368
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
didn't happen a lot of the browsers then

369
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,720
pulled do not track from the browser

370
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,760
because it wasn't doing anything in the

371
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
first place anyway

372
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
and so that was

373
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,279
a sad story um so what's different now

374
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,040
why why bang your head against the wall

375
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
and try to do it again

376
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
well for one we have new laws

377
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
the california consumer privacy act the

378
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,399
ccpa passed in 2018 written very rapidly

379
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,760
to forestall

380
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
a ballot initiative on privacy

381
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
but it does offer legal rights that did

382
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,519
not exist at the time of do not track

383
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
so one it gives you the right to opt out

384
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,920
of the sale of your data um and so and

385
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,399
they also say you can appoint someone to

386
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
opt out for you um because again like i

387
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,079
said it's tedious to for you to

388
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,880
individually opt out one by one

389
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
and then the the california attorney

390
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,839
general was

391
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,200
told to write regulations kind of

392
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,360
writing more detailed rules about this

393
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
and then they said explicitly that that

394
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,120
user enabled global global privacy

395
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
controls like a plug-in or a privacy

396
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,279
setting or device setting should be

397
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,000
interpreted as a legally binding

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
opt-out request and so if you do

399
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,279
broadcast through a global privacy

400
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,160
control

401
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,399
that should be in california at least

402
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,480
you taking advantage of your legal right

403
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,680
to turn off the sale of your data

404
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,639
and then

405
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,480
in january of last year this is attorney

406
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,200
general becerra um tweeting out that the

407
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
global privacy control the gpc should be

408
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
considered and treated by companies as a

409
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,920
legally binding opt-out in california um

410
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
i think some companies were annoyed that

411
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,920
this was the

412
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,000
major policy statements uh were done

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,519
through a tweet but since then the

414
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,839
california ag's office has updated their

415
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,560
website in in the faqs they say uh

416
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,320
global

417
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
adherence to global privacy control is

418
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,440
mandatory

419
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,120
they started sending out warning letters

420
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
to companies as they're required to do

421
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,279
in california um uh saying if you don't

422
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,199
uh change if you don't change your your

423
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,279
policies and start uh changing your

424
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,199
practices in response to gpc within 30

425
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,920
days um then there could be legal um

426
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
consequences there have we haven't seen

427
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,600
a lot of public enforcement um there

428
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,920
haven't been fines based on it um but

429
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,920
the they have been sending out warning

430
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
letters

431
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
um and so we're seeing other states um

432
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
do the same thing right colorado passed

433
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,800
the privacy law last year they

434
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
explicitly talked about browser-based

435
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
opt-outs in california um virginia has

436
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
legal opt-out rights now don't talk

437
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,279
about browsers but like maybe maybe this

438
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,880
is a way to uh

439
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
invoke those rights as well and we're

440
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,800
seeing tons of other legislation um

441
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,279
washington florida indiana um like

442
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,320
alaska

443
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,560
most of the states are considering other

444
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,240
other legislation and a lot of them like

445
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
they all most of them tend to be opt out

446
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
based but more and more they include

447
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,720
language around universal opt-outs

448
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
through privacy signals

449
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
okay so does it work um this is a good

450
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,399
question i'm not really sure

451
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,240
like i said the california ag has said

452
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
you have to do it but i haven't seen a

453
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
study and i haven't tried to get a sense

454
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,360
of you know how pervasive it is like

455
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,160
whether

456
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,920
how many sites have have a well-known

457
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,320
resource stating adherence to it um

458
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
which again it's not necessarily

459
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,279
mandatory is what you do with the data

460
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,600
that that legally matters um we do have

461
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,920
a bot trying to crawl and get a sense of

462
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
how many companies are doing it

463
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,399
but right now not really sure how

464
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,399
widespread adoption is

465
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,839
one problem is that there are a lot of

466
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,440
loopholes in ccpa like i said it was

467
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
written very quickly

468
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
that says you can opt out of the sale of

469
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
your data is is all they add tech stuff

470
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
really selling data you've heard people

471
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
we've heard advertisers say you know i

472
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,440
have cookie on my site i'm giving

473
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,519
facebook data i'm also giving them money

474
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,040
to advertise it's not really selling the

475
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,880
data is it um and so like debates about

476
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,480
the definition of sale

477
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
there's also language saying you know

478
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,360
you can share it with a service provider

479
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,519
as an exception and so some companies

480
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,480
are saying

481
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,839
everyone's a service provider we're all

482
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,279
service providers and that could be a

483
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
way around it

484
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,279
a lot of these loopholes are changed or

485
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,079
closed up in the in the cpra which is

486
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,639
the new california privacy law um that

487
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
was enacted through a ballot initiative

488
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,440
last year and so i will maybe see um

489
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
some companies who are claiming not to

490
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,279
be bound by these rights um the rights

491
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,320
will be a lot more expansive next year

492
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
um okay so this is a cool potential toy

493
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,560
right like i said like i i would prefer

494
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,680
something more aggressive but if we're

495
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
gonna go opt-outs maybe this is the way

496
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,519
to kind of let people have some some

497
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,240
some agency um oh no i don't want to

498
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
update that god sorry

499
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,639
um okay um

500
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,519
so there are but there are a few

501
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,959
limitations right so one is like there

502
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,320
are a lot of different laws right so

503
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
there are three in effect and that

504
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,600
doesn't even count nevada which does

505
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,279
actually have some some privacy law as

506
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,600
well um but there's tons more passing

507
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,560
laws and they're all a little bit

508
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,040
different um and so like something like

509
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
gpc which is universal saying hey don't

510
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,839
sell or share my data should that count

511
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,680
for each of these which which phrase

512
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,439
their rights in slightly different ways

513
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,280
i mean should you have to invoke i'm

514
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,199
invoking california law right um does

515
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,880
that mean uh the gpc is not uh a binding

516
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
like i said is can california other

517
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,240
states have not weighed in and other

518
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
states are still passing legislation so

519
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,760
it's going to probably be up to the

520
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
enforcers in those states decide to

521
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
decide whether a signal like gpc is

522
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,799
enough to to to invoke your rights

523
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,880
um also that europe's not on here but um

524
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,160
you know europe has uh uh in in gdpr

525
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,480
there's a concept of legitimate interest

526
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,000
where companies don't need to consent

527
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
you can still object and so should gpc

528
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,480
be considered an objection to that i

529
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,400
don't know again we'll we'll see what um

530
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
there's a lot happening in europe on

531
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,520
cookies right now anyway

532
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,400
um

533
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,960
okay so what about re-opt-in right what

534
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,799
what if the only effect of my turning on

535
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,520
gpc is that now every website i go to is

536
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,360
going to try to annoy me into ignoring

537
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,039
it and so this is not something i've

538
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,559
seen in the wild but you can this is

539
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,000
based on something i saw in the wild you

540
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,559
can imagine a shade on every site we

541
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,320
care about your privacy can we turn this

542
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
off to support free content and they

543
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
favor the sounds good thanks make it

544
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,679
bright blue the alternative is update

545
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,679
privacy settings which sounds annoying

546
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,360
and then there's a very gray not now at

547
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,280
the bottom so designed clearly to get

548
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
you to to give consent

549
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,559
i think this would be a really sad and

550
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,799
depressing outcome if this is what this

551
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,120
is what gbc does um there are like you

552
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
know right the law could forbid this

553
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,559
right

554
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,840
there is language in the digital

555
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,679
services act which is a new legislation

556
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
being uh considered in europe which

557
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,280
would if you have a global signal would

558
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,600
prevent them from tormenting you there

559
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,799
is language in

560
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,559
cpra the new

561
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,880
california law that tries to encourage

562
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,559
companies not to do this the language is

563
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,600
confusing um but this is a threat and i

564
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,799
think this would be a bad outcome for

565
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,000
everyone

566
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
certainly for consumers

567
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,559
um okay okay global that's nice but it's

568
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,559
only like a browser so how many

569
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,160
how many global controls do you actually

570
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,919
need and this is a this is a dated slide

571
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,840
that i had used at a presentation in the

572
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,320
in 2017 to the ftc on cross device

573
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
tracking but the idea is that you know

574
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
we have lots of different devices right

575
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,520
in lots of different platforms and so

576
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
even on one computer we use like three

577
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,360
or four browsers and there are lots of

578
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,559
other

579
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,200
entities that can share data about us do

580
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,600
i need to have a global privacy setting

581
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,200
enabled for my all these different

582
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,880
devices and different user agents and

583
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,200
that maybe you know it's

584
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
10 controls it's still better than a

585
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,160
thousand right and so it's an

586
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,919
improvement but do consumers have the

587
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,280
ability to to reasonably manage that

588
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
um how many different signals are there

589
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
right and so gpc that's our signal

590
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
without them um but you can imagine

591
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,320
other entities kind of creating their

592
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,600
own privacy signals and so um noib uh is

593
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
a civil society organization none of

594
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
your business based in somewhere in

595
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,679
central europe um and they've they're

596
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,520
creating a similar signal you know do

597
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,120
not track is out there still in some

598
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
browsers um

599
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,960
interactive advertising bureau could

600
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,559
create their own signal and you can

601
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,640
imagine um like lots and lots of other

602
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,320
signals developing

603
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,159
plus there are other signals on other

604
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,039
devices like limit ad tracking and so on

605
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,440
you're on ios and so you can imagine

606
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
like you know if you have 10 15

607
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,640
different signals on 10 15 different

608
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
devices and you're a company trying to

609
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,840
do the right thing this can seem

610
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
overwhelming and suddenly you get the

611
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
descend into the multiverse of privacy

612
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
signal madness um i think this is a

613
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,840
legitimate concern um you know i think i

614
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,919
i think there is um reason room for

615
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,159
agreement between advocates and and

616
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
companies like we don't want this y'all

617
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,919
don't want this and so there is maybe

618
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,320
some role for standardization

619
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,440
to

620
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,320
make it easy to comply

621
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,440
two more

622
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
i'm running out of time but um

623
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,120
loopholes like i said there are a ton of

624
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,600
loopholes in ccpa

625
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,559
well i think you should have the right

626
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,400
to turn off a lot of secondary sharing

627
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
and use do you want to turn off

628
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
everything like like you know some

629
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
companies share data for for security

630
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,039
which you know there are societal

631
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,039
benefits to that um some people talk

632
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,480
about we want to be

633
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,080
maybe if you can't do targeted ads at

634
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,520
least we want to see what ads are

635
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,440
effective we want to track

636
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,960
conversion

637
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,120
i think it's an open question i can see

638
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
arguments on both sides but

639
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,200
analytics like if you want to use a

640
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
company who's much better at analytics

641
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,080
than you

642
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
maybe that should be okay but then

643
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,559
you're still then you're vulnerable to

644
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,400
the same headline saying oh this app is

645
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,480
sharing data with with google um you

646
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,760
know i think it's a tricky question

647
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,159
about how to conform expectations um and

648
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,480
to yeah confirm

649
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,919
what actually happens in the web to what

650
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,320
people would reasonably expect

651
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,159
and then finally like

652
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,000
what what will work what if this works

653
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
what if this does actually turn off a

654
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
lot of targeted ads and you certainly

655
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
see apocalyptic

656
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,640
predictions about you know the the

657
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,240
internet burning down and free content

658
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,480
no longer being available

659
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,760
there's another image i wanted to use

660
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,840
for this which is a an old far side

661
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
cartoon of two dogs and there's a car

662
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
flipped over next to them they're like

663
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,280
oh crap we caught one what do we do now

664
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,120
um so i think it's a fair concern i

665
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,159
think some of these concerns are

666
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,080
overstated we've only had this much

667
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
behavioral targeting in in very recent

668
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,880
years um you know we had uh um you know

669
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,200
there was free content um in the 2000s

670
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,039
when behavioral targeting was was much

671
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,280
much more narrow we had small businesses

672
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,520
back then um but there are concerns

673
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,799
these things there will be less free

674
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,880
content um there are concerns there that

675
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,720
have uh i've heard raised varying

676
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
degrees of good faith um that these sort

677
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
of laws will be might empower the big

678
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,880
tech companies or make them only bigger

679
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,039
and more powerful um again i think those

680
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,480
are overstated but i think we should be

681
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,240
wide-eyed and and and aware of of what

682
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,679
what might go wrong and what the the

683
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,440
consequences of these sorts of decisions

684
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,120
will be

685
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,039
um and that's it like i said i love to

686
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,440
