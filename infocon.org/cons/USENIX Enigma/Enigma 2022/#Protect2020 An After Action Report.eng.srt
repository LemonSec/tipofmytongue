1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,480
okay so it says tba in the schedule uh

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,000
it took me a while to figure out what

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
exactly i wanted to talk about as well

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
as iterate on the title itself where i

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
landed was protect 2020 and after action

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,720
report so what you're going to get in

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
the next 20 minutes is my perspective my

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,199
view of what happened in the run up to

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,240
i have to stay at the lectern

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,479
my perspective on on the run up to the

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,079
2020 election some of the things that

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,520
transpired

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
and kind of some of the aftermath this

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,840
is not a literature review it's not an

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,399
academic study there's no quantitative

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
few statistics in it this is my

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
perspective these are some of the things

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,079
that i saw kind of from the inside out

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,200
and

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,320
following the traditional fema uh

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,640
incident after action report we're going

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,440
to walk through five steps so what was

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,280
supposed to happen what actually

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,760
happened what went right what went wrong

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,840
and how we need to approve again not a

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
literature review not an academic study

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,960
this is my perspective there are a few

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,799
people in the room and probably watching

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,159
online that were key

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,920
partners in here bob lords around here

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,960
somewhere i saw him uh there he is uh

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,600
and cameron dixon from sissa who's on

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
the committee as well there were a

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,439
number of people this was not the chris

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
krebs show this was not the sissa show

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,759
this was literally tens of thousands if

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,439
not hundreds of thousands of individuals

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
across the country that participated in

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
this effort this is just one person's

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,640
perspective

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,560
all right

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,040
so what was supposed to happen the 59th

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,920
quadrennial presidential election it was

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,479
also all house of representatives uh

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,200
members of congress as well as the class

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,399
two cohort of the senate so 33 every six

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,200
years or every rather two years we cycle

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,320
through 33 members of of the senate and

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
so that was this that was the the

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,079
playing field uh there's no question

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,840
that the stakes though from a political

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
perspective this was going to be one of

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,680
the most uh highly anticipated elections

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,399
in in uh in quite some time

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,000
more importantly from at least where i

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
stood from a security perspective this

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,599
was going to be one of the most

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,560
anticipated from a threat landscape what

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,680
does that do to that was the 2016

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
interference by the russians in the u.s

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,680
presidential election

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,599
the

63
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,319
2017

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,080
intelligence community assessment

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,160
released by director jim james clapper

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,239
lays out the three avenues of attack

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,080
that the russians

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,560
took undertook to interfere in the 2016

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
election the first was technical attacks

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,120
on election infrastructure the second

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
was

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,480
a hack and leak campaign against hillary

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
clinton's campaign in the dnc

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,440
and the third was this broader more

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,400
sustained and in you know in

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
nefarious insidious whatever you want to

77
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,280
call it

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,640
uh

79
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,560
disinformation operation this

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,159
information operations the russians are

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,640
incredibly proficient at and continue to

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
do to this day and i'm not you know i'm

83
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,879
sure a lot of us are also thinking about

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,519
what's happening in ukraine uh with with

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,599
the russian buildup on the border but

86
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,519
information operations and disinfo will

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,680
be a key part of whatever transpires

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
there whether they go kinetic or hot or

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,480
not this is just part of what they do

90
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,319
multiple forms of voting

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,040
not just in person on november 3rd but

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,920
early voting in person mail-in voting

93
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,560
and that's where a lot of ultimately the

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
confusion and disinformation operations

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,680
played out across that space and as i

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,159
mentioned based on 2016 there was an

97
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,080
incredible amount of anticipation and

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
scrutiny from the media from the

99
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,440
congress from the american public

100
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,280
as well as there was a significant

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,879
amount of

102
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
uh anticipation that the adversary would

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,720
come back and not just that the russians

104
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,959
would come back and play ball but that

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
they had put out a playbook and that we

106
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,840
would see other countries and other

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,200
state actors get into the game that we

108
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
may see china we may see iran we may see

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,720
north korea venezuela i could go on

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,959
there was an incredible amount of

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,760
anticipation expectation and tension

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,238
within within the aider and interagency

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,639
community so to combat that

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,880
working with us congress state and local

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,000
election officials there was a

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,320
significant amount of funding hundreds

117
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,040
of millions of dollars that went into

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
modernizing election systems and

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,360
improving the processes by which

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,759
elections were conducted

121
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,759
so what actually happened well about

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,160
this time two years ago kovit

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,520
kovitt had a dramatic effect on the

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,759
administration of the 2020 election not

125
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,320
just the general but also the primaries

126
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
so you saw a number of primaries were

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,800
delayed some of them flipped over to

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
mail-in but you also saw

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
the way there they were

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
the process by which you would show up

131
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
to the polls were changing so there were

132
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
there were long lines in many different

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,520
jurisdictions because six feet spacing

134
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,320
disinfecting machines and touch screens

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,400
swapping out literal one-time use pins

136
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
baffles things like that there's a lot

137
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,639
of friction introduced into the process

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,080
and so though there were had to be

139
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
adjustments

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
throughout notably though due to that

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,919
federal funding the resilience the

142
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,800
verifiability the audibility of the 2020

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,680
election changed dramatically improved

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,160
dramatically so according to the center

145
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
for election innovation and research

146
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,680
in 2016 about 80 percent of votes cast

147
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
in the u.s election

148
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,039
had a paper ballot associated with it

149
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
just like anything else in i.t if we

150
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,720
want to really get to root cause we want

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,080
to be able to audit that's what that

152
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,479
paper ballot allows you to do is audit

153
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,400
so there was a shift both from

154
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,639
investment as well as covid

155
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,680
that went from 80 percent to about 95

156
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,720
of the ballots uh cast so we had entire

157
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,120
states we had georgia and pennsylvania

158
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,440
notably switch from direct recording

159
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,919
equipment machines kind of of

160
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,160
of black or rather of defcon voting

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
village fame where you just touch a

162
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
screen and the votes stored down on you

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,360
probably did this in the last

164
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,759
enigma but stored down on removable

165
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,520
media so we swapped those out for ballot

166
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,919
marking devices that issued a paper

167
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,520
ballot there's some contention on

168
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
whether those the security of those

169
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,600
devices but nonetheless we had paper

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
records georgia went back and counted

171
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
three different times

172
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
in fact you had new jersey as well who

173
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
completely chopped over from those dre's

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,800
to

175
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,440
absentee ballot statewide so this was

176
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,919
this was a significant uh improvement

177
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
now that's like that's on the

178
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
administration side so what happened on

179
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,440
the bad actors side iran was actually

180
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,599
the most active from a disinformation

181
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,599
from a technical perspective

182
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
october 21st 22nd

183
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
you may recall that some

184
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
emails were sent to voters in florida

185
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,400
and elsewhere claiming to be the proud

186
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,919
boys saying hey we know who you

187
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,199
registered for

188
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,039
to vote for and if you don't change your

189
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,599
registration uh and if you don't vote

190
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,680
for the current president we're going to

191
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
come after you so this was an

192
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,080
intimidation operation and with it and

193
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,240
we were able to attribute that back to

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,639
the iranians in very short order that

195
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,400
was the foreign actors we also had

196
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,120
domestic actors so we may remember uh

197
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,400
the kraken the kraken was the name that

198
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
sydney powell one of the former

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,680
president's attorneys

200
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,039
put on her uh on her uh overarching

201
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
operation to claim that there was

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
foreign interference in the election

203
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,880
that that there was a dead venezuelan

204
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,919
dictator from the grave hugo chavez

205
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,479
reaching into systems tabulators and

206
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,560
changing votes waiting votes differently

207
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,919
for different

208
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,240
candidates and flipping votes at night

209
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
i want to point back to the

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
verifiability of the paper ballots

211
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,599
and

212
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
saw the concept of software independence

213
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,039
in

214
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,800
elections where

215
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
a soft piece of software or hardware

216
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,879
cannot be a single point of failure so

217
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,440
georgia counted again three times each

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,280
time the vote was consistent with the

219
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,039
prior

220
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,680
all of this leads up to january 6. we

221
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,759
all know what happened in washington d.c

222
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,120
in the capitol and we've seen the

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
aftermath so that's the context this was

224
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
an escalation

225
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
starting the summer before with an

226
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
anticipation of a rigged election that

227
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240
ran through november 3rd through january

228
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
6 and it continues to this day

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
so what went right

230
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
yes things actually went well in the

231
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,479
2020 election first the level of

232
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,559
cooperation and coordination at all

233
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,479
levels of government literally

234
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,240
dhs in 2016 in that election did not

235
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
have the relationships and frankly

236
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,519
understanding of how

237
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,440
elections were administered so working

238
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
with the range of folks including as as

239
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,200
i mentioned bob lord when he was at the

240
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
dnc

241
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,560
working with a range of partners to

242
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,040
build an operational relationship from a

243
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
cyber security perspective we

244
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,240
established a dedicated isac in 2018 all

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,800
50 states participated in that ice act

246
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,279
provided

247
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,279
exercises training scans jack cable

248
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,279
who some of you all may know developed a

249
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,760
tool called crossfeed which provided

250
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,839
external scanning of network

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,440
infrastructure so we were able to give

252
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
them the tools and the resources to

253
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
improve uh the security at all levels

254
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
and that's not just at the state and

255
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
local level

256
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
cyber command in the intelligence

257
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,000
community also had dedicated operations

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
ann newberger who is now the deputy

259
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
national security advisor in the white

260
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,880
house was in charge of the russia small

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,200
group in the run up to 2018 was a key

262
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
player in the election security group

263
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,680
for for 2020. so you really did see a

264
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,600
dedicated effort in the federal

265
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
government to protect the 2020 election

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,839
also we saw lessons learned from the

267
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,560
primaries applied towards the general

268
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
election

269
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,720
and an improvement in the efficacy of

270
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,560
their processes so you heard a lot about

271
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,600
lines

272
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,399
in

273
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,279
uh the the generals or i'm sorry in the

274
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,560
primaries by the time you got to the

275
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,720
general election there were the lines uh

276
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,200
had dissipated for the most part in most

277
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,720
states including georgia which is the

278
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,640
one that got most of the attention

279
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,399
uh the the platform social media

280
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
platforms they don't get a lot of credit

281
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,079
but they actually do deserve some credit

282
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,000
for dedicating resources building

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,440
massive teams

284
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,200
to address particularly the foreign

285
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
interference piece

286
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
but they did have

287
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,240
in general

288
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,839
a number of different policies in place

289
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,160
for election related disinformation it

290
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,800
wasn't always 100 effective as as we'll

291
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
talk about in a second

292
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,720
already talked about the ballots but

293
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,839
that key point of the verifiability and

294
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
auditability gave us the confidence

295
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,640
across the election administration space

296
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
in the federal government and the state

297
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,720
locals where we we did in fact know that

298
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,279
this was a secure election that they

299
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,200
were they went back and they counted we

300
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,800
knew the resources that we'd stacked

301
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,480
against it and we knew the activity we

302
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
saw across the various uh jurisdictions

303
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,120
to lead to that that conclusion

304
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,000
media coverage media had a much more

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,760
disciplined approach to disinformation

306
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,680
that was provided than in the 2016

307
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,839
election and we didn't see as much of

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
the crazy uh reporting talked about iran

309
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,120
the disinformation attribution

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
mechanisms that we put in place 27 hours

311
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,440
from the first detection of those proud

312
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,000
boy emails to publicly calling out iran

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,560
27 hours that typically took months

314
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,240
previous to that again it shows when you

315
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
put a dedicated effort against a problem

316
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,040
set you can move very very quickly in

317
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,839
with a great deal of of lethality

318
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,440
and then lastly

319
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
you have to talk about the academic and

320
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,839
the state level partnership so stanford

321
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,440
internet observatory university of

322
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
washington center for informed public

323
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
in the election integrity partnership it

324
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,120
was a key partner in identifying

325
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,079
disinformation themes and providing

326
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,240
both debunking and pre-bunking which

327
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,399
then flowed into the rumor control

328
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,560
uh platform that we established at cisa

329
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
right around the time of the iranian

330
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,720
effort and then lastly same sort of

331
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,639
thing trusted information getting more

332
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,399
information out there from state and

333
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,600
locals

334
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,519
as the as the the authoritative source

335
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
so what went wrong

336
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,920
well a symmetry of disinformation the

337
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,639
flood of lies it got to the point where

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,760
we as defenders because it takes time to

339
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,560
establish the case

340
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,720
we were overwhelmed we were simply

341
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
overwhelmed by

342
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,120
social media we were overwhelmed by

343
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
traditional news outlets that in some

344
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,279
cases were

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,560
promoting

346
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,440
information from elites from influencers

347
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,399
it

348
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,040
it simply doesn't match right when

349
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,720
you've got someone like me that had 10

350
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
000 followers on twitter and the former

351
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,760
president who was

352
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,279
promoting some of the theories that had

353
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,760
close to 80 million uh it's it's you

354
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,920
know i'm bringing a butter knife to a

355
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
howitzer fight

356
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,760
lack of general understanding of

357
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,160
elections and the changes that happened

358
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,560
through the 2020 election that was the

359
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,480
most fertile ground

360
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
ultimately for disinformation most of

361
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,839
you have probably heard about

362
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,240
sharpiegate so sharpiegate was in

363
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,720
arizona where uh voters were issued

364
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,320
ballots and with sharpies and the

365
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,399
sharpies did in fact bleed through but

366
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,000
on the other side of the ballot there

367
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,279
was no readable or scannable section and

368
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,240
yet

369
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
when the when the voters went home and

370
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,720
they talked about it it built up into a

371
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,800
bigger narrative which then leads me to

372
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,440
one of i think the more important uh

373
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,760
analysis and research pieces out of the

374
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,320
the last year so kate starboard from

375
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,680
university of washington who had the

376
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
pleasure to work with on the aspen

377
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,040
institute's commission on information

378
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,160
disorder talked about

379
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,920
participatory disinformation where there

380
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
are three groups of agents we had the

381
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,120
elites

382
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
the influencers and the audience so the

383
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,959
elites had been establishing the case

384
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,959
for months if not years that it would be

385
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
in fact a rigged election

386
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,720
and if you don't understand how anything

387
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,120
works everything looks like conspiracy

388
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,800
or conspiracy theory so when the

389
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,040
audience saw things as they went out and

390
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,519
voted like sharpie gate they would start

391
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,680
bubbling that up and then you have the

392
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
blue check marks and influencers who

393
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
grab on to those conspiracy theories

394
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,120
and then amplify

395
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
and that all then gets

396
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
further agitated by the elites and so

397
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,440
there's a model

398
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
that has now led i think to where we are

399
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,279
where we've lost control of the ability

400
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,800
to control some of the the

401
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440
disinformation theories because of that

402
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,480
virtuous and vicious cycle

403
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
part of that was also some a b testing i

404
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
think if you go back and you look at the

405
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,880
2020 election and the most

406
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,240
pernicious disinformation themes it was

407
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
not the foreign interference it was not

408
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,120
the fantastical and fanciful dead

409
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,079
venezuelan dictators or chinese hackers

410
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,079
coming in through thermostats if you if

411
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,920
you think about the p caps that were

412
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,839
claimed by mike lindell at his cyber

413
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,240
symposium that were thoroughly debunked

414
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,560
by the likes of rob graham and even josh

415
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,920
merritt

416
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,480
those didn't catch on because they were

417
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,120
too technically hard to understand and

418
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,399
the elites

419
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,920
could not promote them the

420
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,680
disinformation themes where there's a

421
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,959
rigged game where there's fraud those

422
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,040
were more successful so my take going

423
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
forward in that 2020 a b testing what

424
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
you'll see in 24 and beyond is more

425
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,519
domestic focused disinformation rather

426
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,600
than the foreign disinformation piece

427
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,399
and that is where we landed ultimately

428
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,440
with 2020. the caller was inside the

429
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,639
house

430
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,480
and so we now have a domestic

431
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
disinformation

432
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
problem that is leading up to

433
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,120
a very significant national security

434
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,000
threat

435
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,759
for the the continuation of the american

436
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,360
democracy

437
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,519
so how do we improve uh there's no

438
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,680
single bullet a silver bullet here you

439
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
know we're not just going to turn a

440
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,199
switch and fix these things

441
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,120
first and foremost we have to continue

442
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,839
to invest in american elections we have

443
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,920
to give election administrators the

444
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,480
resources to him to continue to

445
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,079
modernize systems to increase uh

446
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,880
auditability and as well as the actual

447
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,759
auditing of elections post-election

448
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,240
pre-certification not a year and a half

449
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,600
after by uh you know on at least paper

450
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,959
unqualified

451
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,320
auditors

452
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,639
we actually have to continue to invest

453
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,360
in

454
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,759
the election administration workforce in

455
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,800
the run up to 2020 and since then due to

456
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,399
the continued the brigading against

457
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,440
election officials we've had a dramatic

458
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,000
increase in retirements of election

459
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,320
officials people that get threats at

460
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,800
their home i got doxed by a former

461
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,959
administration official on sunday

462
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,240
my gmail is a is a mess right now so

463
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,480
this just happened to me it's happening

464
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
to thousands and thousands of election

465
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,640
officials across the country al schmidt

466
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,839
a republican in philadelphia retired and

467
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,839
he had people come to his house you hear

468
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,240
about jocelyn benson uh with armed

469
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,919
people showing up at her house with her

470
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,480
kids at home uh up in up in michigan so

471
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,280
this is a significant problem and we we

472
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
need to bolster this workforce give them

473
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,200
the resources to protect themselves and

474
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
law enforcement needs to take these

475
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,960
threats seriously

476
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,160
the other way i think we got to move

477
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
forward is we have to improve the

478
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,919
understanding of how our elections work

479
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,240
i think the average voter thinks that

480
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,160
however they vote whether they drop it

481
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,559
in the in the mail or in a

482
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,720
a drop-off box or they vote on election

483
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,200
day they think that's it and you know

484
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,679
they turn on the tv and their their news

485
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,960
channel of choice uh reports out the the

486
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,360
outcome that evening that is not how

487
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
elections work there are months of

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,679
preparation november third was the last

489
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,200
day to vote it wasn't necessarily

490
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
election day it was the last day to vote

491
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,960
there were plenty of opportunities

492
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,720
before what happens after election day

493
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
canvassing auditing the certification

494
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
process leading up to

495
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
the no the december safe harbor that

496
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
then leads up to the elect seating of

497
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,480
the electoral college in january

498
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,000
we have to improve civic engagement with

499
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,480
american elections part of that we also

500
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,400
need the u.s government to take

501
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,360
disinformation particularly as it

502
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,000
relates to democracy public health and

503
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,919
marginalized communities take it

504
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,240
seriously we need a strategic federal

505
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
approach plenty of other governments

506
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,799
canada australia norway france

507
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,120
among others have established

508
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
disinformation focused operations i'm

509
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,280
not saying that the federal government

510
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,000
is the arbiter of truth

511
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
the federal government needs to

512
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
understand though that the

513
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,640
disinformation is a threat to democracy

514
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,000
some of the other things we reviewed in

515
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,440
the aspen institute include

516
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,600
accountability norms where whether it's

517
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,559
lawyers doctors business leaders who

518
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,559
continue to raid out by edelman and

519
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,080
others as the most trusted voices in

520
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,280
in america they need to

521
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,840
engage in the national conversation on

522
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,720
what's acceptable and then platforms

523
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,480
they've improved but we still need

524
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,160
improved transparency i'm not going to

525
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,640
wade into the section 230 conversation

526
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,120
in my remaining 11 seconds

527
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,679
but the last piece here is we got to

528
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
make a decision do we want to continue

529
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,559
to be a democracy

530
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,039
it takes work it takes effort it takes

531
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,360
time takes commitment it takes everyone

532
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,640
in this room

533
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,799
to also be a part of the conversation

534
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
so that got a few minutes here i think

535
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,520
for some questions
