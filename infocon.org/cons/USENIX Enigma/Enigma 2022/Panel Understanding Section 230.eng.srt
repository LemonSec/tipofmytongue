1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,280
all right uh thank you very much uh

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,519
thanks to all the the organizers and for

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,600
everyone for having us uh this is as

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,760
mentioned a really really important and

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,560
yet very often misunderstood

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,240
uh topic it's uh misunderstood somewhat

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560
frequently including a whole bunch this

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,238
very week uh i know that all of us on

9
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,840
the panel had really hoped to be there

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,320
in person as well but for a variety of

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,120
reasons uh it ended up that none of us

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440
could make it so i appreciate that we

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
were able to to

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
do this virtually but but we certainly

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,640
miss uh being there and getting to see

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,039
everybody uh and interact with everyone

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,520
in the audience so for this panel we

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
have you know honestly three of the best

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,559
experts uh that i could think of from

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
from somewhat different perspectives uh

21
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,159
to talk about section 230 and when i say

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,560
uh different perspectives often on

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,479
panels the way they they're set up is

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,080
that uh you get you know people who have

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,799
uh disagreeing views and the the the

26
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,720
point of the panel is to to set them up

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,799
to sort of argue with each other that's

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,320
not what we're going to do today because

29
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,680
i actually don't find that to be

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,720
particularly insightful or useful in in

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,799
any real way but i think what we have

32
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,720
here are three people who have different

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
perspectives in the traditional sense of

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,320
different perspectives which is they're

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,079
looking at it from from different views

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,759
and therefore they can help provide

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,040
those different perspectives in a way

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
that i think will be really really

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,000
useful um the bios of all three uh you

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
can look up and read but i'm going to

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,240
give you sort of a shorthand version of

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,439
of who our our three panelists are uh so

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,040
you can get a sense of of where that

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,759
perspective is coming from uh we have

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,079
cathy gelles who is a lawyer who helps

46
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,079
explain the law to people so that they

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,560
can understand it and not uh mess it up

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
hopefully we have kate clonic who is the

49
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,119
law professor who has spent probably

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,280
more time than anyone else understanding

51
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,440
how the law interacts with content

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,599
moderation and how the companies uh

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,920
engage on that and then we have adeline

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,959
psy who has spent years working in

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,959
various companies in a variety of

56
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,720
different trust and safety roles and

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,520
understands the trust and safety process

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
and the the way that companies work on

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
these issues and how

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,959
you know 230 impacts how how companies

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:31,840
uh

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,440
handle different questions around

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,519
content moderation so we get these sort

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,920
of three important different views

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
for the panel i'm going to start out

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
with uh going to kathy uh and asking her

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
to sort of give the the quick summary of

68
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
what is section 230 uh you know in the

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,120
most basic sense you know what does it

70
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,519
say and what does it actually mean and

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,879
then we'll bring in the other panelists

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,959
so so kathy you want to

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,080
get started

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,200
okay

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,720
um thanks mike

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
yeah actually i want to sneak in the

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,720
comment that what is the one thing i

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,280
want everyone to know about section 230

79
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,680
and that is that it's not what's broken

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
it's one of our best defenses against

81
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,519
what's broken and we mess with it at our

82
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,480
peril

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,920
and to understand this we need to

84
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
understand sort of the world that we

85
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
were in before we had section 230 which

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
um was a changing world get in your time

87
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,200
machine go back to the mid 90s when

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
a couple things are happening one of the

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,440
things that are happening is that

90
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,959
online systems are getting really

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,959
popular they're starting to enter the

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
mainstream leaving academia um some of

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
them weren't actually the internet

94
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
themselves some of them were walled

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,120
gardens like prodigy america online

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,640
compuserve

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,319
eventually they started to touch the

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,000
world wide web which was also becoming

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,159
popular but things are starting to

100
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,720
happen in a variety of online contexts

101
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,920
um this also caused some people in

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
congress to worry about oh my gosh you

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
know some people in congress were like

104
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,879
this is really cool

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,400
what a nice thing that we can have with

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,319
the internet and some people were like

107
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,680
oh my gosh this means we're going to

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,599
have porn and i realize that this is not

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,959
the technical term that we're going to

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,560
have but this was a moral panic they

111
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
were not interested in the technical

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
term so you have some people like shut

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,239
this down and some people were like

114
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,920
bring it on and so you had this

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
collision of tensions and then you had

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,918
this really horrible lawsuit that

117
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
happened in a state court in new york

118
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,199
called um

119
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,840
strata nope versus prodigy where a

120
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
prodigy user had allegedly defamed

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
somebody and then that somebody decided

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,160
to sue prodigy for taking they should be

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
liable for the terrible things their

124
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,759
their users are saying

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
and the problem was that a

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,919
a judge looked in and said yep that

127
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,240
sounds good to me which would open the

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
door to obliterating every online

129
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,800
service because online services

130
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
have an awful lot of content even back

131
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
then they had tens of thousands of users

132
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
tens of thousands of content happening

133
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,639
across its systems monthly like how

134
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,040
could you possibly

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
be responsible for that you wouldn't

136
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,639
know what was there how could you police

137
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,160
it so all of a sudden it's like if

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
you're in business

139
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,759
hosting and facilitating user generated

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,080
content your business is in big trouble

141
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,199
because

142
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,720
part of the problem is

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
there's certain defenses like the first

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
amendment and we'll talk more about that

145
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
over the course of this panel that the

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,919
first amendment would provide an awful

147
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,600
lot of protection for things that

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,160
platforms do in hosting content or

149
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,919
taking content down

150
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,520
but what good is the first amendment if

151
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,960
you have to go to court to defend that

152
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,759
right

153
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,800
so

154
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,960
you're looking at a situation where

155
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,039
anybody who's helping like that because

156
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
the internet is a system of helpers you

157
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,960
need somebody to help you get your idea

158
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,919
from point a to point b like this panel

159
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,759
we're not just talking about section 230

160
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,000
we're demonstrating section 230 because

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,479
i'm sitting here very far from you and

162
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,960
getting my ideas from my head to your

163
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,199
ears via an awful lot of helpers we've

164
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,280
got my isp we've got zoom we've got

165
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
other isps backbones you need these

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,039
helpers or else the internet does not

167
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,759
work and these ideas do not get shared

168
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,240
so you have to make it possible that a a

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,039
platform a service a helper can't get

170
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,440
shut down by the threat of lawsuits

171
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
um we want also

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,199
a second thing for platforms to do

173
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,479
because one of the things that was a

174
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,039
problem for prodigy is and that kind of

175
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
caused the court to say yes totally fine

176
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
to have you be liable is that prodigy

177
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,880
actually was trying to take care of its

178
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,759
community they actually said we try to

179
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
monitor content they obviously couldn't

180
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,919
do a perfect job we will talk more about

181
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,759
why it's not possible to do a perfect

182
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,600
job at that scale but they wanted to

183
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,440
give it a shot

184
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,600
and what we're going to say no to that

185
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
like no no if you're going to be in

186
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
business of helping content you have to

187
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,479
be totally different than hands off and

188
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,720
like whatever crap happens you got to

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
let it happen because otherwise you

190
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,039
won't be able to help any expression

191
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,199
like this doesn't make sense

192
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,080
so

193
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,319
a couple of members of congress then um

194
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
now senator ron wyden congress then

195
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
congressman chris who has been a

196
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,840
representative and also chris cox as a

197
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,280
representative are like this is not a

198
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,680
good situation we want platforms to do

199
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
two things we want them to be partners

200
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,400
with congress's goal to get the most

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
good stuff online diversity of

202
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
expression ideas services e-commerce all

203
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
sorts of stuff

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,840
and

205
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,800
minimize the

206
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
most of the worst

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,120
and um what they realize is that okay

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,919
the way to do that is a carrot-based law

209
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,000
rather than a thou shalt not stick based

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,039
law

211
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,039
um so you incentivize them to do the

212
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,039
best they can on both fronts by making

213
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,440
it legally safe for them to do the best

214
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,680
they can on both fronts and that led to

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
section 230 which is a two-pronged

216
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,240
immunity that basically says

217
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,280
you are

218
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
well we'll talk

219
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,479
let's get to the specifics of what it

220
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,960
does because

221
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
the two things are you're safe if you

222
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,039
leave content up and you're safe if you

223
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,360
leave content down and they do this by

224
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,000
basically with what is now called the 26

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,199
words that created the internet um

226
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,879
i'll read them to you but i've never

227
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,520
managed to recite them in a way that is

228
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
ever understandable so i'll translate as

229
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,360
soon as i recite it but

230
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,759
no provider or user of an interactive

231
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,840
computer service shall be treated as the

232
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
publisher or speaker of any information

233
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,000
provided by another information content

234
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,440
provider

235
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
what that means is whoever was the user

236
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,879
who

237
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
created the user generated content

238
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,960
expressed the user generated content

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,639
you know whoever made the mess is

240
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
responsible for the mess but not the

241
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
helper not that platform not that

242
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,679
service not the facilitator that helped

243
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,559
the expression happen online and that is

244
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,159
key now there's also a second immunity

245
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,958
which explicitly goes towards moderation

246
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,040
practices and it's pretty broad because

247
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
although it talks about yes we want you

248
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,760
to get rid of

249
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
certain types of

250
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,440
undesirable content it also has language

251
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,399
otherwise

252
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,279
objectionable which is

253
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
a broad brush that platforms can use

254
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,519
lots of judgment for also the first

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,360
amendment allows platforms to exercise

256
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,040
lots of judgment but again what's the

257
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
point of the first amendment if those

258
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,959
rights are going to lead you dry and

259
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
legal costs having to go to court to

260
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,600
assert that discretion so they put

261
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,560
something explicitly into section 230.

262
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
it turns out that over the last 20 some

263
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,880
odd years it's been um

264
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,959
that first bit the first 26 words that

265
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,560
have actually done a lot of the heavy

266
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,720
lifting even for moderation decisions

267
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,519
but basically the idea is that you have

268
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,200
these first amendment rights and we want

269
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,360
to encourage you to use them to leave up

270
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
the most good content take down the most

271
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
bad content and this is what they

272
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
crafted this is the statute it got

273
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
tucked into the communications decency

274
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
act because congress was really worried

275
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
overall like all of congress not just

276
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,360
these congressmen the people who were

277
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
afraid of the porn really cared about

278
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,120
internet hygiene so they passed the

279
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,680
communications decency act most of it

280
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,000
was struck down by a case called aclu

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,440
versus reno um which made the very

282
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,000
important point back then that um the

283
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,720
first amendment does indeed apply online

284
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
um but the piece that was left standing

285
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
is section 230 and as people have said

286
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,839
it is the um 26 words that have created

287
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,920
the internet and allowed everything to

288
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,160
happen that is good bad or otherwise and

289
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
so the rest of it as we'll talk about

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
what can we do about the otherwise um

291
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,240
without actually ruining this because if

292
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
you start poking holes in it

293
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,120
you you it's kind of a balloon it's not

294
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,279
going to hold together you one poke and

295
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,959
you kind of lose all of its strength and

296
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,839
value so let's not do

297
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,480
that

298
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,959
all right so uh kate i'm gonna go to you

299
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
next uh i think you more than probably

300
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
anyone else has really gone into the

301
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,240
history of you know how how the

302
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,640
different companies have moderated and

303
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
how they sort of you know

304
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,560
as the internet grew they sort of

305
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,399
learned you know

306
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,440
both

307
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
why section 230 was important to them

308
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
and sort of how

309
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,160
they could moderate so do you want to

310
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
talk a little bit kind of of the i guess

311
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,600
the evolution of content moderation uh

312
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
you know on the internet thanks to

313
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
section 230 for the most part yeah of

314
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,600
course um so kathy great um lead in as

315
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
as always um i i will kind of start with

316
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,440
the idea that as kathy mentioned there

317
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,399
is this carrot kind of for um for

318
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,480
private companies to begin moderating

319
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
where the government can't to take down

320
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
kind of the parts of the internet that

321
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,760
we

322
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,560
don't want in certain places um

323
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,519
but without the kind of sensorial regime

324
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,360
of of the government

325
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,160
um and so what you kind of have starting

326
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,279
in 2004 and what i looked into um in the

327
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,040
last what i've basically started for the

328
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,959
last six years is how like major

329
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,760
companies that host user generated

330
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,839
content um

331
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,560
primarily ones that engage in what we

332
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,639
would call cons commercial content

333
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,560
moderation which is that they pay other

334
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,519
people

335
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,440
to um to review flagged content

336
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,120
that might be against their terms of

337
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
service basically how they put that

338
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,399
regime together how they started

339
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,200
establishing rules how they began to

340
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,760
judge content against those rules how

341
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
they did that for a global audience how

342
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
they did that at scale when they went

343
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,440
from when facebook for example went from

344
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
2004 to like basically totally global in

345
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
2008 out of kind of the college

346
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,760
college-age student american-based

347
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,079
approach and went into kind of opening

348
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,040
up to all ages and all over the world

349
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,000
how that basically ended up changing um

350
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,920
the process of

351
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,240
the rules and how they got updated and

352
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,399
how they got applied um i want to kind

353
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,800
of contrast that briefly with what i

354
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,079
would call other types of non-commercial

355
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,880
user generated content moderation that's

356
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,120
like your reddit your wikipedia that's

357
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
volunteers essentially who are users on

358
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,800
the site and the site rewards them and

359
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,680
empowers them to basically be moderators

360
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
for subreddits or various small

361
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
communities it is how a lot of content

362
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
moderation is done it is a slightly

363
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
different thing and it is not

364
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,160
specifically what i

365
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
studied because it is a little bit more

366
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,040
decentralized and was harder to study so

367
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,800
what i kind of focused on was what are

368
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
these big actors twitter youtube

369
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,959
facebook like what were they basically

370
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,519
doing and what i uncovered at least um

371
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,680
and the most information that i was able

372
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,160
to to glean although um

373
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
this was like largely true for all of

374
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,480
the platforms um but for specific dates

375
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,079
i'll just stick with facebook was that

376
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,360
around like 2008 um there was a group of

377
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,639
college-aged recent college grads in

378
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,760
menlo park basically adjudicated doing

379
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,800
adjudication on content with this you

380
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
know this normative base of like if it

381
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
makes you feel bad take it down take

382
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
down hitler take down nazis take down

383
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,959
swastikas

384
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,000
um you know take down revenge porn if

385
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,600
like they can you know you can show it

386
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,399
all of these types of these things

387
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,440
that quickly became an untenable

388
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,800
standard um just like if you had a small

389
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,399
town and you could tell

390
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,040
10 people don't drive too fast and that

391
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
was a perfectly administerable rule when

392
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
there's only 10 people and everyone kind

393
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
of knows what that means but when you

394
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
have like 10 000 people you need to set

395
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,959
a speed limit you need to have rules and

396
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,639
you need to be able to make exceptions

397
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,040
to the rules and to figure out when you

398
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
know you're going to allow someone to go

399
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,639
slightly over the speed limit if they're

400
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
trying to get to the hospital or you

401
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,040
know but not when they're driving drunk

402
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,920
um so those types of exceptions end up

403
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,079
being kind of called out and

404
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,160
i basically what i found was that

405
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,399
facebook had developed essentially kind

406
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,320
of what is almost like a common law type

407
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
system which was that they had had these

408
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,519
rules and then they were constantly

409
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:51,680
reevaluating them um as facts and kind

410
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,360
of other things came into play and

411
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,959
making exceptions and so there are some

412
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,040
ones that are very famous now one of

413
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,160
them is like there was no they had a a

414
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,240
bar against um topless nudity for women

415
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,480
on the site then they had to make people

416
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
were very upset with this because they

417
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,079
wanted to post intimate photos of

418
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,240
breastfeeding their child or things like

419
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
that but then they had to try to figure

420
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,279
out how to define a child um and then

421
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,040
they had to figure figure out how they

422
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,639
were going to define actively

423
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
breastfeeding which is like or like the

424
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,720
five minutes after breastfeeding while

425
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
the child falls asleep all of these

426
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
types of things that had to be basically

427
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,759
it critically define the norms that are

428
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,759
very amorphous and subjective

429
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
basically translating them into these

430
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,959
objective means of looking at content

431
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,279
and then doing that across very

432
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,720
different um norms of intuitions between

433
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,560
the people who are posting these photos

434
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
and having them reported and the people

435
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,600
who are adjudicating them in the

436
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,079
philippines or india or warsaw or

437
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,320
wherever they were

438
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
something that you couldn't rely on at

439
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
all anymore was this

440
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
very normative very subjective idea of

441
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,800
if it makes me feel bad take it down if

442
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,160
it's sexually explicit take it down that

443
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
turned out to be a very different

444
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
judgment and hyderabad than it was in

445
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,680
new york city or even nashville

446
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,079
tennessee or anywhere else that you were

447
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,680
kind of adjudicating this type of

448
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,759
content so facebook had one set of rules

449
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,079
and was trying to enforce them globally

450
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,639
under the auspices that there was

451
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,920
like with the with the kind of the

452
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,440
language that this was one global

453
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
community even though we all kind of

454
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,120
know that there's no way that there is

455
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,199
one global community that is that we can

456
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,040
all agree on what the norms are for

457
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
different types of content so that was

458
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,519
primarily what i what i what i've

459
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,440
studied and what i continue to study and

460
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,639
the norms around this are just

461
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,720
constantly changing like and so are the

462
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
rules that these sites enforce and how

463
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,880
they enforce them

464
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,399
one of the big changes you've seen in

465
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,680
the last couple of years is around

466
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,320
disinformation or misinformation you've

467
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,519
seen changes in how they treat public

468
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,759
figures and political figures how they

469
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,880
define

470
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,760
those people for purposes of like if you

471
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
have an involuntary figure that suddenly

472
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,480
gets bullied versus you have kind of a

473
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,880
public figure that is a political figure

474
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,319
like donald trump

475
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,280
all of these various types of of

476
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
different kind of changes to these rules

477
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,839
and how they're constantly uh going and

478
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,640
those do happen within the within the

479
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,000
realm of 230. i typically talk about 230

480
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,360
now in my work

481
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,080
in the sense that for these giant

482
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,120
players

483
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,679
facebook twitter and youtube in

484
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,120
particular

485
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,880
that section 230 doesn't have

486
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
the there there that it used to have the

487
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,360
idea was to create this kind of

488
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,080
incubation and this kind of process

489
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
and encouraging kind of good content

490
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,400
moderation it is really not clear um

491
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
how many like how much

492
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,160
changing section 230 would really hurt

493
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
uh facebook's bottom line anymore or

494
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
make a huge difference just because

495
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
these suits and the impact of them would

496
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
probably be small and defamation and

497
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
other types of communications chords are

498
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,799
still very hard to prove um across kind

499
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,120
of uh to across 230 uh even sorry even

500
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
without 230 uh

501
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,799
nevertheless i think that like the

502
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,520
politicization of it has muddied kind of

503
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,240
the very essential nature of what what

504
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,960
the law is and kind of overcomplicated

505
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
something that i think is

506
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,559
fairly uh fairly straightforward so um i

507
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,120
that's kind of that's where i will leave

508
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,400
it

509
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,679
great uh thanks and and uh i think i'll

510
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,280
i want to get back to some of what you

511
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
said but uh let's let's move on to

512
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,120
adeline for uh

513
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,919
next

514
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,840
just because you were actually working

515
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
in these companies many of these

516
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,000
companies uh as a lot of this was was

517
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
being put into practice and and sort of

518
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,559
you know saw from the inside how

519
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,559
companies dealt with these questions and

520
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,720
and you know create in some cases you

521
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,799
know created trust and safety

522
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,559
um efforts and and and organizations um

523
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,400
so can you talk a little bit about you

524
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,000
know sort of that that view from the

525
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,559
inside um you know that kate sort of

526
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,480
mentioned some of some of the thinking

527
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
but i would love to hear your take on

528
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,720
what what it really was like on the

529
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,919
inside and how you were thinking through

530
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,000
these things and you know the potential

531
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,320
risks and liabilities as it relates to

532
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,520
230.

533
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,080
yeah so it was funny i was actually um

534
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,559
when i was asked to be on this panel i

535
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,400
was kind of like well i'm actually not

536
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,120
an expert on 230 or the law right like i

537
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,360
don't have a background in the law um

538
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,640
and when i started doing this work um

539
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,559
you know um

540
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,720
as a as a person working on advertising

541
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,080
policy the idea of section 230 was never

542
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
kind of at the forefront of my daily

543
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,720
operational work right so i think there

544
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
is sort of this level there are kind of

545
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
two levels of abstraction really

546
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,840
um you know you have 230 the law which

547
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,840
is creating a context for the tech

548
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,039
companies and then you have these teams

549
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,640
within the tech companies that are

550
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,039
trying to create rules about what's

551
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,919
acceptable or not acceptable in order to

552
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,760
sort of align themselves with section

553
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,280
230 and not get into trouble with

554
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,360
section 230 or kind of lose their

555
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,559
immunity

556
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
and then there's another level of

557
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,679
abstraction when you go from the content

558
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,360
policies themselves which are the rules

559
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,159
of what you know can or can't stay um

560
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,960
online to the operations folks and so i

561
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,440
would say like you know as a front line

562
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
reviewer you're not thinking about

563
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,000
section 230 on a day-to-day basis so

564
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,240
that was kind of my entry into

565
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,559
um trust and safety doing kind of

566
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,760
reviews on pages to see if they were you

567
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
know scammy or if they were kind of

568
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,600
problematic for users

569
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
and then i started moving a lot more

570
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,559
into the content creation space and even

571
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,120
at the beginning um i would say like and

572
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,159
you know i'm just kind of like drawing

573
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,240
on my own experience um

574
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,000
you know personally for me like i didn't

575
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,559
feel like i got a ton of context around

576
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,559
section 230 when i first started out

577
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,000
right so a lot of the work that i was

578
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,080
doing was around hey like who do we want

579
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
to be as a company like what are our

580
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,480
principles what are our standards like

581
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,280
what's um you know what are we doing to

582
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,159
prevent abuse of our users

583
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,080
um and what can we do to just make this

584
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,159
environment a lot safer so that you know

585
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,000
and for you know very

586
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,480
um you know idealistic reasons that

587
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,400
existed at the time at the places that i

588
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
worked at but also very pragmatic

589
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,600
reasons like

590
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,840
users need a place right

591
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,440
for them to feel safe and then we can

592
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,200
actually grow the platform

593
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,280
i have to say like the the places that

594
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
i've i've worked at um really

595
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,880
prioritized

596
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,799
concepts like freedom of expression and

597
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,400
so that kind of um you know um

598
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,720
idealistic space contributes to a lot of

599
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,679
policies that meant that we were

600
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,919
usually inclined to leave more content

601
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,480
up and fight against requests to take

602
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,039
stuff down um but there are plenty of

603
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,480
other companies where there are teams

604
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,320
that don't value that

605
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,760
as a principal and we can talk about

606
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,440
various companies where they sit on

607
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,440
different ends of the spectrum and for

608
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
them um you know they're going to create

609
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
policies that are more likely to say

610
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,559
like hey like we don't want to fight

611
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,760
this

612
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
um particular issue

613
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
and we don't like any sexual content at

614
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
all on our platform because that's not

615
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,480
what we're about and we're just going to

616
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
take that down and so i think you know

617
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,120
the fact that there are so many

618
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,159
um different um you know organizations

619
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,320
and companies that have different um

620
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
principles around and and missions

621
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,640
around like who they want to be kind of

622
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,520
also muddies the section 230

623
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,600
conversation i think when you start

624
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,080
looking at the at the law but just in

625
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,760
terms of like my own personal experience

626
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
like that's um

627
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,159
the

628
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,280
idea that you know these um um company

629
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,440
operators would be thinking about 2 30

630
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,039
every day like that's not a reality

631
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,720
right like our lawyers think about it

632
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,960
our legal teams think about it but um at

633
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,799
the trust and safety policy level and

634
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,039
operations level that's not something we

635
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,960
wake up you know thinking about and go

636
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,080
to sleep kind of worrying about um right

637
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,600
so i i don't know if that's helpful but

638
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,919
i'm happy to kind of do more follow-up

639
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,080
questions on that yeah i actually think

640
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,440
that's really helpful and actually in

641
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,919
some ways i think that is is a really

642
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,600
important point and it's actually a

643
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,400
feature of section 230 that the the

644
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,919
front line trust and safety people don't

645
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,440
need to be thinking about it right

646
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,320
because you have other laws that are

647
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
in some way structurally similar to

648
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,720
section 230 like the dmca for for

649
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,280
copyright issues and in that case

650
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
specific decisions that you make

651
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
can impact the liability of the company

652
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,760
so when it comes to copyright um you

653
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,440
know the frontline trust and safety team

654
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,600
actually has to be very aware of the

655
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
different elements of of the dmca and

656
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,080
the law to to keep your safe harbors the

657
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,679
nice thing about section 230 is that

658
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,799
it's not like that where you have a sort

659
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,200
of safe harbor setup where you have to

660
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,679
like do this this and this to to keep

661
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,760
those protections but section 230 is

662
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
very broad and it allows

663
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,039
you and the teams that are doing the um

664
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,799
the trust and safety decisions to make

665
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,320
those decisions to say things like we

666
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,400
want a safe platform without thinking

667
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
about does that open us up to some kind

668
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
of liability if we miss something if we

669
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,600
make a mistake

670
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,760
which was the the the situation in the

671
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,159
stratton oakmont case that that kathy

672
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,039
discussed so um

673
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,960
you know

674
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,720
uh one of the things that that's been

675
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,799
sort of uh you know

676
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,640
sort of top of my mind for for a long

677
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,200
time now is that you know section 230 as

678
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,279
kathy described is this sort of very

679
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,039
straightforward thing the the key part

680
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,640
is 26 words and yet it is sort of so

681
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
often misunderstood so i want to get a

682
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,080
little bit at the the root of of why and

683
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,000
how it's misunderstood so kathy i'm

684
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,799
going to go to you and say like

685
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,799
can you explain like why

686
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,480
to the extent that you can

687
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
why is it why is it so complex and

688
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,960
confusing to people uh when when they're

689
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,760
thinking about 230. well okay so one of

690
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
the things is that when people think of

691
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
law they tend to think of law i think in

692
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,480
punitive terms thou shalt not

693
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,919
um and that's why i talk about it as

694
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,360
being a carrot-based law not a

695
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,440
stick-based law we're not used to

696
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,200
carrot-based laws

697
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
it turns out i think that's a really

698
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,760
effective tool for policy makers to use

699
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,360
and maybe we want to use them in other

700
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,000
contexts where

701
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,159
you actually get more of what you want

702
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,640
when you create the incentives for

703
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,720
people to do what you want more than if

704
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,200
you just scare them like to use an

705
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,919
example in the section 230 context like

706
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,159
you want the platforms to be able to use

707
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,279
their resources effectively

708
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,440
as effectively as they can but if they

709
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,120
have to worry about specific forms of

710
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,679
liability like for instance copyright it

711
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,760
warps their ability to make good

712
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,360
decisions overall because they're going

713
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,679
to have to allocate some resources to

714
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,279
dealing with the copyright question

715
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,200
whether it actually made sense to and

716
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,520
maybe it causes them to be a less good

717
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
less well-moderated platform

718
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,840
after all because the punitive nature is

719
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
dry is kind of usurping a lot of their

720
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,279
resources telling them how to spend it

721
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,360
even if it isn't quite the right way to

722
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,799
spend it overall

723
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,480
so one of the

724
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,679
answer that question like one of the

725
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,919
reasons people don't get it is because

726
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,159
this is not intuitive to us where we

727
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,520
throw this sort of thing into the

728
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
universe to get good regulate good

729
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,840
policy outcomes we're not used to it i

730
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
think we should get more used to it the

731
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,360
second thing is it has absolutely no

732
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,440
business being here but it's become a

733
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
political punching bag like nobody

734
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
should be thinking about section 230. i

735
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,960
don't even want to think about section

736
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,760
230 like we are wasting our time on this

737
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,919
and what it really is is a proxy that

738
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,880
like

739
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
it worked the internet is doing what it

740
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,720
was designed to do it is connecting

741
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,880
all these people seven billion of us can

742
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,559
actually be connected in all sorts of

743
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,640
really interesting dynamic ways and it

744
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,039
turns out that as a civilization this is

745
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,200
unprecedented and we're not very good at

746
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,880
it and some people kind of suck and they

747
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,480
use their ability to connect with other

748
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,039
people in really terrible ways

749
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
it's we've got some growing pains

750
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,559
legitimately like i don't want to gloss

751
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,720
over actual harms but i do want to point

752
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,200
out that like if

753
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
nine nine 99.9999 nine nine nine nine

754
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,039
percent of the internet is awesome

755
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,480
that also means that because there's so

756
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
much of it the the one little sliver of

757
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,799
percentage over in the corner is gonna

758
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,799
seem like an awful lot of stuff

759
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,000
but you don't wanna kill that other 999

760
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,399
of good stuff and we kind of are because

761
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,080
bad stuff is happening we're alarmed by

762
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,760
the bad stuff that's happening we want

763
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,360
to deal with the bad stuff that's

764
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,520
happening and we should but the math is

765
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,679
coming out where bad stuff is happening

766
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,080
on the internet section 230 has enabled

767
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
the internet therefore section 230 must

768
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,039
be bad and that's not the map that's not

769
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,440
the math other things could happen to

770
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
buttress it but right now it's the only

771
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,760
poor little law doing all the heavy

772
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,240
lifting to give us any internet at all

773
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,080
we really should be looking more closely

774
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,440
at what are the harms what are the

775
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,600
things going wrong and what can we do to

776
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,159
tailor regulatory solutions around those

777
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,159
things without taking out the bit that's

778
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,640
actually working for us so we shouldn't

779
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
be thinking about section 230 let's just

780
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,240
move on and move on to the next finals

781
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,200
uh

782
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,880
i don't know cater adeline have you had

783
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,960
any any other thoughts related to sort

784
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,480
of how come

785
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,200
that section 230 has become so prevalent

786
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,679
yeah i i think that there's also just

787
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,559
i'm

788
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,720
i think that i think it is political

789
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,919
because

790
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,760
the because basically there has been

791
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,640
both

792
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,200
i think a little bit over emphasis on

793
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,039
what section 230 did to create the

794
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,480
internet i mean it is like you know we

795
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,559
have jeff kosip's book the 26 words the

796
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,919
great internet is kathy kind of

797
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,440
referenced this is like

798
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,760
eff and a lot of other kind of actors

799
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,520
have long lauded it and protected it

800
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,000
there have been there you know it became

801
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,880
kind of a bastion of um a lot of people

802
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,000
saying that like but for section 230 the

803
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,320
internet wouldn't have like the end we

804
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,240
wouldn't have the internet like it is

805
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,200
today and so uh like as cathy said that

806
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,360
is both bad and good and different days

807
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,120
and depending on kind of what site

808
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,880
you're on and what you're looking at and

809
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,919
so i think that basically when around

810
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,600
2016 2018 with which i would labor to

811
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,159
point out was just four years ago there

812
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,880
started to become this massive backlash

813
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,520
against big tech and against facebook

814
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,480
and we had

815
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,559
mark zuckerberg testify in congress for

816
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,399
the very first time and

817
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,240
you know congress people asking him to

818
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,159
fix their email and like it was just a

819
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,440
giant like disaster um but like there

820
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,159
has been um there has been only in the

821
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,679
last four years basically has the power

822
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,440
has the fact that i i would say that

823
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,799
only last four years have people

824
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,440
basically become aware that websites are

825
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,760
capable of this type of censorship or

826
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,600
this type of content and that they do it

827
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,200
regularly

828
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,679
like people were reporting this since

829
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,399
like jeff rosen had pieces out in 28

830
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,799
2012 they were not published in like

831
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,480
nothing publications they were not like

832
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,240
on his blog spot it was in like the new

833
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,039
york times magazine and wired talking

834
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,600
about how this was like the like the the

835
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,840
google the deciders on youtube there

836
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600
were lots of people writing about it but

837
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
there really wasn't this huge shift

838
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,840
until 2018 and i think that basically

839
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,960
then people were like well this is a lot

840
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,520
of power for for private companies to

841
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,240
have that's terrifying to us

842
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,799
uh i guess we should empower

843
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,120
the government to try to save us from

844
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,799
private sensors

845
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,799
without thinking really that we have had

846
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,440
like we have had problems with uh

847
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,279
government sensors uh for longer and uh

848
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,919
to more ill effect uh in in a lot of

849
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,760
countries in a lot of ways hence the

850
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,159
first amendment and so

851
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,679
then it kind of became like what's

852
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,320
blocking us from any type of reform and

853
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,679
i think that the idea that there was one

854
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,080
bill that a lot of techno libertarians

855
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,320
had lauded as basically

856
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,399
being this but for clause to the

857
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,399
internet today just made it

858
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,440
a perfect punching bag for both sides it

859
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,279
has what i call kind of the horseshoe

860
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,600
effect it appears that there is

861
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,480
bipartisan support for 230 reform 230

862
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,799
repeal there is no such bipartisan

863
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,440
support for for the conservatives in the

864
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,679
right think that like basically all of

865
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,360
these sites are over censoring they

866
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,039
would want to get rid of detection 230

867
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,279
for reasons that don't totally make

868
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,919
sense and hue to basically a first

869
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,840
amendment type keep everything up on the

870
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
internet don't take anything down which

871
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,000
i endeavor to point out as kathy says

872
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,760
like would mean that there is we would

873
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,600
have joe rogan

874
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,159
and cat like and misinformation and lots

875
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,159
of pornography which might upset a lot

876
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,000
of our a lot of conservative people as

877
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
well

878
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,559
and then on the same side you have

879
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,960
people arguing for 230 reform on the

880
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
left and some of them are arguing it for

881
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
privacy reasons that don't

882
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
entirely privacy reform which doesn't

883
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,880
entirely make sense and some are arguing

884
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
for it for free speech reform and they

885
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
want more stuff taken down from the

886
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,600
internet they want actually the

887
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,080
platforms to be incentivized to remove

888
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,240
more bad contents to move more hate

889
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,960
speech to remove more disinformation um

890
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,039
about health and other types of issues

891
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,200
around covid and so what you actually

892
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,880
end up having is that you have three

893
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,279
different things that are all calling in

894
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,360
the broadest of possible like dum-dum

895
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,919
terms and if they use a technical uh

896
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,320
legal analysis

897
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,039
reform section 230 like repeal section

898
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,799
230 but none of like the the the actual

899
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,559
mechanics of any of their bills are

900
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,120
going to even touch like or be even like

901
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
anywhere near aligned unlike where this

902
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,960
is what what they would do with that

903
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,720
reform and so

904
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,360
it is uh and also just really quickly

905
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,679
sorry to talk so much uh i would just

906
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,760
endeavor to also point out that there is

907
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
no incentive for them to actually solve

908
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,080
the tech problem it is a

909
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,200
punching bag for everybody on both sides

910
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,600
of the aisle right so no one actually

911
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,519
wants to get rid of it they can score

912
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,000
political capital whether it's votes or

913
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,880
donations by going after big tech saying

914
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,039
that they drafted some bill on section

915
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,120
230 knowing that it doesn't actually

916
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,519
have bipartisan support as like they

917
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,840
claim or people are claiming and so like

918
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,600
i know this is kind of a cynical take

919
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,360
but this is like now after watching this

920
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,000
for four years this is a hundred percent

921
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,720
like i had every i've looked at so many

922
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,080
section 230 reform acts um over the

923
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,240
years and like this is this is a hundred

924
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,039
percent kind of what um what i think it

925
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,960
has been going on and why i just kind of

926
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,640
i also just don't think that this cat

927
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,919
will talk i'm sure we'll talk about

928
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,840
later that it would do any of the things

929
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,919
that people are the most upset about

930
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,240
like it just doesn't actually get at

931
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
what people are upset about with the

932
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,480
internet

933
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,679
i think kate's um kate's spot on

934
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,279
in that like last

935
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,720
last bit that she talked about just

936
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,640
because you know um as as i sit here and

937
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,719
kind of look at the different sort of

938
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,239
case studies that have accomplished mike

939
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,679
i know you've been tracking for many

940
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,199
many years now on like different

941
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,199
instances of people saying like hey i

942
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,359
got censored you know by such and such

943
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,639
platform

944
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,159
or hey like this platform isn't

945
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,079
censoring enough so i put myself in the

946
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,760
shoes of those reviewers at times when i

947
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,320
look at these particular case studies um

948
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,399
particularly in like the era of you know

949
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,079
wanting to reform or repeal 230 and i

950
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,079
just sit here and i i wonder as an ops

951
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,320
person like well what would i do right

952
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,918
because you're

953
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,000
as a as an operations person within the

954
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
company you're being ping-ponged and

955
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,440
being told oh you're taking down too

956
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,960
much oh wait wait you're not taking down

957
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,040
enough and that is a very difficult and

958
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,440
challenging position for um

959
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,960
you know

960
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
yes tech companies are you know these

961
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,719
corporations but there are real people

962
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,239
who are trying to do their jobs on a

963
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,640
daily basis who are motivated by trying

964
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,280
to keep um you know online communities

965
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,119
safe and they're having a really

966
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,359
difficult time and they are actually um

967
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:06,240
you know

968
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,119
um being punching bags for when things

969
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,880
go wrong because they're at the front

970
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,720
line of making all of these decisions

971
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,560
but i don't think that it's purely kind

972
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,119
of like the review teams

973
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,960
fall it's really like the context in

974
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,720
which they're operating is just really

975
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,320
fraught right now and really challenging

976
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,400
and so it's a lose it's always been a

977
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,920
lose-lose situation but it feels like

978
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,400
even more recently it's been even harder

979
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,920
and more challenging for the individuals

980
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,040
who are at the front lines of making

981
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,320
these decisions

982
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,640
and then the other thing too is that

983
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,200
um you know the section 230 conversation

984
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,839
is very much a u.s based one

985
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,359
and the teams that are doing this work

986
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,440
are doing the work on a global level so

987
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,160
on top of having to think about 230 you

988
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,520
know the teams are also impacted by the

989
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,359
regulatory environments in different

990
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,920
area in different regions um you know

991
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,400
and you know you know kate and kathy can

992
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,240
definitely speak more eloquently on

993
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,480
these laws but um you know there have

994
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,040
definitely been more complicated issues

995
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,280
arising in australia right and like in

996
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,480
singapore

997
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,760
um in you know europe all around

998
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,440
what teams are supposed to do or what

999
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
these companies are supposed to do with

1000
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,520
content and so basically what i'm saying

1001
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,280
is that it's a very challenging time for

1002
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,680
your frontline trust and safety um

1003
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
reviewer because there are so many

1004
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,040
considerations that they're trying to

1005
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,400
balance

1006
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,720
yeah i i think that's

1007
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,960
that's a really good point you know and

1008
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,800
one of the things that i recall is kind

1009
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,280
of that that started the kind of shift

1010
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,359
in the debate to like actually everybody

1011
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,760
focusing on 230 was there was uh

1012
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,200
i don't remember the year but it was

1013
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,599
probably 2018 where wired had a big

1014
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,800
cover story about facebook and and

1015
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,839
content moderation uh and multiple times

1016
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,200
in the article

1017
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,480
uh they said that you know like

1018
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,640
facebook told

1019
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,079
you know that the staffer the content

1020
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,920
moderation team

1021
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
you know basically default to not taking

1022
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,320
stuff down because they were afraid of

1023
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,440
losing

1024
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,720
their immunity under 230 which is wrong

1025
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,320
right you you don't you can't under 230

1026
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,160
unless you're creating the content as a

1027
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,839
company you can't lose that that

1028
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,079
immunity and and i i had written

1029
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,440
something and sort of yelled at the

1030
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,240
reporters uh who wrote that article and

1031
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,640
and sort of the the feedback i got back

1032
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,760
was like

1033
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,000
you know yes you you're right that the

1034
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,440
law doesn't say that and they couldn't

1035
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,960
but that is what they told people

1036
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,480
internally and i was trying to

1037
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,599
understand that and i spoke to some

1038
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,079
people and the sense was you know

1039
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:34,960
as

1040
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,800
you know like kate

1041
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,160
mentioned at the beginning you have

1042
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
these global teams and you're trying to

1043
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,280
you know put together a rule that you

1044
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,119
know that you can send off to the

1045
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,040
philippines or india or

1046
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,760
you know wherever uh around the globe

1047
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,079
that can be easily put into practice by

1048
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,160
the the you know the teams that that

1049
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,640
adeline worked with and and

1050
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,480
the easiest thing to say

1051
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,079
is like you know

1052
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,480
try not to you know leave up as much as

1053
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,119
possible to avoid like you know

1054
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,599
having the knowledge to that that

1055
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,280
you know puts us at legal risk around

1056
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,480
the globe

1057
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,640
you know the the different standards are

1058
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,240
changing now but there is this kind of

1059
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,079
you know global question versus u.s

1060
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,920
question and i think

1061
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,040
becomes really really tricky uh you know

1062
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,720
when when it comes into putting these

1063
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,599
things into effect um i i did want to

1064
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,440
talk just because

1065
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,760
i think a point that that kate that you

1066
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,040
raised sort of the

1067
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,960
very different approaches of

1068
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,320
you know sort of the republicans and

1069
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
democrats in terms of the bills that

1070
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,599
they've put forth you know where it does

1071
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,359
feel like one side is basically saying

1072
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,200
like leave everything up and the other

1073
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,359
side is saying take everything down or

1074
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,680
you know take take a lot of stuff down

1075
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,880
which is sort of a

1076
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,040
shorthand version of what a lot of the

1077
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,440
debate is um i do think it would be

1078
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,400
useful

1079
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,760
and kathy i'm going to go to you for

1080
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,400
this one again to talk about you know

1081
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,119
operationally what would actually happen

1082
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,079
if 230 were taken away what what would

1083
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,680
that actually mean

1084
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,240
uh for the various companies and i know

1085
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,000
kate you know earlier

1086
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,440
said like for facebook it actually

1087
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,800
probably wouldn't have that much of an

1088
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,640
impact um but i think it's also

1089
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,079
important to talk about you know other

1090
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,280
companies where i think it would have a

1091
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,200
lot of impact

1092
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,480
yeah um i and i agree with a lot that

1093
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,640
kate is saying but um i actually think

1094
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,359
that facebook is um playing with fire

1095
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,839
because like there's a certain point

1096
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,320
where yeah they've got cash in hand but

1097
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,160
cash isn't your only problem

1098
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,839
because the real issue with section 230

1099
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,599
is it's that lawsuit prevention it's you

1100
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,599
the first amendment is doing most of the

1101
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,800
operation of what 230 ends up doing like

1102
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,280
you have first amendment editorial

1103
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,880
rights about who you want to associate

1104
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,640
with what what expression you want to

1105
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,640
associate with and you get to exercise

1106
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,240
those rights but if somebody's going to

1107
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,160
sue you for how you exercise those

1108
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,119
rights and you're going to have to

1109
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,440
defend each and every decision then all

1110
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,880
the stuff that adeline is talking about

1111
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,480
about there's plenty fraught with just

1112
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,839
figuring out what those decisions are

1113
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,760
going to be that's an extra overtone

1114
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,160
like how are you possibly operationally

1115
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,599
going to be able to continue to make

1116
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,440
moderation decisions

1117
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,000
with any nuance and you know trying to

1118
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,920
get it as right as you can for your user

1119
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,720
base

1120
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
if that's the pressure of like every

1121
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,560
decision is just going to be like we're

1122
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800
going to be calling our lawyers and

1123
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,119
calling lawyers is expensive you calling

1124
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,119
them it's four digits then doing

1125
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,720
something for you is five you're

1126
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,560
actually going into

1127
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,520
a litigation at six and above so you

1128
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,760
cannot possibly do this at scale

1129
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,240
and even for facebook that has the cash

1130
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,079
there's still only a finite amount of

1131
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,920
cash but you also have like a management

1132
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,079
issue of like how do you actually manage

1133
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,599
all the lawyers that you've now had to

1134
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,040
dispatch like are there even enough

1135
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,280
lawyers in the world who could defend

1136
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,800
facebook for all the decisions that it

1137
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,520
needs to now defend so i think even

1138
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,359
facebook is glib but

1139
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,359
this is certainly devastating for any

1140
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,680
smaller company and we've seen this

1141
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,000
happen because like with the dmca which

1142
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,880
is much much weaker where it actually

1143
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,440
was protected for um it wasn't a

1144
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,200
decision to take down it was in this

1145
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,200
case it was decisions to leave up to

1146
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,440
allow certain forms of user-generated

1147
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,280
content that somebody's like i think my

1148
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,119
copyright was totally implicated and i'm

1149
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,040
going to sue you you stupid platform

1150
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
forever letting people post stuff that

1151
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,119
was offending my copyright

1152
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,680
the platform won it had the safe harbor

1153
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,839
under the dmca but it was bankrupted by

1154
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,359
the time it got to the point where it

1155
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,680
was vindicated so what good did that do

1156
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,440
just for for people who aren't aware

1157
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,800
you're talking about a company called vo

1158
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,560
which i think a lot of people don't

1159
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,000
necessarily remember but in the early

1160
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,359
days via was a pretty strong competitor

1161
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,920
to uh to youtube and actually of all

1162
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,920
things was was i think founded by

1163
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,839
michael eisner who had been

1164
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,160
uh chairman of disney and he founded

1165
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,480
this this competitor to youtube called

1166
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,960
veo and they got sued out of sued out of

1167
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,359
existence even though they won the case

1168
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,760
it was too late they won it basically in

1169
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,000
a bankrupt form which was kind of good

1170
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
for everybody else to the extent of like

1171
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,000
at least we got to that decision and

1172
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,599
that's a helpful decision to have on the

1173
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,119
books but

1174
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,119
now everyone's complaining oh

1175
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,000
you know

1176
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,920
google should have competitors well it

1177
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,520
might have been nice if you didn't

1178
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,760
accidentally kill the competitor i would

1179
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,640
have had because actually um to avoid

1180
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,720
the question a little bit like one thing

1181
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,040
that i think is coming up is you know in

1182
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,319
the i was thinking about it with the

1183
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,800
well why is 230 breaking okay so let me

1184
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,640
close the loop on that the problem with

1185
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,960
230 the reason we need to keep it is

1186
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,599
because ultimately 230 is lawsuit

1187
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,800
protection

1188
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,400
the content and the substantive

1189
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,079
decisions this really backfills for the

1190
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,280
first amendment and what the first

1191
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,520
amendment has to say about

1192
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,440
expression free expression the diversity

1193
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,760
of expression editorial choices things

1194
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,040
like that that's a whole separate

1195
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,560
conversation but we're talking about

1196
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,240
what the first amendment does but it's

1197
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,440
no good for the first amendment to

1198
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,000
facilitate editorial choices and also to

1199
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,640
allow diversity of content to be up

1200
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,560
if you're going to get obliterated by

1201
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,079
lawsuits so now we're talking about and

1202
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,440
the problem with all the section 230

1203
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,400
reform is they all create

1204
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,480
the threat of litigation they may move

1205
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,079
it it may not have to do with ultimate

1206
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,760
liability but if you have to litigate

1207
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,359
whether you're protected

1208
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,280
now we've got that dmca veo networks

1209
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,440
problem they didn't lose because of

1210
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,520
liability they got obliterated because

1211
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,520
they had to litigate whether they were

1212
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,200
protected from liability in the first

1213
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
place so every time you poke a hole in

1214
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,720
section 230 that's why i said it's a

1215
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,440
balloon and it just pops because you

1216
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,440
you've just signed up for more lawsuits

1217
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,880
to figure out whether section 230

1218
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,640
applies to you in which case it really

1219
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,880
doesn't matter anymore whether it does

1220
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,040
but i think the question that we can

1221
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,000
come back to is sort of a different one

1222
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,040
which is

1223
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,960
we're getting caught up in the section

1224
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,880
230 debate because i don't think

1225
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,560
we're upset with what's happening on the

1226
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,800
internet but i don't think our concept

1227
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,119
of what the internet is is accurate

1228
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,760
anymore i think it's basically like

1229
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,920
we've become so annoyed to

1230
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,920
a couple of the big tech players as

1231
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,040
being so definitional to what big tech

1232
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,839
is

1233
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,440
that

1234
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,000
you know if if that was truly the world

1235
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,400
where you got google facebook twitter

1236
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,720
throw in a couple others and that was it

1237
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,319
i don't know maybe you do rethink

1238
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,160
section 230 i'm not signing up for this

1239
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,520
do not quote this for me i'm just

1240
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,240
kicking it around as an idea but that's

1241
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,720
not it that's wasn't what it was before

1242
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,560
we're not entirely sure we'd even want

1243
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,640
it to be now there's an awful lot of

1244
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,079
stuff happening on the edges and we're

1245
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,480
not paying attention to it and what 230

1246
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
does and did and does brilliantly is

1247
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,480
help make sure that we can get that

1248
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,800
stuff on the edges and especially now

1249
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,880
that we're so upset about the big

1250
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,160
players and we'd like to have more

1251
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,000
competition for them we absolutely need

1252
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,359
to be looking at the edges but we're

1253
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:46,480
sort of

1254
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,560
we don't recognize that they exist and i

1255
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,160
think of a joke that actually came up in

1256
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,440
the 90s because i talked about those

1257
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,720
walled gardens like aol was like aol

1258
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,560
only it was a big deal when it poked a

1259
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,240
hole and you could actually sign up for

1260
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,720
aol and use it as the isp to go

1261
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,319
surf the information superhighway on the

1262
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,400
world wide web you know there was a joke

1263
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,800
that like people who thought aol was the

1264
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,000
internet were the same people who

1265
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,680
thought taco bell was fine mexican

1266
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,720
cuisine

1267
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,599
like it's just too narrow you have to

1268
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,240
think more broadly about these things so

1269
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,160
that's that's that's my comment here we

1270
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,680
have to think more broadly about what

1271
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,520
the internet actually is because it's

1272
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,960
not these players and we should be able

1273
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,720
to have these policy discussions without

1274
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,310
ever mentioning facebook

1275
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,920
[Laughter]

1276
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,240
so um adeline i

1277
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,000
you know

1278
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,280
sort of taking taking that as a lead um

1279
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,520
you know

1280
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,440
from the operational side from a trust

1281
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,760
and safety side you know if there was a

1282
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,839
situation and you know if there were no

1283
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,079
no 230 and you were in this scenario

1284
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,000
where the decisions that a trust and

1285
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,319
safety team were making would

1286
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,720
potentially impact legal liability and

1287
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,040
potentially cost the company a lot more

1288
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,280
you know operationally how how would

1289
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,160
that even work or would that work what

1290
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,240
would happen uh to companies if they

1291
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,760
sort of had to run every decision by

1292
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,680
legal effectively

1293
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,880
yeah it would not be good um

1294
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,079
it would actually mean that um people

1295
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,160
like me probably wouldn't really have a

1296
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,960
job because then you just put lawyers on

1297
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,800
every single decision rather than having

1298
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,960
a separate um you know trust and safety

1299
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,839
operations teams team um i already see

1300
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,440
this tension a little bit with some of

1301
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,760
the copyright stuff right because you

1302
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,560
have

1303
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,960
um you know uh folks who are doing the

1304
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,040
um intake for

1305
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,160
these um

1306
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,079
you know removal requests or legal

1307
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,280
removal requests and um when things get

1308
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,359
you know kind of hairy right we escalate

1309
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,640
to to legal um and some you know on on

1310
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,160
your worst days when you're escalating

1311
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,280
everything to legal you're sort of

1312
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,720
questioning like why am i even here i'm

1313
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,079
just like pushing a paper around right

1314
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,160
like just have a lawyer do this work but

1315
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,280
lawyers don't really like to do

1316
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,280
operational things like companies so um

1317
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,680
that's why we don't have a lawyer doing

1318
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,359
processing these um dmca tickets um so

1319
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,440
you know in the instance where um you

1320
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,480
know

1321
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,000
everything would have to be sent to a

1322
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,680
lawyer i can imagine i can only imagine

1323
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,720
that

1324
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,880
being really expensive to do because

1325
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,640
lawyers are very expensive

1326
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,319
and you wouldn't have kind of this

1327
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,800
intermediate team helping you scale

1328
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,240
which means everything moves really

1329
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,440
slowly right because what um in in my

1330
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,800
experience what the legal team will

1331
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,880
probably want to do is do a lot more

1332
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,599
case-by-case investigation

1333
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,000
and try to understand the nuance of each

1334
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,160
ticket that comes in whereas like as an

1335
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,040
operations team what we're trained to do

1336
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,000
is to move volume right to scale and

1337
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,480
that's why we have to create these rules

1338
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,839
that allow

1339
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,440
um you know there's no such thing as

1340
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,559
objective but you know we create a set

1341
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,720
of as objective criteria as we can in

1342
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,079
order to move

1343
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,040
um and process complaints and reports um

1344
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,800
and reviews as quickly as possible i

1345
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,040
think the other really kind of um

1346
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,240
worrisome thing is um that you know the

1347
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,480
expectation that you would be reviewing

1348
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,319
every single piece of content on the

1349
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,319
platform even if we weren't escalating

1350
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,720
everything to a legal team um it's just

1351
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,119
sort of um

1352
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,800
you know when you're a really really

1353
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,400
small platform or you're like the

1354
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,400
moderator of really small community you

1355
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,440
know um that scalable right like if you

1356
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,599
were a live journal back in the day

1357
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:22,800
um

1358
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,200
but at the scale of facebook or google

1359
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,880
like that's just really kind of

1360
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,800
impossible so then you're relying on

1361
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,079
automation

1362
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,559
to review content and what gets tricky

1363
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,359
is well then do you start looking at

1364
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,240
um you know very minuscule or like you

1365
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,920
know what what's the atomic unit that

1366
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,559
you start reviewing and then that brings

1367
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,839
into question like a whole lot of

1368
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,000
questions around a user's

1369
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,319
data and a user's privacy and like what

1370
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,800
are they entitled to um you know post

1371
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,400
without you kind of digging into their

1372
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,640
business um that is not an area that i'm

1373
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,680
an expert in um but i can only imagine

1374
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,839
from like a user point of view like the

1375
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,359
backlash would be pretty significant

1376
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,520
because people like to have you know

1377
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,640
some degree of separation between the

1378
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,000
things that they're putting or there is

1379
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,599
an expectation today that there is some

1380
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,119
degree of separation between the

1381
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,800
messages i send you

1382
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,640
right um and whether or not a company

1383
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,760
can can

1384
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,119
look at that

1385
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,359
and when we disintegrate that i think

1386
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,559
there's a lot of um you know terrible

1387
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,640
downstream effects but that's i think

1388
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,040
if that's what the the

1389
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,960
if we lose that protection i can only

1390
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,559
imagine it's a little bit of a slippery

1391
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,079
slope into like okay like we're gonna

1392
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,079
run automation to take a look for look

1393
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,000
for this particular word you know and

1394
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,520
each word can have multiple meanings but

1395
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,880
you know what we're gonna look for look

1396
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,119
for that that word in every single post

1397
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,559
every single dm

1398
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,119
um because if we don't do it we get into

1399
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,040
trouble and our business is gone

1400
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,920
so that i think is really problematic

1401
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,760
yeah um

1402
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,280
kate you know one of the things that

1403
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,960
that you've

1404
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
um you know certainly studied a lot and

1405
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,800
written you know a ton about um is the

1406
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,640
fact that you know how often these

1407
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,800
things are changing and how often these

1408
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,400
companies have to make adjustments in

1409
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,559
terms of their policies and and how how

1410
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,960
they're reviewed and and for folks who

1411
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,440
are interested in this uh beyond reading

1412
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,200
absolutely everything that that kate has

1413
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,480
written uh she's got papers new yorker

1414
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,160
articles new york times stuff like

1415
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,920
there's there's a ton of stuff out there

1416
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,319
all of which is is worth reading uh if

1417
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,160
you if you like listening to stuff i i

1418
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,760
highly recommend there was a radio lab

1419
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,119
episode that that you're in uh that that

1420
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,240
sort of goes deep on on some decisions

1421
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,440
that facebook how to make and i think

1422
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,880
does a really excellent job of

1423
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,760
illustrating like okay we have a policy

1424
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,200
and then it's like oh wait there's an

1425
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,119
exception like oh geez how do we deal

1426
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,720
with this okay maybe we write uh you

1427
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,160
know an amendment and then all of a

1428
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,680
sudden like you find another exception

1429
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,200
to that amendment you're like oh wait we

1430
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,599
have to think about this you know

1431
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,240
can you talk a little bit about like

1432
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,960
just the the reality of of content

1433
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,280
moderation for these platforms at this

1434
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,359
kind of scale the ability to actually

1435
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,440
adjust and change as

1436
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,280
they realize that like you know all of

1437
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,800
the things that i think a lot of people

1438
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,319
on the outside think are kind of black

1439
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,920
and white like this is good content keep

1440
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,920
that up this is bad content take that

1441
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,559
down the reality is that like most of

1442
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,800
the content is in this you know

1443
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,359
large gray area and and you have to sort

1444
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,119
of keep adjusting and changing so can

1445
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,319
you talk a little bit about that and

1446
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,200
sort of

1447
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,839
uh how that works within companies

1448
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,640
yeah um i mean i guess uh it really i

1449
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,800
think that uh there is uh there is a

1450
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,920
trend

1451
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,599
so i think that when i started studying

1452
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,920
this i would have to so this was again

1453
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,000
just like six years ago i would give

1454
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,760
like when i was in the market for a

1455
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,520
professorship and i would give my job

1456
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,319
talk

1457
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,640
and my paper i would like have to start

1458
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,040
the entire conversation with when you

1459
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,040
publish things on facebook they don't

1460
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,839
always stay up on facebook and it's not

1461
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,839
and like people be like oh yeah like

1462
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,240
some super smart ai takes down child

1463
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,720
pornography like thinking that it like

1464
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,440
not like there is some type of algorithm

1465
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,359
that takes down child pornography but it

1466
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,800
doesn't work how they think it does it

1467
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,000
does not like

1468
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,920
know that it is a child in the picture

1469
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,760
and know that it is sexual activity it

1470
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,359
is actually just a matching thing

1471
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,680
because humans have put this huge

1472
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,400
database of known

1473
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,800
um kind of cease what we call csam

1474
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,200
images like child sexual abuse material

1475
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,440
into a database and that known universe

1476
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,160
can be checked against using like a hash

1477
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,240
matching system against kind of anything

1478
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,000
that's uploaded on the site

1479
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,800
um it has gone from much like that was

1480
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,680
like i see sam was the and photo dna was

1481
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,920
kind of in a little bit content id which

1482
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,920
is how they do it is how youtube in

1483
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,119
particular does it to match before

1484
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,839
upload something that is copyrighted and

1485
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,920
like someone is using like an excerpt

1486
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,359
from a too long an excerpt from a

1487
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,839
copyrighted song or some type of like

1488
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,400
sequence from a movie that is not like

1489
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,880
um that is copyrighted and to block that

1490
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,720
from being taken up that type of i call

1491
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,760
it like x anti

1492
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,599
um content moderation because it happens

1493
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,760
before it's published to the rest of the

1494
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,359
world not that it's published on

1495
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,200
facebook servers or something that it

1496
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,040
like that's a different line but that is

1497
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,480
before it's published to the rest of the

1498
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,359
world

1499
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,440
um is where increasingly amount a huge

1500
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,480
amounts of of content are blocked from

1501
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,800
ever appearing and in a legal kind of a

1502
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,040
first amendment kind of analysis we'd

1503
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,280
almost call this like a prior restraint

1504
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,800
type of um

1505
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,480
like type of thing it doesn't even get

1506
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,000
to see the light of day and then we have

1507
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,680
an injunction to make it come down or

1508
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,240
something like that it's actually just

1509
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,240
um it's actually just before anyone sees

1510
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,160
it it's just being it's being memory

1511
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,359
hold um and so this is now how a lot of

1512
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,440
stuff comes down not just for copyright

1513
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,400
but for and for csam but for

1514
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,720
um for uh terrorist material um and

1515
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,559
a number of other things and the sites

1516
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,000
themselves have started to create their

1517
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,240
own internal databases for content that

1518
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,319
they know for currently comes up and

1519
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,720
isn't explicitly illegal to post like

1520
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,359
copyrighted material csam or or or

1521
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,680
terrorism um and so what you have is

1522
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,400
like exactly kind of as alan said is

1523
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,880
that there are these words that become

1524
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,960
like there are these words these natural

1525
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,119
language signifiers that um ai and

1526
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,960
algorithms like recognize

1527
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,680
um either before it's actually published

1528
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,599
or after they run them afterwards if

1529
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,880
like because

1530
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,559
like let's give an example of stop the

1531
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,359
steel before january 6 there was no

1532
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,040
natural language ban on ceps steel but

1533
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,880
there was a lot of content that had gone

1534
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,040
up discussing using that specific

1535
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,799
terminology stopped steel and facebook

1536
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,640
ran a what i would call a post-hoc

1537
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,720
algorithm like after publication ran a

1538
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,640
natural language algorithm on things

1539
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,480
that had appeared sings out of steel and

1540
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,640
removed them or like basically demoted

1541
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,200
them and i think that this is

1542
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,880
but a lot of this stuff is actually

1543
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,559
still being done by human content

1544
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,799
moderators in assistance or in tandem

1545
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,359
with either how you bucket things or how

1546
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,520
ai recognizes certain types of things

1547
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
and then sifts them to to content

1548
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,680
moderators but that being said they're

1549
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,960
still like for every one person for

1550
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,200
every 100 000 people on facebook there

1551
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,839
is one human content moderator um it is

1552
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,480
still like a tremendous tremendous

1553
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,559
amount at scale that like these

1554
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:17,839
companies are expected to be

1555
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,480
adjudicating and in the event that you

1556
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,400
get rid of 230 one thing that i'll just

1557
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,079
and adeline kind of hinted at this one

1558
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:25,920
of the things that i would endeavor to

1559
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,160
say is you put a lot of pressure on the

1560
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,000
individual laborers that are already

1561
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,319
doing a really crappy job of having to

1562
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,799
work and clean up the worst parts of our

1563
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,599
humanity from the internet uh you make

1564
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,079
their job a lot worse because what if

1565
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,160
there is something that they don't

1566
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,799
recognize as defamation for some reason

1567
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,400
and it gets through the cracks and

1568
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,559
facebook gets sued for ten thousand a

1569
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,280
hundred thousand a million dollars right

1570
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,359
and they don't recognize it and now all

1571
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,040
of a sudden do you think like

1572
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,960
that's i mean if they're running with

1573
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,280
that type of decision-making um

1574
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,720
framework in their head of course

1575
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,079
they're going to like side on this on on

1576
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,559
the on the side of of kind of more

1577
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,640
censorship and taking more things down i

1578
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,480
want to endeavor that that's not even a

1579
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,160
corporate policy facebook doesn't have

1580
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,319
to tell them that that is not something

1581
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,400
it is all like soft just behavioral like

1582
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,839
ramifications of what this policy would

1583
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,559
do is that essentially like it would

1584
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,720
create liability for the people on the

1585
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,040
front lines doing a bunch of this work

1586
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,640
um and the one last thing that i'll just

1587
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,839
mention

1588
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,680
that i don't think that like kathy kind

1589
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,359
of talked about with kind of the small

1590
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,280
actors like you know and then we saw

1591
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,200
this with gawker right gawker got sued

1592
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,640
out of existence right but the new york

1593
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,559
times doesn't get sued out of existence

1594
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,359
where

1595
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,200
what's really frustrating for me right

1596
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,880
now is that we're so concerned about how

1597
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,799
big these tech companies are and we're

1598
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,680
so concerned about monopolization powers

1599
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,799
if anything section 230 would absolutely

1600
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,760
create a barrier of entry for new

1601
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,359
entrants to the market

1602
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,119
it would make it so that like you

1603
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,040
wouldn't have as many little gawkers you

1604
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,880
wouldn't have as many like little you

1605
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,359
know as many kind of um

1606
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,680
websites and that they not never like

1607
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,119
never even mind the reddit that like

1608
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,720
might change their policy and like it

1609
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,319
would change the very nature of kind of

1610
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,280
what stays up and comes down to the site

1611
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,079
like

1612
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,680
you just wouldn't have as many people

1613
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,040
because they would be able to be sued

1614
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,960
out of existence just like gawker was

1615
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,480
like versus like the new york times and

1616
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,240
so i think that that is

1617
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,160
i think that when we're talking what's

1618
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,480
so weird to me is that you have certain

1619
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,480
people calling for this level of 230

1620
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,200
reform where it becomes where basically

1621
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,280
uh they want to make it easier to sue

1622
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,359
these platforms without realizing that

1623
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,440
this would really entrench the

1624
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,680
established players and that you would

1625
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,839
actually make the monopolization like

1626
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,640
parts of this so much worse um and i

1627
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,480
wish that that was i wish that that was

1628
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,720
more of a conversation i mean it makes

1629
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,079
perfect sense when you kind of think

1630
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,079
about it but no one is doing the next

1631
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,319
step of kind of thinking about the

1632
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,799
downstream effects of what would happen

1633
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,480
if you got what you wanted with all of

1634
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,920
this 230 and what you wouldn't get like

1635
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,160
so i think that that's i think that's

1636
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,520
the frustration

1637
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,359
yeah i i think that's a that's a really

1638
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,359
good point and and actually works as a

1639
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,960
really good lead-in to the next thing

1640
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,119
that i i wanted to discuss which is

1641
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,640
there has been one

1642
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,960
reform to section 230 that got through

1643
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,040
which is the law that now is referred to

1644
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,640
as foster

1645
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,000
which put an

1646
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,280
exception to section 230 when it

1647
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,880
without getting into all the specifics

1648
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,319
sort of uh

1649
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,280
relates to sex trafficking um

1650
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,640
and

1651
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,680
um

1652
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,680
what was interesting there is it's

1653
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,440
created a whole bunch of

1654
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,960
other issues i think some of which have

1655
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,960
been discussed on other panels at this

1656
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,960
conference

1657
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,440
that were you know even though lots of

1658
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,640
people

1659
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,559
warned that these consequences were

1660
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,040
going to happen uh were mostly ignored

1661
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,799
and i think people are now realizing the

1662
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:56,559
problems there but one sort of very

1663
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,440
simple example of it is as soon as

1664
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,440
foster went into effect

1665
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,799
craigslist

1666
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,359
for one shut down the the

1667
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,400
dating channel on on craigslist uh and a

1668
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,480
few other dating sites also shut down or

1669
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,400
put much more significant restrictions

1670
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,640
on what they could do and tumblr took

1671
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,359
down all of it and tumblr took down all

1672
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,520
of its adult content and ended up

1673
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,839
selling for pennies

1674
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,000
because apparently the adult content was

1675
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,960
fairly important to traffic on tumblr um

1676
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,119
but there were some some pretty

1677
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,480
widespread impact to to foster going

1678
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,880
into effect but one thing that that is

1679
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,400
not talked about as much with that which

1680
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,000
is that uh

1681
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,240
a few months later facebook announced

1682
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,319
their dating service so you have this

1683
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:43,599
sort of very

1684
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,920
like clear example of like craigslist

1685
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,359
shuts down their dating service in

1686
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:48,559
response to

1687
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,440
this this uh you know change to section

1688
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,599
230 and facebook launches a dating

1689
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,680
service a few months later so like

1690
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,520
facebook in a lot of cases can handle

1691
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,680
this stuff and the smaller companies

1692
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,920
cannot so you get that the exact example

1693
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,559
that you were pointing to of of this

1694
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,359
you know consolidation you know uh

1695
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,079
concern about you know dominance or or

1696
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,440
competition uh where reforming 230 might

1697
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,119
might give you the opposite of what most

1698
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,680
people think it would do

1699
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,119
and so related to that i did want to

1700
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,520
bring up just this week um

1701
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,200
you know there's a new bill out and i

1702
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,480
know

1703
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,839
earlier we talked you know a lot of the

1704
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,480
section 230 bills um are sort of

1705
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,680
performative fundraising grandstanding

1706
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,359
vehicles for politicians to just get

1707
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,720
attention and have no chance of actually

1708
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,480
going anywhere the bill that came out

1709
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,400
this week was a reintroduction of a bill

1710
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,440
from from 2020 called the earn it act

1711
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,440
which takes a very fasta like approach

1712
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,119
for csam which we were also just

1713
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,720
discussing and basically saying there's

1714
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,760
there's no uh exemption in that

1715
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,000
in you can't have an exemption in

1716
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,079
section 230 for csam and then it also

1717
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:56,880
has

1718
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,280
a separate part which i think is also

1719
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,319
probably interesting to a lot of

1720
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:02,640
attendees here that it effectively

1721
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,400
attacks encryption

1722
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,319
and and we can get into the specifics of

1723
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,839
why and how if that's necessary

1724
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:13,119
um but you know kathy i i wanted to talk

1725
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,000
about earn it because i think it's a it

1726
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,599
you know unlike most of these bills it

1727
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,200
has i think 19 different senators uh

1728
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,480
signed on as sponsors or co-sponsors um

1729
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,960
you know and and bipartisan so it has an

1730
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,599
awful lot of support um

1731
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:30,799
and

1732
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,359
is really you know an attempt to reform

1733
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,760
section 230 that might have have real

1734
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,760
power so kathy do you want to talk a

1735
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,440
little bit about

1736
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,680
you know earn it and and kind of what

1737
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,440
what it does and what the concerns are

1738
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,680
there

1739
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,040
can i say no

1740
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,720
i understand you might not want to but i

1741
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,720
think it's important for the

1742
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,240
people here to

1743
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,799
to to hear about it well quite frankly

1744
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:59,359
one of the problems is um

1745
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,119
those of us who

1746
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,000
try to not have 230 fall apart are a

1747
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,559
little tired there's been bill after

1748
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,839
bill after bill after bill and this one

1749
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,160
is my brain isn't fully there i was busy

1750
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,000
complaining about it last year and i

1751
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,680
haven't fully like break myself on all

1752
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,960
the reasons to complain about it this

1753
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,119
year but let me talk general broad

1754
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,559
strokes of things

1755
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,440
that would be terrible and are probably

1756
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,039
in this bill too because it's terrible i

1757
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,960
mean and some of what we've talked about

1758
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,079
is

1759
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,000
just this whole idea about what it is

1760
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,480
that you're doing um one of the things

1761
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,559
that shows up not necessarily in earn it

1762
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,000
but in some of the other bills that have

1763
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,799
come up is this mistaken notion that

1764
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,760
section 230 is a special privilege

1765
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,440
and that we want to conditional that

1766
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,039
privilege like if a company is not good

1767
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,799
enough in another area and maybe they're

1768
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,880
not i mean companies are large complex

1769
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,160
and sometimes

1770
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,079
innocent actors and sometimes bad actors

1771
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,000
so like they may need some hand slapping

1772
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,559
in certain places but this idea that if

1773
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,400
they needed their hands slapped we're

1774
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,839
gonna take away their section 230

1775
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,359
privileges like

1776
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,599
it's not a privilege it's a fundamental

1777
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:04,960
part of making the first amendment

1778
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,599
meaningful so that every single platform

1779
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,319
can exist on the internet so i don't

1780
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,920
think earn it necessarily does that but

1781
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,119
some of the other bills that have been

1782
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,119
proposed come from that standpoint and

1783
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,280
that's bad i mean but i think earn it

1784
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,119
does kind of come from that too but

1785
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,440
because it's baked into this idea of

1786
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,200
be good and now it's all coming back to

1787
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,240
me

1788
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,400
the nightmares the flashbacks

1789
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,559
but this idea that if you are not good

1790
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,240
enough here we're going to take away

1791
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,760
something you really like having of here

1792
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,599
as if you know no you didn't need your

1793
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,359
brussels sprouts so no dessert for you

1794
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,359
that's not also how the section 230

1795
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,520
works it's not how it can work because

1796
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,880
the other point that i raised talking

1797
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,119
about this balloon is

1798
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,520
you you can't have the friction and

1799
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,039
still expect it to be a meaningful

1800
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,039
protection the point is like when people

1801
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,799
like adeline are doing their job she

1802
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,640
shouldn't have to think about this she

1803
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,640
shouldn't have to have like is as legal

1804
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,799
as it's not legal um you know she should

1805
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,240
just be making the decisions of like

1806
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,680
what are the most what are the best

1807
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,000
decisions we can make for our community

1808
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
like that's hard enough

1809
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,680
that's what you should be worrying about

1810
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,640
and every time you make section 230 and

1811
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:12,319
if and not out of that it you add that

1812
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,720
friction and you make everything harder

1813
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,319
less useful and you're never going to

1814
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,400
get good results of it so the fact that

1815
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,720
they're taking like the biggest most

1816
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,960
profound provocative

1817
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,280
issues like you know see sam this is bad

1818
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,200
this is stuff that actually needs an

1819
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,760
appropriately tailored policy problem

1820
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,000
and you're just throwing bricks at it

1821
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,400
with no nuance no understanding no

1822
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,079
operational understanding of what this

1823
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,160
would do how it affects people's jobs

1824
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,480
what they would actually do like they

1825
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,680
have to be good enough what does good

1826
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,520
enough even mean and now you're going to

1827
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,640
like take recess away from everybody

1828
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,319
this is terrible and what the

1829
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,000
conversations earlier this week talking

1830
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,160
about like the devastation of foster is

1831
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,799
it has it doesn't just destroy things

1832
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,400
generally but it tends to actually

1833
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,640
really specifically hurt exactly the

1834
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,280
same interest who ostensibly the bills

1835
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,280
are supposed to protect what happened to

1836
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,640
sex workers

1837
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,240
is terrible there is a body count

1838
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,000
associated with foster and they in

1839
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,200
theory were the people that this bill

1840
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,280
was supposed to be standing up for

1841
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,119
that's ridiculous that's like grossly

1842
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,440
negligent law making and we should not

1843
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,359
be tolerating it we should be looking at

1844
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,200
the effects and what people are also

1845
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,640
pointing out like now you're going to

1846
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,400
dragon encryption you're going to talk

1847
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,240
about the most fundamental things about

1848
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,480
why free expression is important to

1849
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,960
fight against democracy while like

1850
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,640
people in ukraine are like desperate to

1851
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,240
be able to talk to each other with some

1852
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,240
security so that they don't get invaded

1853
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,039
and attacked and you know terrorized

1854
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,000
like

1855
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,440
how can this be consistent with our

1856
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,760
overall policy to be chipping away with

1857
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,039
anything that protects the free

1858
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,440
expression that democracy and freedom

1859
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,880
depend on

1860
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,400
don't do it it's terrible like the

1861
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,079
details of this bill yes they're worth

1862
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,000
talking about in some detail but in

1863
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,720
broad but the details aren't the issue

1864
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,799
fundamentally misguided in terms of what

1865
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,240
it's trying to do as a regulatory

1866
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,240
solution and will only hurt including

1867
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:02,559
and especially what is ostensibly trying

1868
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,359
to help

1869
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,559
so so

1870
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,240
just for for background because i think

1871
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,599
the discussion on earning is going to be

1872
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:09,839
important i do think it is important

1873
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,880
i will give a sort of very kind of uh a

1874
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,839
quick

1875
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,440
um

1876
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,520
you know uh

1877
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,720
quick uh

1878
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,599
summary of of earn it uh in the loosest

1879
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:22,960
terms without going too deep into the

1880
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,960
weeds but basically it creates an

1881
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,359
exception for for csam and says that you

1882
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,280
know platforms that have csam don't get

1883
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,520
230 protection which um would

1884
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,359
you know be interesting to discuss if

1885
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:37,440
there were cases of companies using

1886
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,359
section 230 to protect themselves

1887
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,039
against lawsuits involving csem and

1888
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,480
those don't seem to exist so it's

1889
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,920
unclear what problem they're actually

1890
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,240
solving in the documents that are that

1891
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,480
are presented uh by the sponsors of the

1892
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,400
bill in support of it they're claiming

1893
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,960
that different companies don't take csam

1894
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,280
seriously enough uh and that this is

1895
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,799
somehow creates an incentive for them to

1896
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,960
take it more seriously but that's

1897
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,359
actually again not how the law works and

1898
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,039
and how you know what a lot of was

1899
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,960
discussed earlier you know it then

1900
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,640
becomes a question of actually who has

1901
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,119
knowledge of different things and by

1902
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,200
exempting it from from

1903
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,520
uh 230 you're actually creating more

1904
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,119
incentive for the companies not to have

1905
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,720
knowledge because if they don't have

1906
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,480
knowledge then they don't have liability

1907
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,920
so by creating this thing this is like

1908
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,119
now you might be liable if you have

1909
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:22,640
knowledge that actually gives companies

1910
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,680
less incentive to search out or to to

1911
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,680
install a database you know to use

1912
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,359
something like photodna or one of the

1913
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,039
other services that are out there to try

1914
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,760
and find csam so the end result is is i

1915
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,480
think more dangerous and actually puts

1916
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,960
you know uh creates a bigger csam

1917
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,559
problem than

1918
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,400
the situation that we have now and then

1919
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,920
the the attack on encryption is

1920
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,680
basically

1921
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,240
there's it's really tricky and in an

1922
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,400
annoying way and that there is a section

1923
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,079
in the bill that kind of says like this

1924
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,799
doesn't impact encryption except it does

1925
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,960
because of the language that is used it

1926
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,559
says that like

1927
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,480
basically a company cannot be sued under

1928
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,599
this bill

1929
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,640
solely for having implemented encryption

1930
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,839
however

1931
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:08,799
uh it says that the fact that they use

1932
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,200
encryption could still be evidence that

1933
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,280
they are a bad actor and are basically

1934
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,960
trying to hide hide from the fact that

1935
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,198
they have ccm on their platform which

1936
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,679
then makes you know having encryption

1937
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,080
end-to-end encryption on your platform

1938
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,040
a

1939
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,040
liability uh you know and a risk that

1940
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,359
you would have to fight over in court

1941
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,960
um so

1942
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,319
um

1943
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,198
moving on from from earn it specifically

1944
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:35,520
um i you know

1945
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,799
uh

1946
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,560
there's like so many different issues

1947
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,359
here

1948
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,319
that we could go go uh down the path on

1949
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,759
um

1950
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,439
you know one of the debates that's come

1951
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,319
up this week uh uh you know really the

1952
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:50,399
last couple weeks is like

1953
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,158
you know whenever content moderation

1954
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,560
questions come up people sort of run to

1955
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,399
230 as if that is

1956
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,479
the the underlying cause of anything so

1957
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,319
right now there's been this big fight

1958
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:01,120
over

1959
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,839
spotify right and spotify should they be

1960
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,439
hosting joe rogan or not i see the the

1961
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,238
scowl on kathy's face uh

1962
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,198
and

1963
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,719
um and there's been some discussion

1964
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,960
people keep bringing up like 2 30 2 30.

1965
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,719
i'm on both sides of this like you know

1966
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,238
whether or not spotify should host joe

1967
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,719
rogan my argument and i have a blog post

1968
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,040
that's going up sometime today is that

1969
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,080
this is not a 230 issue at all but a ton

1970
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,759
of people are considering it one so

1971
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,279
uh am i

1972
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,560
wrong is it is it a 230 issue spotify

1973
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,839
determining whether or not to keep joe

1974
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,839
rogan on the platform or is it not a 230

1975
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,279
issue

1976
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,399
kathy i'll i'll toss that to you first

1977
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:44,640
um

1978
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,479
i mean

1979
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,238
there's i think two questions rolled up

1980
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:50,640
into it technically is it a 2 30 issue

1981
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,560
which is an interesting question

1982
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,439
and

1983
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,759
you know

1984
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,719
is it a technical question or is it an

1985
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:02,800
analogy question because i think some of

1986
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,679
this is

1987
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:04,880
the technical question isn't the

1988
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,239
interesting one it's this idea of

1989
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,560
thou shalt be responsible for what

1990
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,480
somebody else has done and this is a

1991
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,560
recurrent thing that's showing up in all

1992
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,800
of the section 230 pushes the idea that

1993
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,880
we want

1994
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,120
platforms to be their users keeper and

1995
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,040
that we want to hold them accountable if

1996
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,719
they're not and to some extent that

1997
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,800
makes sense

1998
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,480
um like

1999
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,040
but in some sense it gets carried away

2000
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,120
and i and starts to become poisonous and

2001
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,880
then you turn into like the discussions

2002
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,400
about cancel culture some of which are

2003
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,920
ridiculous and some of which actually do

2004
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,040
make sense

2005
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,080
um

2006
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,080
i want to say no it's not a section 230

2007
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,360
issue just because i don't want the

2008
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,199
provocative feelings and forming this

2009
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,199
discussion to be tainting this policy

2010
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,040
area which is too important and needs to

2011
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,560
get right technically so i'm going to

2012
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,320
say no although i'm not sure that

2013
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
technically that's necessarily true if

2014
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:57,840
they were getting sued they would have

2015
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,080
an interesting section 230 defense but i

2016
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,840
think the larger cultural thing about

2017
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,320
like what does it mean to be associated

2018
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,280
with other

2019
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,880
content

2020
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:08,400
that's an interesting question but i

2021
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,440
don't know if it's always being

2022
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,520
discussed in an interesting way there's

2023
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,679
a lot of reaction that isn't

2024
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,320
particularly useful

2025
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,080
mike can i jump in really quickly

2026
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,239
because i have to take off and teach um

2027
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,600
75 1l's adverse possession

2028
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,719
um

2029
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,360
which is the only thing um i i like

2030
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,880
discussing even slightly more than

2031
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,719
section 230 um but the um i i i will

2032
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:35,199
just say that uh i don't think that

2033
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,840
uh there is no part about the due right

2034
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,840
thing that is the section 230 thing

2035
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,600
except that it's on the internet it is

2036
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,040
100 like except that people mistake it

2037
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,800
for a section 230 thing because it's on

2038
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,640
the internet that is like literally the

2039
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,880
only that's like the meta not the meta

2040
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,280
facebook way but the meta meta way of

2041
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,520
like actually thinking about it like if

2042
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,760
we say that every internet problem is a

2043
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,840
230 problem will it eventually suddenly

2044
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,120
turn out to be true um uh i hope not

2045
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:03,920
like

2046
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,440
but um no it's a one it's a first

2047
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,840
amendment problem at least um from the

2048
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,000
thing and also adeline is that a very

2049
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,080
fuzzy fuzzed up version of your cat that

2050
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,560
is appearing in your screen

2051

01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,800
much kate for for joining us and taking

2059
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,520
part um so i'm gonna i'm gonna jump

2060
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,760
we've been getting some questions uh in

2061
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:40,320
the in the slack uh and i wanna i wanna

2062
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,679
bring some of those questions in because

2063
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,120
i think there's some some really

2064
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,679
interesting ones so you know someone

2065
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,239
asked uh whether or not some of the new

2066
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,640
proposed regulations regarding

2067
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,840
uh like

2068
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,199
uh transparency and and fairness

2069
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,159
regarding the the algorithms um

2070
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:59,760
are actually a

2071
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,239
sufficient answer to to these different

2072
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:05,040
challenges in terms of you know how how

2073
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,800
companies deal with this content so you

2074
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,640
know and i know there's a there's been a

2075
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,320
push for like if the companies were more

2076
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,159
transparent about their policies somehow

2077
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,000
that would solve things i mean some of

2078
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,679
the laws go so far to say like you know

2079
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,360
you one you have to be transparent and

2080
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,040
then if you make a decision that

2081
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,800
disagrees with the policies i think that

2082
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,239
becomes really problematic but but um

2083
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:25,280
what do

2084
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,080
you know

2085
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,000
from kathy's standpoint the the legal

2086
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,480
aspect and from adeline's standpoint you

2087
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,679
know if

2088
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,120
you had to be really transparent about

2089
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,120
the policies does that does that change

2090
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,760
anything does that fix anything

2091
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,280
uh and

2092
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,520
adeline i'll go to you first in terms of

2093
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,239
like

2094
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,920
if if there was a law requiring the

2095
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,239
companies to be more transparent and and

2096
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,719
reveal either their policies or like you

2097
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,000
know the details of how the the

2098
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,560
algorithmic stuff worked um

2099
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,080
would that

2100
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:56,400
how would that work in practice

2101
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,360
yeah i think um you know i actually can

2102
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,440
i just make one play with talking about

2103
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,719
the earn it act and see that because um

2104
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,880
um i just kind of wanted to flag that in

2105
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,400
all my years of working in content

2106
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,320
moderation and working with teams that

2107
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,840
have had to

2108
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:14,960
um touch upon csun in some way shape or

2109
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,239
form whether that's like on the trust

2110
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:17,760
and safety side or on the technical side

2111
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,000
or on the legal side or even other other

2112
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,239
places in the business i have never met

2113
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:25,520
a single person who did not care about

2114
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,199
child sexual abuse material on the

2115
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,640
internet and so um for there to be an

2116
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,120
impression that the companies don't care

2117
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,080
i think it's that's a very like that's a

2118
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,600
poor misconception about what's

2119
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,800
happening at these companies because

2120
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,199
i've never met a single person who said

2121
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,560
oh you know what i'm just not going to

2122
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,400
resource this there are issues that come

2123
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,159
up around resourcing

2124
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:47,520
which are fair

2125
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,239
um but people do care about it

2126
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:53,360
um so um and i just think it does a lot

2127
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,239
of individual people a disservice when

2128
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,719
we talk about the tech companies as you

2129
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,719
know these monolithic

2130
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,320
entities without thinking about the real

2131
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,000
people who are encountering this content

2132
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,600
every day and trying to do the right

2133
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,320
thing

2134
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,520
but anyway on to transparency um

2135
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,520
so i think there actually has been a

2136
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,520
pretty um

2137
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,080
kind of um proactive i guess like

2138
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,560
movement for companies to be very

2139
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,320
transparent about what they're doing you

2140
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,600
know you see that

2141
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,800
you know back in the day when i was at

2142
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,040
google we were actually revamping our

2143
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,719
help center to be super transparent

2144
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,640
about all the things that we considered

2145
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,400
you know out of scope or within scope of

2146
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,640
a policy we gave examples we tried very

2147
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,920
hard to explain

2148
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,600
things i think even on the engineering

2149
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,719
side there were a couple blog posts

2150
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:38,239
about like hey this is how we you know

2151
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,480
determine from an automation point of

2152
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,640
view if something is problematic or not

2153
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,239
um but there are going to always be

2154
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,000
certain areas where transparency is just

2155
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,760
not feasible right because people start

2156
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,440
to game the system and then you start to

2157
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,400
see

2158
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,120
people coming up to right up to the line

2159
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,320
and you know that's possibly what's

2160
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,480
happening in the case of joe rogan right

2161
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,000
where you are very clear about your

2162
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,840
policies around what you know what

2163
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,480
constitutes um misinformation

2164
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,480
but people are going to use that

2165
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,320
information and get really close to mine

2166
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,000
so there's always going to be that gray

2167
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,679
area that requires

2168
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:13,360
more discussion or more more escalation

2169
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,920
but in in my opinion i think you know

2170
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,560
you could ask for more transparency

2171
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,400
for sure i think a lot of the companies

2172
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,600
are doing their best to be as

2173
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,520
transparent as possible without you know

2174
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,280
revealing too much about the secret

2175
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,800
sauce of their own business which i

2176
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,719
think is a very fair thing to protect um

2177
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,120
because that's proprietary you know

2178
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,159
business

2179
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:36,320
information um and you know you

2180
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,159
you know i've seen companies i'm not

2181
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:39,520
trying to be like a show for these for

2182
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,120
these companies even though i recognize

2183
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,120
i'm starting to sound like like one but

2184
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,520
um i feel like uh also the the teams

2185
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,960
that i've worked with have tried to

2186
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,480
bring in outside perspectives um you

2187
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,400
know on a more quiet basis to take a

2188
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,920
look at the policies and say like hey

2189
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,880
are we doing the right thing being

2190
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,560
transparent and private right which i

2191
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,400
guess is a very odd thing to kind of

2192
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,080
counter intuitive thing but

2193
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,679
i think that that really does help to

2194
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,440
bring in civil society groups to poke

2195
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,440
holes at your policies and provide you

2196
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,280
with input and also to take a look at

2197
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,880
your algorithm algorithms right

2198
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,239
particularly with the conversation

2199
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,120
around

2200
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,440
algorithmic bias i know of teams that

2201
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,040
are trying to do the right thing by

2202
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,360
bringing outside experts in and being

2203
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,199
transparent with them in order to build

2204
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,040
better policies but i think full

2205
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,320
transparency is just going to be a

2206
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,120
little bit harder for companies to

2207
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,440
get around to just because there are so

2208
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,440
many ways to game the system

2209
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,960
um but yeah

2210
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,400
yeah i think that's actually a really

2211
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,960
important point and one that is really

2212
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,040
very rarely discussed on the question of

2213
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:40,000
transparency is is you know how much of

2214
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,120
you know

2215
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,120
there's obviously benefits in being able

2216
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,360
to to have other eyes look through it

2217
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,640
and go through it but but some of those

2218
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,320
eyes are the people who are trying to to

2219
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,960
game it you know and and oftentimes it's

2220
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,000
you know the

2221
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:52,960
the

2222
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,239
you know uh abusive users or the trolls

2223
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,000
who are you know who want to know the

2224
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,159
exact line that they can get up to and

2225
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,960
also want to litigate every decision and

2226
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,679
say like well your rules say you know as

2227
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:07,840
long as i don't do this i'm okay and so

2228
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,360
the fact that i did everything to sort

2229
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,760
of pretend i wasn't doing that um

2230
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,520
becomes an issue and then you know the

2231
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,440
other issue that i've seen is is again

2232
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,840
sort of like the disparate impact on

2233
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,440
different different types of companies

2234
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,960
as well in terms of you know uh can you

2235
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,960
know a facebook or a twitter put

2236
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,760
together a team to to sort of present

2237
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,679
the the rules in a transparent way and

2238
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,560
continue to adapt and change and do that

2239
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,360
um like sure you know they there's they

2240
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,360
have the money to do that whereas

2241
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:38,800
smaller companies that are sort of

2242
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,520
forced to do this it becomes then like a

2243
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,600
huge task for for some of them to to

2244
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,280
handle the transparency

2245
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,360
um kathy did you want to discuss the

2246
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,920
transparency angle on the uh from the

2247
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,280
legal perspective

2248
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,280
yeah i mean there's a gigantic first

2249
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,239
amendment issue sitting here um and

2250
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,640
think about it as like your own self

2251
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,400
like you know if you're on twitter and

2252
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,920
you're retweeting things well you're

2253
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,719
kind of amplifying some things well

2254
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:07,199
explain yourself why did you do that one

2255
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,120
why did you do that you better say so

2256
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,040
because your legal rights are going to

2257
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,960
hinge in the balance of did you say so

2258
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,800
and you know arguably in a way that we

2259
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,640
approve of like why did you amplify

2260
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,719
defend yourself like don't you find that

2261
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,320
a little bit chilling if that was the

2262
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,280
law you need to live within well if

2263
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,280
that's chilling and sort of contrary to

2264
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,280
your own first amendment express of

2265
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,760
interest as an individual why do we

2266
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,679
think that that's not the case when

2267
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:32,880
you've just glued a whole bunch of

2268
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,360
individuals together in a company like

2269
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,199
if you if it's true that your first

2270
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:38,719
amendment rights get extinguished at a

2271
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,159
certain size we need to be able to

2272
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:43,440
articulate very clearly when wow and how

2273
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,400
and why because that's a pretty big deal

2274
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,760
um

2275
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,760
and uh you know so if you think about

2276
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,880
that like that doubt shalt do it like

2277
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,679
um i don't know let me ask adeline like

2278
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:58,480
if you had to defend every decision

2279
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,040
would you find that i'll ask a leading

2280
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,960
question would you find that chilling

2281
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,760
yes

2282
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,880
okay

2283
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,840
so the fact that there is that effect

2284
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,520
is sort of like this is why it should

2285
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,239
not be in law now otherwise i think it's

2286
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:16,880
kind of interesting i i i've written

2287
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,120
posts like arguing that transparency is

2288
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,520
good i'm most concerned about like i

2289
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,120
like the transparency reports when they

2290
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,679
report when did an external pressure

2291
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,280
drive the system

2292
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,880
that's the stuff i really want to see

2293
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,480
because that's the thing i really want

2294
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,600
the most illumination on of like when

2295
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,280
i don't really mind

2296
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,360
however like arbitrary a platform wants

2297
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,199
to be adeline do whatever you want it's

2298
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,960
totally cool like because if you do a

2299
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,880
terrible job you'll just lose your users

2300
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,440
and you know that's your consequence um

2301
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,120
but like do whatever makes sense for you

2302
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:48,639
and like okay fine learn about your

2303
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:50,400
community so you can do the best job for

2304
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,239
them but like whatever if you really

2305
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,000
screw it up and your users wander away

2306
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,639
then that's on you but when somebody is

2307
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:58,719
like pressing on you to make you decide

2308
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,800
things in certain ways like

2309
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,719
i really care about that and your users

2310
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,000
will care about that and that's the

2311
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,440
thing i really want transparency but

2312
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,320
like even to mandate that like again

2313
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,080
like explain yourself explain yourself

2314
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,400
now like no that's compelled speech and

2315
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,360
there's a reason that the first

2316
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,199
amendment says don't do it i mean the

2317
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,199
first amendment like says don't do an

2318
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:18,800
awful lot of speech that might be a good

2319
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,400
idea but it when you force it it's not

2320
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,639
freedom and then like you lose that free

2321
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,080
expression and then like the whole house

2322
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,920
of cards falls down so yeah

2323
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,239
not a good plan adeline go ahead sorry

2324
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:31,760
um i was also just going to say if

2325
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,679
you're mandating transparency at a

2326
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:36,880
certain level and requiring um you know

2327
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,120
reporting of certain things given the

2328
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,880
diversity of

2329
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,120
platforms and companies that exist you

2330
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,719
can't really have an apples-to-apples

2331
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,880
conversation about those metrics right

2332
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,719
and i think that that's also

2333
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,159
you know it's not just the data about

2334
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,040
kind of

2335
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,040
what's being removed and how things are

2336
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,719
being removed but there's also an

2337
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,120
analysis portion that gets lost in the

2338
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,360
mix when you're requiring a certain

2339
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,679
standard right and if we're only going

2340
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,920
to look to the facebook or google or

2341
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,000
youtube standard we're doing all of

2342
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,360
these other platforms into service

2343
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,639
because then we're not actually

2344
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,639
understanding how they're doing

2345
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,560
so yeah i mean i think that's a really

2346
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,840
good point and one of the things that

2347
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,080
that i point out is like you know look

2348
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,320
at at how a rule like that would impact

2349
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,560
certain other platforms like reddit

2350
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,400
or wikipedia i mean wikipedia to some

2351
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,920
extent right all the edits are

2352
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,760
transparent but the reasons why are not

2353
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,320
necessarily and reddit you know you have

2354
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,400
different different subreddits that have

2355
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,400
their own rules and their own moderation

2356
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,320
and you know how do they put forth a

2357
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,239
sort of more transparent explanation of

2358
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,080
that the other example that i've used

2359
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,600
and that i think gets to some of the

2360
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,679
points that kathy was making was you

2361
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:42,960
know when you talk about the

2362
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,199
transparency for the decisions it's like

2363
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:48,239
you know if if congress put together a

2364
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:50,800
law that said like fox news had to be

2365
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,480
transparent about who they chose to put

2366
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,280
on

2367
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,600
the you know on fox news and who they

2368
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,120
chose not to put on or the new york

2369
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,280
times had to explain who they were

2370
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,600
willing to publish on the editorial page

2371
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,440
and who they weren't uh

2372
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,760
you know interested in publishing on the

2373
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,199
page i think everyone was sort of

2374
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,800
recognized that's a first amendment

2375
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,880
issue you know the editorial discretion

2376
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,639
that fox news has and that the new york

2377
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,719
times have you know that's protected by

2378
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,480
the first amendment and so you know

2379
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,639
demanding the the transparency of the

2380
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,360
platforms raises some some serious first

2381
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,000
amendment issues related to that

2382
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,400
um so you know one of the another

2383
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,239
questions sort of come up uh and i've

2384
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,400
seen this one a lot and it kind of

2385
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,880
came up in the slack as well is you know

2386
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,080
when you're talking about sort of like

2387
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,760
the the algorithmic

2388
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,320
uh promotion of content

2389
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,239
does that change the calculus in terms

2390
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,080
of you know if facebook is promoting

2391
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,360
this content

2392
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,120
um and there's some arguments and some

2393
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,639
people have pushed for laws that say

2394
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,320
like if the algorithm promotes the

2395
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,960
content you no longer get 230 uh for

2396
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,880
that and so

2397
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,040
um you know what would the impact be of

2398
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,000
that uh you know should should 230 apply

2399
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,520
to content that is algorithmically

2400
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,800
promoted

2401
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,560
i think the answer to the question is do

2402
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,199
you think that bookstores

2403
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,800
should potentially be liable for the

2404
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,639
books that they sell because they put

2405
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,320
them in the window

2406
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,280
like algorithmic promotion happens all

2407
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,159
the time we're usually cool with it but

2408
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,400
it also kind of in that context you can

2409
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,639
sort of see why it needs to happen the

2410
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,360
pivot point for 230 is really who

2411
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,360
created it and in particular like who

2412
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,960
imbued it with the particularly wrongful

2413
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,280
quality and there's a lot of arguments

2414
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,800
that people will throw that like well if

2415
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,960
you enabled it attracted it facilitated

2416
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,760
amplified it you've created it but you

2417
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,560
really

2418
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,280
know that's that's asking for too much

2419
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:41,440
legally that needs to be much more

2420
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,320
separate you know facilitating or

2421
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,320
promoting or amplifying is not the same

2422
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,480
thing as creating the content and

2423
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,480
imbuing it with the wrongful character

2424
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:51,920
and it's really important that section

2425
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:54,320
230 pivots on that point about whether

2426
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,960
you're the protected ics or whether

2427
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,480
you're the information content provider

2428
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,120
who's not protected um it's hard for i

2429
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,320
think for people to get their heads

2430
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,400
around because it feels like a handshake

2431
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:05,120
but

2432
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,400
i think it's important that we don't go

2433
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,600
out of our way to like find that

2434
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,040
handshake that's a really important

2435
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,960
delineation that will be

2436
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,400
230 scales better and more usefully um

2437
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,040
and protects the first amendment more

2438
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,520
successfully when we don't construe

2439
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,280
creation to

2440
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,280
facilitators so

2441
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:27,760
no legally and no we shouldn't anyway

2442
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,320
um so a sort of related question that

2443
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,120
that i think comes up a lot is this idea

2444
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,080
of like

2445
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,480
whether or not like product liability

2446
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:39,600
laws are are a way to get around 230 or

2447
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,360
should be a way to get around 230 where

2448
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,960
they say you know

2449
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,199
you designed your product in a way and

2450
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,960
this touches on the sort of

2451
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,719
amplification questions to some extent

2452
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:51,040
you designed your product in a way that

2453
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,520
you know enabled you know this bad

2454
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,400
content

2455
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,400
to be more prominent and therefore you

2456
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,320
are you are liable for it because you

2457
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,239
were you know or or you were negligent

2458
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,440
in how you designed your product um

2459
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,400
do you do you have a response to that

2460
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,800
there be dragons this is this is

2461
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,239
because one of the things we have to

2462
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:12,960
recognize how much of this is speech

2463
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,480
how much even the

2464
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,560
the creation of the platform is an

2465
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,320
expressive activity this is based in

2466
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,920
code code is a language code is a

2467
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,960
language you've now expressed um

2468
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,120
this isn't the same thing as designing a

2469
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,600
physical car where the nuts and the

2470
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:29,600
bolts were weak and couldn't hold so

2471
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,600
your wheel fell off and

2472
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,800
drawing the

2473
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,800
analogy between the two is a really

2474
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,400
really really bad idea because it does

2475
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,120
not stay constrained to

2476
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,880
um well i don't like this particular use

2477
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,239
case in this particular use case

2478
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,239
somebody got hurt i don't want to poo

2479
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:45,840
poo that but

2480
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,239
your remedy is something where if you

2481
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,400
can find liability there

2482
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,800
you can find liability everywhere and

2483
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,600
ben goes out all sorts of websites free

2484
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,440
expression e-commerce services all sorts

2485
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,960
of stuff so um you can more clearly draw

2486
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,560
a line to say no this is not the same

2487
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,400
this is speech issues

2488
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,239
and negligent design of how you

2489
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,560
facilitated expression imagine your

2490
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,120
favorite totalitarian like using that

2491
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,280
language on his dissidents i'm sorry you

2492
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,040
facilitated that language and they did

2493
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,480
something that like

2494
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,000
offended the national security law of

2495
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,280
hong kong like

2496
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,280
that language could be scaled by all

2497
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,480
sorts of people who want to make sure

2498
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,560
that nobody can speak freely

2499
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,560
it also seems a little bit like a like

2500
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,760
an oversimplification of kind of what a

2501
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,760
product is

2502
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,440
to me right because there are

2503
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,120
particularly content moderation and i

2504
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,199
think one of the things that um you know

2505
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,600
i really hope um more folks will get a

2506
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,120
more sophisticated understanding of is

2507
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,199
that it's not just about like leaving up

2508
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:45,199
content and taking down content right

2509
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,120
there's a whole array of things that go

2510
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,960
into the complexity of content

2511
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,760
moderation you could do like you know

2512
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,600
you could do things like throttling um

2513
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,600
the popularity of a piece of content you

2514
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,760
could hide a piece of content from you

2515
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,840
know the broader public and only to you

2516
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,199
know only allow it to be visible to

2517
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,360
select few people lots of platforms do

2518
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,920
that you could prevent recommendations

2519
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:08,639
you could um inhibit um certain things

2520
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,560
from showing up in in search results

2521
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,760
right um so to to have kind of this um

2522
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,719
you know

2523
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:17,440
um kind of blunt approach like hey like

2524
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,040
your product messed up yeah like my

2525
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,960
product can mess up in a million

2526
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,679
different ways right because i have like

2527
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,600
three engineers working on like

2528
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,800
different parts of the product and

2529
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,719
sometimes you know they forget to sync

2530
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:31,520
up right um and therefore you know we

2531
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,199
allowed it in recommendations but we

2532
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,880
should have taken it down

2533
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,320
et cetera et cetera like there are a lot

2534
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:37,920
of places for these things to go wrong

2535
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,800
and so i guess the complexity of it

2536
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,920
of how content moderation is done um it

2537
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,679
just seems to me that having like a very

2538
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,840
blunt statement around hey like you know

2539
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:50,159
you messed up and therefore like you

2540
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,000
don't get all of these privileges it

2541
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,600
just seems like a very difficult

2542
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,560
conversation and that means that um you

2543
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,679
know the really risk averse among us

2544
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:01,760
um would not even want to start delving

2545
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:03,280
into that world at all and i think

2546
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,280
that's really bad for the internet yeah

2547
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,440
i think there's a it's a really really

2548
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,360
good point and i know we're we're

2549
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,960
beginning we're getting close to the end

2550
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,080
here so it's actually a really good

2551
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,679
point i think to emphasize because it

2552
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,440
hasn't been discussed as much which is

2553
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,120
like so much of this discussion is

2554
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,639
always focused on like the take up leave

2555
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:21,360
down aspect and that's you know less and

2556
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,639
less

2557
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,639
important in some sense to to content

2558
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,480
moderation and the fact that you have

2559
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,080
all these these different solutions or

2560
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,679
you have things you know which is really

2561
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:31,679
only become common in the last couple

2562
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:34,880
years where you know uh companies are

2563
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,360
adding more information right so like

2564
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,199
you know putting a flag on content that

2565
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,920
this might be misleading um or you know

2566
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,639
putting a a an interstitial tool that

2567
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:45,920
shows up like do you really want to

2568
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,440
share this you know this has been known

2569
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,600
to mislead other people or or something

2570
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,600
along those lines or you know employing

2571
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,360
fact checkers you know all of this kind

2572
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,440
of kind of stuff is there there are

2573
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,960
different approaches and it's section

2574
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,600
230 that allows for this variety of

2575
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,000
approaches that allows for this you know

2576
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,080
broader ecosystem of possible

2577
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,040
interventions beyond just leave up take

2578
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,800
down shut down this account or or

2579
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,000
whatever um and you know i know like

2580
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,120
eric goldman who we all know uh and love

2581
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,719
had put out a paper

2582
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,679
uh i guess about a year ago of like all

2583
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,760
the different interventions beyond leave

2584
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,040
up and take down i forget what the

2585
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,480
paper's called but i think it has like

2586
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,239
leave up take beyond leave up take down

2587
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,719
or something like that um where he looks

2588
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,000
at you know and just sort of like

2589
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,840
creates a sort of taxonomy of like

2590
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,560
there's so many different options

2591
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,480
and if you had a world in which there

2592
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,320
was like product liability or potential

2593
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,800
of negligence for the choices what would

2594
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,280
happen realistically is that there would

2595
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,600
probably be a few big lawsuits

2596
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,000
and courts would determine this is okay

2597
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,600
if you do this it's okay and then

2598
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,880
everybody would follow that path to

2599
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,639
avoid legal liability and you wouldn't

2600
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,159
get all this experimentation you

2601
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,760
wouldn't get all this variety you

2602
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,040
wouldn't get different platforms trying

2603
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,080
different things for different

2604
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,600
communities and sort of matching what

2605
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:00,480
makes sense for the different

2606
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,400
communities so i think it's it's really

2607
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,480
important to sort of to recognize how

2608
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,000
much section 230 allows for the

2609
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,800
experimentation and the the sort of you

2610
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,120
know iteration as as we go through this

2611
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,280
and as these companies try and improve

2612
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,360
and try to to provide different you know

2613
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:17,040
different results for for different

2614
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,159
services

2615
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:21,040
and with that i think we are out of time

2616
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,040
