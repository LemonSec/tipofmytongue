1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,160
in security we have a lot of different

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
teams we have red teams we have blue

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,639
teams purple teams this talk is about

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,400
the security team that few people think

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,359
about

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,640
but that has

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,720
the potential to be the most influential

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
security team in the organization and

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,039
that's the board of directors

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,560
if you think that the board has little

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,720
to do with security then this talk is

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,039
for you so

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,040
a lot of people think that the ceo is

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,079
the most important person or the

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,079
the

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,520
one who's ultimately in charge of the

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,440
organization but that's not the case for

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
public companies

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
there the board of directors is actually

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
above the ceo and they

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,399
represent the shareholders in ensuring

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
that the objectives of the organization

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,399
are met that it's on course

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,480
and boards are powerful because they can

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,640
among other things direct the budget of

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,000
the organization

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,760
and they can set their priorities for

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,280
the organization

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,680
they can set the risk tolerance for the

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,560
organization and that includes security

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,080
risk

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
and they can hire or fire the ceo and by

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,400
extension

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,799
the cso

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,400
and so any one of these reasons makes

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,640
the board

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,880
a very powerful potential ally for the

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,479
cso

39
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,080
historically though

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
the board has

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
would no sooner concern itself with

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,640
information security than they would

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,200
with say janitorial services

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
but there's been a number of trends that

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
have happened recently that have changed

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
slowly changed the board's view towards

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,000
security and the first one is the number

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,880
of high-profile breaches in the news

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,600
affecting virtually every industry

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,119
and

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,640
this has gotten the attention of boards

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,079
of directors

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,000
and it's clear today than ever before

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
that security is an enterprise risk that

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,719
security threats can

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,799
put at risk the ability of a business to

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,640
perform its business operations or even

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,399
to stay in business

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,520
and

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,000
the board's job is to oversee enterprise

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,800
risk so the second trend

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,080
are an increasing number of regulations

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
that strongly encourage boards or

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,360
acquire boards

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
to actively oversee security

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,879
as part of their risk oversight function

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,040
so these two trends have

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,959
literally brought the cso into the

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,239
boardroom

70
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
but unfortunately in many cases

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,920
neither board or board directors nor

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
csos are fully prepared for this moment

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,840
and this is for

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
a few reasons

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,720
first

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
for boards many still lack cyber

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,360
security expertise

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
for example a survey of over 500

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,720
board directors

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,879
of public companies found that 40

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,080
percent of them thought that their

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,319
boards didn't know enough about security

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,360
to effectively provide

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,519
to provide oversight

85
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,360
now the second reason is that many csos

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
still don't know how to effectively

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
engage the board

88
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,200
and as evidence of this in my

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,840
conversations with the cso the gartner

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,239
ceso coalition and other practice groups

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,280
the topic of how should csos engage the

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
board is of perennial interest it's a

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
very strong interest

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
among cisos to answer this question

95
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,519
and so given these knowledge gaps

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
the problem of how the cso should engage

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,799
with the board

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,280
is one of the unsolved problems in

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,120
security and there's very little

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
research in this area and that's why

101
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,599
myself my colleagues are working to do

102
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
research to understand how can the csos

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
better engage their boards of directors

104
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,239
so the purpose of this talk is to share

105
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,920
some highlights of what we've found so

106
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,519
far

107
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
in talking with board directors and csos

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,519
and others

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,959
and talk about some of the problems that

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,360
have surfaced and also about

111
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
some of the solutions or suggestions

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959
that have worked in things that haven't

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,040
worked

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
right so our method was an in-depth

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
field study

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,079
we have so far interviewed over 32

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,358
board directors and csos and consultants

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,320
who

119
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
first of all work for public companies

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,440
for u.s based companies

121
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,840
and consultants who specialize in

122
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,479
supporting csos and boards of directors

123
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,240
in security

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
and as you can imagine this is kind of a

125
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
difficult group to get access to their

126
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,720
time is limited it's valuable

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,639
but people have been very generous and

128
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,560
these interviews have lasted about an

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,880
hour each and so these aren't short

130
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
opinion surveys they're in-depth

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,240
in-depth discussions

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,240
and so far we have a lot of data we have

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
over 550

134
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
transcript pages from these interviews

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
and we've spent over 300 hours

136
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
reading these line by line analyzing

137
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,840
them for interesting patterns

138
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
so for example we go through this data

139
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,720
we code interesting findings

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,440
we see how they relate to patterns and

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,680
then also overarching themes and the

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
rest of this talk will be arranged

143
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,000
around

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
three

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,160
overarching themes that

146
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
that are that i think are pretty

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,639
impactful for csos so the first one is

148
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,400
that the cso title

149
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
doesn't necessarily grant credibility

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
for the cso with the board

151
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,039
and by credibility i mean that the board

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,120
doesn't necessarily see the cso as a

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,840
strategic partner

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,560
sometimes a hire is lured in by higher

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,880
salary or by a title but that doesn't

156
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,120
necessarily guarantee respect or

157
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,520
influence in the organization

158
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
for many

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,759
security is still seen as the technical

160
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,120
cleanup crew

161
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
they see

162
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
the security team as the place where

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,199
they should go to get no because they're

164
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,440
often told by security teams that they

165
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
can't do certain things and they see the

166
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
cso as dr no

167
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,960
and this is part of the perception that

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,199
csos still need to to fight against at

169
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
the executive level and at the board

170
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,560
level

171
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,400
and so some csos after they're hired may

172
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,720
not be aware that they're brought in to

173
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,000
satisfy regulatory requirements or to

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,759
improve the company's

175
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,520
public perception

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
rather than to be a true collaborator

177
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,479
with the board and so as a result

178
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
many board members or many csos find

179
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,960
themselves outside of these quote

180
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
unquote closed door meetings where

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
strategic decisions are made and

182
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
excluded from similar board meetings

183
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
where high-level discussions are made so

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
in other words

185
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,120
the board of directors is not

186
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,639
necessarily going to roll out a red

187
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,800
carpet for the cso

188
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,599
instead the cso will have to earn that

189
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,319
by establishing their own credibility

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,720
but fortunately the second theme that we

191
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
found in this in our discussions is that

192
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
credibility can be built over time

193
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
through engagement with the board

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,639
so some csos may feel that they don't

195
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,680
have

196
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
opportunities to engage with the board

197
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,039
perhaps because they never report to the

198
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,440
board or maybe they're layered so far

199
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,120
down in the organization that they just

200
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
don't have the opportunity to engage at

201
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,520
least on a regular basis some may report

202
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,720
to the board

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,840
maybe 15 minutes on an annual basis and

204
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
that's just not enough to

205
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,479
to move the security program forward in

206
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,880
organizations so it's

207
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,599
like a chicken and the egg problem where

208
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,120
you have to engage with the board and

209
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,960
educate them so that they can be aware

210
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,759
of and appreciate security risks but

211
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,520
until they appreciate security risks

212
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
they're not going to want to grant the

213
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,879
cso access to the board

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
however although a lot of csos think

215
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,360
they don't have access to the board

216
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,639
directly

217
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,360
in fact they do indirectly through a

218
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
dotted line

219
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
and perhaps they have to work through

220
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,400
the ceo or through another established

221
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,280
role through approved channels but the

222
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,440
point is that the cso needs to be the

223
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,479
one who is proactively establishing

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,440
the relationship with the board

225
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
and this is really important because the

226
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,919
board oversees enterprise risk which

227
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,919
includes security risk

228
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,919
the board can't do their job unless the

229
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,360
cso is

230
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
actively engaging with them

231
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,599
so don't wait to be called on don't wait

232
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,280
for your name to show up on the agenda

233
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,399
instead

234
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,080
look for opportunities to engage the

235
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,640
board and we've found in this data that

236
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,000
there's a really interesting pattern of

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,880
a virtuous cycle where through increased

238
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
engagement

239
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,959
the board sees

240
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
value in working with the cso and gives

241
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
the cso more support which leads to even

242
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,200
more engagement

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
with the cso

244
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
let me describe some of the tips that we

245
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
saw in our data about how csos can

246
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
engage the board and gain their

247
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
credibility

248
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
so the first one is to negotiate access

249
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
with the board going in if you're a new

250
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,880
hire ask will i have access to the board

251
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,880
can i

252
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,959
through the cso or some other designated

253
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,839
role can i proactively educate them and

254
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,279
inform them about

255
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,080
things we're doing and security events

256
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,240
in the news that may impact the company

257
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
another is another tip is to ask is to

258
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,640
find out what

259
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
makes each board member tick

260
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,560
learn about their background their

261
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,320
industry

262
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
determine each board member's level of

263
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,640
technical experience and that may not

264
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
include their cyber their security

265
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,200
expertise

266
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,920
one way to do this is to ask the

267
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,360
security teams at organizations

268
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,279
where that cisa where that board member

269
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,279
works or where that board member also

270
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,519
serves on a board and ask those security

271
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,920
teams at those other organizations

272
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,519
what experiences have you had what

273
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,839
security incidents have you seen for

274
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,519
example if there was a significant

275
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,120
ransomware event

276
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,880
that can really color

277
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,200
a board member's outlook and that's

278
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,360
important to know what experiences these

279
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
war member board members have had in

280
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,600
other places

281
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,399
another

282
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,839
tip is to

283
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
build relationships with stakeholders

284
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
so many csos may see their stakeholders

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,920
as their direct reports for example the

286
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
cio or the cfo for example

287
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
but there are many other people

288
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
who interface with the board

289
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,760
for example general counsel or head of

290
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,160
hr or many other roles and each one of

291
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
these people can potentially be a

292
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,200
channel or avenue to indirectly interact

293
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,959
with the board and this is why many

294
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,760
people see the building of relationships

295
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,320
as one of the most important tasks for a

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,040
cso to accomplish and it should be part

297
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
of the job description and oftentimes

298
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
it's not

299
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,839
another tip is to proactively share

300
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,200
information with the board if there's a

301
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,959
security event in the news

302
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,760
that may have bearing on the company

303
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,640
or

304
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
may be of interest to the board to

305
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,200
proactively prepare something to provide

306
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,519
to the board before they contact you and

307
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,920
ask questions

308
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,760
and periodically check in with the board

309
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
collectively as well as individually to

310
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,600
share this type of information

311
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,560
and similarly similarly to pre-arm the

312
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,760
ceo if an event happens to say

313
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
you may get asked questions by the board

314
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
about this event this is how it could

315
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,240
affect us or this is why it wouldn't

316
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
affect us this is why it doesn't apply

317
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
but i'm going to pre-arm you anyway with

318
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,480
these these talking points and by doing

319
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
this

320
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,800
you're more likely to be seen by the ceo

321
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
as a counselor as someone as a resource

322
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,880
that this ceo can go to if

323
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,399
they're asked questions by the board

324
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,680
that they don't have the answers to

325
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,800
and this final tip which i love is

326
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
for your security team to become the

327
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,079
board's

328
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,360
geek squad

329
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
say

330
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,160
to the ceo i'm i'm the new ciso here i

331
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,120
want to to provide a service to

332
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
the board i want to send a couple people

333
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,880
from my security team to check out the

334
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,839
security of the board members social

335
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,680
media accounts for example are they

336
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,279
using two-factor authentication or

337
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,040
something like that

338
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,839
and

339
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,839
one of the indications that this type of

340
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,560
approach is working is if

341
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,399
you're contacted by a board member who

342
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,959
says that their granddaughter's facebook

343
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,639
account was hacked and they want you to

344
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,720
fix it even though you don't work for

345
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,200
facebook

346
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,040
and this might seem like a menial task

347
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
for a cso but it's valuable because it

348
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,279
shows that one the board thought of you

349
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,480
as a resource

350
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,839
and two they think you can fix it

351
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,360
and even if you can't fix it you can

352
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,560
explain to them what's going on

353
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
so once csos have established

354
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,839
a communication channel with a board how

355
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,600
should they communicate and either

356
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,519
presenting or in writing

357
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
and here's a few points that emerge from

358
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,240
our data

359
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,200
one is to explain the risk in context of

360
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,240
the business

361
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,160
so this could involve using

362
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,959
mba speak but that's just part of it

363
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,200
a bigger issue is to understand this

364
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
particular business your particular

365
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,800
business and how security risk

366
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,240
influences

367
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
the business and its revenue streams for

368
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,320
example

369
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
another is to

370
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,839
understand what motivates the board

371
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
so we as security professionals love

372
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
threat reports like this because they're

373
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,800
compelling and they have very

374
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
interesting data but what motivates

375
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,920
security professionals like us

376
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,079
will not necessarily motivate the board

377
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,519
in fact this is

378
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,120
a level of detail that they're probably

379
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,639
not interested in and that you should

380
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,360
avoid going to this level of detail for

381
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
example when cso said that it took him a

382
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,519
long time to realize

383
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,160
that the board just doesn't care about

384
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
my vulnerable vulnerability management

385
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,800
program they really don't

386
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
and that's because the board's not at

387
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
the operational level they're at the

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
governance level so instead they care

389
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,839
about things like is the security

390
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,519
program under control or not is

391
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,279
the maturity of the security program

392
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,320
improving or not is the cso

393
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,480
accomplishing goals on

394
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,959
their roadmap

395
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,120
another point is to not use fear it's

396
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,279
really easy to talk fear

397
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,120
it's difficult to talk

398
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
results

399
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,120
in what you're doing and it's much more

400
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,639
effective to actually explain what

401
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,199
you're doing to show progress than it is

402
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,199
to spend a lot of time saying if we

403
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,480
don't do this

404
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,519
this really bad thing can happen

405
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
because eventually the board will will

406
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
tune you out and you as a cso will lose

407
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
credibility

408
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
one cesa we spoke with

409
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,519
is very careful to never use fear as a

410
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:58,720
lever

411
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,480
and at the end of one presentation to

412
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
the board a board member made this

413
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,760
comment which i think is really

414
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,240
interesting she said

415
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
i sit on a lot of boards and it's very

416
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,279
refreshing that you recognize the risk

417
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,279
but you're not creating fear instead

418
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,800
you're telling us about what you're

419
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,680
doing

420
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,360
to address the risk and you're giving us

421
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,639
confidence that you're doing the right

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,880
things

423
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,320
once the cso gains the trust of the

424
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
board built a relationship with the

425
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,639
board

426
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,480
they can serve as a coach and this i

427
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
think is fascinating because you don't

428
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,000
see this with any other executive

429
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,199
relationship

430
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,880
the board doesn't need to be coached on

431
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
how to understand financial statements

432
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,000
but the board does need to be coached on

433
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
security fundamentals and how those

434
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,759
fundamentals influence the business

435
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
and this can happen in a number of ways

436
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,600
for example

437
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,759
c sales provide what they call security

438
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,320
101 training where they talk about

439
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
security fundamentals to provide a

440
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,800
common baseline or common understanding

441
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
for all the board members

442
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,880
they may talk about security events that

443
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,199
occur in the news and contextualize

444
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,360
those events and explain how they may or

445
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
may not relate to the business

446
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,759
over time these kinds of training

447
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,360
sessions can

448
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,680
significantly improve the board's

449
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,279
sophistication

450
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,800
in security

451
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,759
whereas one ciso said in the beginning

452
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,440
it was a very elementary level of

453
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,199
understanding now they ask me

454
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,319
sophisticated questions

455
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,800
another form of coaching is just to set

456
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,759
realistic expectations

457
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,160
to say

458
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,639
for example with a security maturity

459
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,880
model to say our organization actually

460
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,639
should be a three and not a five and

461
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,160
this is why

462
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
or one ciso explained

463
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,160
the nist cyber security framework and

464
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,839
said this is what a good security

465
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,800
program should look like

466
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,040
these types of things of

467
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
of helping boards understand what good

468
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
is and what isn't

469
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
but the problem is that a lot of csos

470
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,559
just aren't capable

471
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,640
of performing this coaching role and

472
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,079
this can be for

473
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,480
various reasons but one typical one is

474
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,760
that they're too technical and they

475
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,439
can't translate

476
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,799
security concepts into business impacts

477
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,039
and another is they just can't develop a

478
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,919
rapport with the board for example one

479
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
cso explained why his predecessor was

480
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,480
fired for this very reason he said

481
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
that the previous ciso was never able to

482
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,880
connect with the board they never gained

483
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,200
the confidence of the board

484
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
and the reason why they didn't gain that

485
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
is because they couldn't they couldn't

486
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,840
speak the business language they spoke a

487
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
technical language and it created a

488
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
barrier that this individual was never

489
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,840
able to

490
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,360
overcome and even though the previous

491
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
ciso was

492
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,720
technically more accomplished and more

493
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,200
experienced in cyber security than this

494
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,919
current cso is

495
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,360
that the board's not looking for that

496
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,559
they're looking for someone who

497
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,640
understands business risk and can

498
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,880
translate these security risks into

499
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
terms that the board can appreciate

500
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,039
and that can interact with and

501
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,760
collaborate with the board

502
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,360
so the final theme i want to share with

503
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,480
you is the power that comes

504
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,120
when the board is engaged with a cso

505
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,280
this can come in terms of raising the

506
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,039
csos budget

507
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
the board directing this

508
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,720
to raising the attention from the

509
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,919
c-suite because executives see that the

510
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,520
board is interested in cyber security

511
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
because they're being asked by the board

512
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,960
about cyber security then suddenly the

513
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,760
executives are meeting with the cso more

514
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,720
often including the the ceo

515
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
and they can importantly back up the

516
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,840
ciso so one cso explained at this

517
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
this instance where

518
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,760
the executive team wanted to roll out a

519
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,799
product

520
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,440
over significant concerns from the cso

521
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
and the executive team just decided to

522
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,080
accept the risk

523
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,400
the cso presented this to the board

524
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
the same information

525
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
and he said that i never had the

526
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
political capital to make executives

527
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,840
address certain things

528
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,440
whereas the board looked at the same

529
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,960
information

530
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,120
and was able to say to the executive we

531
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
don't care about

532
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
your release schedule go fix the

533
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
vulnerability

534
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,559
and this is the kind of power that c

535
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,240
cells can only dream of

536
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
this is the kind of

537
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,200
support that csos need in organizations

538
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
at critical times and that's what the

539
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,120
board can provide

540
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,559
so

541
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,559
my main takeaways for you today is that

542
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,360
the cso title isn't enough that

543
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,400
regulatory pressure isn't enough

544
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
to

545
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,919
grant the cso credibility with the board

546
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,960
that has to be gained over time

547
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,400
through interaction

548
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
but that there is this way of developing

549
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,799
credibility with the board through these

550
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,200
micro engagements with the board by

551
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
working with them by sharing information

552
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
and that over time the cso can become a

553
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,799
trusted partner of the board

554
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,919
and the third theme is that

555
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,159
boards can become an immense resource

556
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,760
for the cso i've shown just a few

557
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,600
examples of this but there are many more

558
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,080
where the board can provide a

559
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,919
level of support that is not available

560
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,360
anywhere else in the organization

561
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,000
including at the executive level

562
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
so this research is ongoing

563
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,919
there's lots that i haven't shared if

564
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,360
you'd like to know more about this then

565
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,400
please

566
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,679
contact me

567
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,919
in slack or email

568
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,400
or twitter and i'd be happy to share

569
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
more information with you

570
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,679
and i'll just leave you with this this

571
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,559
point and that is in many organizations

572
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,679
the board

573
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,960
the board is still an untapped resource

574
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
in driving security in the organization

575
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,440
from the top down and the board needs

576
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
your help as security professionals to

577
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,840
help them realize their potential

578
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
as the most powerful security team in

579
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,080
the organization

580
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,600
thanks

581
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,570
[Applause]

582
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,600
you
