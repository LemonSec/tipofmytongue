1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
thanks man

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,879
well good morning everybody

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:12,489
great appreciate coming out i think is
my fourth

4
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,510
before I

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,358
in the video but I really I made a video
tape parade is the effort that obviously

6
00:00:53,359 --> 00:01:01,219
April Fools right so it would be a video
I wanted to show its pretty funny and so

7
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:10,009
the media industry right and the things
that make things better at a lot of

8
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:16,310
things happen a lot of things are
happening

9
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:40,380
yet rated

10
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:54,700
get anything about that but it's what we
gonna put on it and it can be tried and

11
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:02,979
trusted and binder defense companies
that are now and stop talking about that

12
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:14,450
kind of things that we're finding out
there it's a global issue which is

13
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,039
really interesting and it hits every
single industry protocol which is unique

14
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,919
to our industry and in nineteen general
means that as a security person I can

15
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,070
find a job and manufacturing I can find
a job in financial I can find a job in

16
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:32,479
healthcare and has no real you know
threshold for us not to find jobs in

17
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,490
certain areas in this industry is
growing so fast now there's not enough

18
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,250
talent for us to be able to support the
current trends that we see today and so

19
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,870
you look at that as a whole you're in a
very unique you know type of industry

20
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,570
there's a lot of great things happening
in this industry to make things better

21
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,159
so you know if you look at at just
hacking in general and and just looking

22
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,780
at the security industry in general
there's a lot of things that we're doing

23
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,020
that really make a difference

24
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,419
around the globe and what we're trying
to do to combat those and so what's

25
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:05,159
interesting is when I when I left being
a chief security officer in starting

26
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,500
trusted Sekai no idea how that was going
to actually go and the industry itself

27
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,419
just boom so fast and so big in a lot of
areas that you know if you do the right

28
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:20,900
things you'll make a difference and I'll
talk about that only be seen this this

29
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:27,310
is a little interview that her by her
defense that we did around our offices

30
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,889
and what we do in kind of how we do it
but if you're interested in going to

31
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:32,490
feel this is one of the videos that we
did on the kind of show that I wanted to

32
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,430
show this really just all about peter
has a lot of ways that you can get into

33
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,080
a corporation

34
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,560
on this phone that allows you to move
your phone number call up tech support

35
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,550
from their company's number and say hey
i'm bob and I need help I can get to

36
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,389
this website and I T person trying to be
helpful will go to website click a link

37
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,680
and it actually has her computer and
takes full control of it so it's not

38
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,219
just all about the computer hacking
skills it's also about how you

39
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:08,280
communicate founder and chief technology
officer defense system by her defense

40
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,500
systems a company that focuses energy of
a security operations and you have to

41
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,319
have a map map that has you know like
threats and you're looking like you

42
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,849
actually doing something that does
absolutely nothing so you have no

43
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:25,520
looking at how hackers get into
corporations and were 24 7 365 company

44
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,698
that looks at at the different types of
attacks that are happening we try to

45
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,500
defend against hackers going into big
corporations and financial systems banks

46
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,140
you know manufacturing companies you
know folks that make you know that

47
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,319
energy that we deal with on a regular
basis over here is what we're actually

48
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,380
monitoring as far as what we consider
assets using machines that were actively

49
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,029
monitoring the meantime what happens
here is ready tracking different groups

50
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,589
and threats throughout the world you can
actually see over this diagram the

51
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:56,510
difference if we are to something i
guess im in my focus is making sure that

52
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,990
companies understand what the risks are
and how they can best defend against it

53
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,670
you know part of that as is the minor in
peace you're looking for what hackers

54
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,449
are doing but also understanding what
their exposures are in so and I get to

55
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:11,079
be a hacker for life and I go into court
companies I i hack into computer systems

56
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:20,420
I steal money credit cards I still
people's numbers so sorry no it was

57
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,479
interesting is when I started off I had
no idea that there was going to be a

58
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,000
security industry and so as a kid when I
when I was in high school I was

59
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,600
overweight you know and on ocular kid
that I like to play video games and it

60
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,320
was kind of my thing and back in my time
I guess and it's weird seeing my time

61
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,779
but I couldn't have like really
graphical games like we have today right

62
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,170
you know we have these things called
much they're called multiuser dimensions

63
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,660
and they were text based game you
literally type like kill somebody or you

64
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,760
know bash somebody or go north

65
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,750
type North right and so there's no like
mouse and stuff that you used to do all

66
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,510
of us are you actually typing all this
stuff right and so I started off with

67
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,620
mud and that's actually how I started to
learn a little bit of programming I

68
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,660
started to build my own mind and started
to learn a little bit of C C++ to

69
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,910
actually build this modern member my dad
you go to work every day at 8:30 my bus

70
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,480
would come and pick me up at like eight
so what I would do is hide in the woods

71
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,240
from like 8 830 until I see his car
drive by then I go back to my house and

72
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,970
play videogames all day when it gets
cool you know so you know i i didnt

73
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,950
really excel very well at school which
was interesting

74
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,530
a role model well that's a funny story
then a second but I never ever really

75
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,339
enjoyed school because it didn't really
focused on what I want to do as a person

76
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,840
which was more in the technology side
it's funny because I i literally filled

77
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,040
out of high school I got D's and F's in
season I had to take summer school just

78
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,310
a graduate and so what's funny is I got
nominated accepted for my graduate from

79
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,910
high school I got nominated accepted
into their lane and so it was

80
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,160
interesting when you get except in the
Hall of Fame is the asking all these

81
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,620
questions like a what was your GPA Mike
no comments you know you know hey what

82
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,200
what sports did you play no comment you
know it's you know what was your

83
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,960
favorite thing at school I didn't really
go to school so I don't put it right you

84
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,580
know and then you like but hey you know
what you know what are things you do as

85
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,570
far as like extracurricular activities
in school every part of the band I do

86
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,770
know that none of that none of that and
so I don't think I'm going to accept it

87
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,140
and I did but it goes to show you that I
mean you know schools one thing and you

88
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,370
definitely should be focusing on it but
I focus on your interest in what you

89
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,840
enjoy doing and afterwards I went to
college and finish everything else but

90
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,600
you know the beginning for me was was a
bit rough because I didn't really know

91
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,590
what I wanted to do I just wanted to do
technology just want to do something and

92
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,260
i tis I don't know what that was and I
enjoyed the hacking stuff I remember

93
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:57,140
trying to find a source code for a mud
on IRC for some guy gave me an exe and I

94
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,020
downloaded and installed in the sub
seven Trojan as the first time ever got

95
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,880
hacked on my Windows 98 machine or
whatever so you know all these things

96
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,930
that you start to learn as a kid growing
up and say look at the field and so I

97
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,180
decided to join the military was
interesting story about going into the

98
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,109
Marines was was weird because I knew I
just didn't like school I don't want to

99
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,450
go to college and it wasn't for me but
you know getting into a job or whatever

100
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,900
I don't know what that meant some nyquil
it is going to join the military and see

101
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,410
what happens from there and I literally
was about the sign on the dotted line to

102
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,969
join the army and some in the recruiting
station to go into an army and the Army

103
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,990
recruiters are just complaining about
how the heat their day-to-day job and

104
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,450
also said it's not a regular army
recruiter that we're there are kind of

105
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:48,250
like a minister Thaksin but I want to
sign up for this and so make thinking

106
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,730
you know second guessing myself and
whether or not even want to join the

107
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,660
military I see these three marines you
know walking in with a dress blues and

108
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,230
they're all like you know ripped and
everything and I'm not overweight kid

109
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,460
and also their stuff and start walking
through like wow I wanna be those guys

110
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,870
right and so I went to join the Marines
and started and shipped out the boot

111
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,820
camp and all that good stuff

112
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:14,740
shortly after getting into the Marines
deployed to Bahrain and we spent a lot

113
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,420
time I had a lot of intelligence work so
a lot of things that helped a lot of

114
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,000
that the terrorists we saw especially
during Operation Enduring Freedom during

115
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,930
the specific time but I gotta got to
learn a lot on the tax side what was

116
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,189
interesting as I did a lot of thing I
did I T work like being a sysadmin so I

117
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,930
got a lot of good foundation of
networking and everything else I was out

118
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,430
there shortly after I got back from here
I got brought into a group called the

119
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,989
computer network operations team which
is more of their their early form of

120
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,850
their hacking team if they had the
military and I started to learn a little

121
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,700
bit more on the offensive side and
because I had some a little bit security

122
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,320
knack I was able to actually go and do
that I'm not going anywhere I'm actually

123
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,750
right here right

124
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:12,760
we're here using more than anything but
it was funny because you know our

125
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,730
mentality you know was you know
especially Intel is like the exact

126
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,480
opposite the Marine Corps so that we
draw here are you know it would be like

127
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,560
the traditional marines you'd like
considered like that the Pirates of the

128
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,760
group over there but shortly after I got
back I then again deployed to Iraq and I

129
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,150
spent a lot of time over there this is
one of the first marine units into Iraq

130
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,860
or you know as as the actual wars going
on which was interesting for testing

131
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,600
army unit at the time in some Brits and
we went in and the Green Zone that the

132
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,630
Green Zone where saddam hussein a lot of
stuff was but I want to go and I just

133
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,750
got to see a lot of things over there
but I was over there was doing a lot of

134
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,330
friends ex works like a lot of good
friends experience like you know looking

135
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,180
at hard drives and things like that and
doing analysis of those and so hard to

136
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,949
get a little more on the defensive side
of things and then what's the point that

137
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,670
a second time and I was focusing more on
on wireless collection actually hacking

138
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,199
into signals and things like that so I
got a good broad set of experience

139
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,120
well as over there kind of understanding
things and that's your for me was was

140
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,030
really helpful

141
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,459
the military in general it was extremely
helpful because he gave me a foundation

142
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:25,380
of Networking Foundation no offensive
Wireless you know protocols you know all

143
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,050
those things that you really need to
kind of build on yourself off and so

144
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:35,150
once I got outta here I decided it was
time to you know going to the private

145
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,089
sector and get out of the military and
that's all I did five years in the

146
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:43,730
Marines and then I decided to join a
company in Cleveland and consulting and

147
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,690
consulting is an interesting one because
it really burns you out very quickly but

148
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,430
you learn in an insane amount of
information so consulting you're getting

149
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,410
shipped out all the time you're going to
different customers you're flying by the

150
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,319
seat of your pants you're doing all of
this work and at the same time we're

151
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,850
learning more and more because
everything that you're touching is

152
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,200
completely new and unique every
organization you go to is completely

153
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,290
different than the one you just in the
past every attack background not every

154
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,699
tactic but the attack vectors you have
to learn different things to actually

155
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,089
going to do and so while this was a very

156
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:18,300
good learning time of where I was at the
company I was with wasn't so good as far

157
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,729
as where I came from and kind of that
ethics behind it and everything else so

158
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,420
I didn't have a good time with that but
it gave me so many so much experience

159
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,769
that I was more than invaluable to its
what I was actually able to accomplish

160
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:34,139
and so during this time was interesting
was the first time that I ever presented

161
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:39,319
in front of public and was at a local
security conference in in Cleveland and

162
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,779
remember I had no idea it was just a
young kid on the military and it was

163
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,459
like a more like a corporate event like
you know they got hasty shows and stuff

164
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:49,800
like that right

165
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,748
thinking like 2005 and my whole talk was
like on packet injection wireless and

166
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:57,579
cracking WEP and WPA or something like
that right it was all technical and

167
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:01,769
people are like who is this guy talking
about you know and you know and so does

168
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:05,189
come my first lesson of actually
presenting and then shortly after that

169
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:09,010
are presented at DEFCON which was one of
the highlights of my life from that side

170
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,730
and presented it shook on which is
another highlight of my life and

171
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,860
actually presenting at and i doing those
things and it was interesting in the

172
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:22,359
consulting front is there's a guy named
honey months he runs offensive security

173
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:27,619
Cali Linux and other stuff and I was in
IRC chatroom months and months was like

174
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,760
hey I was talking about a month you know
if if you had to pick one programming

175
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,779
language and he wanted to advance your
skills what would you do much like have

176
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:40,429
recommended pick up ice on so much for
me to pick up by then it sort of Python

177
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:45,690
and that day is when I started writing a
tool called fast track and also the

178
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,260
first program I really never written in
my life and I just think of an idea and

179
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,629
go into it so I started writing this
post or no idea how to write in the

180
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,980
first interaction all the horrible but
what they call it was like literally

181
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,309
trikes up blocks and like hey if this
doesn't work then just accept air and

182
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:08,210
they keep going on right and then to
bring order to have actually literally

183
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,390
been trying to Lake remove the code from
the internet and then I actually wrote

184
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,250
in to set so that it actually look
decent with proper functions

185
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,370
things like that right there is not a
single function in an entire

186
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:22,040
applications like it literally was like
six thousand lines of trucks and wheels

187
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,850
one file

188
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:28,209
rights with that but I was my first
program ever ever wrote that was

189
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,910
something that I was able to go on
presents at doc on on and the first time

190
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:37,650
representative con what would happen all
my dad was in work right every single

191
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,710
one of them failed right horrible worst
experience ever and actually blackout

192
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,990
and I don't even think about that one
anymore so bad but you know you pick

193
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,610
yourself up and you move on and you do a
good job in another time and I did the

194
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,669
same thing and I attempted to demagogic
controversy was successful

195
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,810
so the consulting front for me was was
probably the start of my my real career

196
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,200
guess in the security industry because I
was able to kind of get out there and

197
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,720
start talking and share things that I
was doing that's really important for

198
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,840
you in this industry right now is that
you know there's there's so many

199
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,949
different angles you can focus on and
learn that finding that that's cool said

200
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,970
that your data and sharing your
knowledge sharing information what this

201
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,260
community is all about and so going into
this field and going into the consulting

202
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,820
sign the private sector and was able to
write things like that record help

203
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,810
people you know people are actually
using it to going back and doing things

204
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,460
the right way people and doing all these
other things and so you know it was

205
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,120
something that I really enjoyed now as
part of this space for me when I started

206
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,469
doing consulting network a lot of people
became good friends a lot of folks and

207
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,390
so after about us there for about five
years I decided it was time to go and

208
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,540
and and take the next step and one
important thing about being in this

209
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,200
industry is communication you can't
communicate you can talk very difficult

210
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,410
exceeding in can move forward and so we
can be very technical technical you want

211
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,340
to do you have to have a communication
skills and so I decided to leave and

212
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,760
join a company called evil as a chief
security officer and it was interesting

213
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,660
because you know devotees 22,000
employees company and at the time I was

214
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,850
the youngest VP and evil history to
actually joined the company itself and

215
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,250
so I decided to actually go and and
build a program there never done it

216
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,790
before it's not something that I was
used on the offensive side

217
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,809
it was funny that the first few weeks
that I was working there I want to learn

218
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:35,200
the network and understand everything
and it's funny because they had a

219
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,929
dashboard at the meeting which is that
aidid you know change control the head

220
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,580
and one of those that the security teams
providing at the time was the top

221
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,259
threats in the company and so as a top
threat for like the next two years after

222
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:54,799
that is on the top of the hacking and
everything nice about being there is

223
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,480
that I was able to figure out how to
build a good program I started off with

224
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,519
about three people on my team and I
quickly went to about 64 people I think

225
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,279
but then the days when I end up leaving
and the best part about that was the

226
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,590
communication pieces in the
communication skills that I learned from

227
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,379
that but what's funny about what you do
not talk about this at the latter part

228
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:20,990
of my slides is that when you go to a
certain place and they have a specific

229
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,129
culture that doesn't mean that you have
to adhere to that culture when I went to

230
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:27,549
TBell very old company right

231
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:31,690
hundred and fifty years or whatever you
know ties and you know suit coats and

232
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,159
also their stuff right now I came there
I should call it up I was wearing jeans

233
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,129
and a t-shirt with a lot to you know

234
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,939
against each other or whatever and I
still did it and we had you know her

235
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,330
phone wars and things that were
completely unheard of at that company

236
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,529
but I quickly changed the culture there
especially in our area and I see folks

237
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:52,769
if you want to be more relaxed and i can
understand how to work together in

238
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,820
through the come together as a team and
certainly change the culture there and a

239
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,240
lot of cases for the better and I got
only the same time ever Erica Erica here

240
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,000
yet so I hired lara is when I was

241
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,320
people and one of that one of the best
times I remember being there is likely

242
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,850
they come in and done all this physical
security working you know we have

243
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,800
security guards and you know all these
other things right and i think is

244
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,730
nickerson figure out a way to like Jimmy
the door open a little bit in the use of

245
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,460
copper wiring or some some copper wire
to get to the other side as I conducted

246
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,130
crash bar and you touch it and ethical
Tricity causes the crash more depressing

247
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,040
than open the door and wire long enough
to get to this this one side and

248
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,530
generate static electricity this hand
open the door to get in our building and

249
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,980
then from there you know their garden
doing anything they're just sitting

250
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,620
there like waving at the thing I try to
figure like hey we're here and nothing

251
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,550
happened so it's a good learning lesson
for me to get better and get stuff but

252
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,960
as a as a chief security officer of a
company you know there's a lot of things

253
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,210
that you learn politics you have to be
friends with people you have to make

254
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,630
friends and if you don't agree with what
they're doing they're certain exceptions

255
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,520
that you have to do to allow and it was
interesting is that I got very lucky

256
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,010
because the chief

257
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,140
CEO the company tama time was extremely
awesome understanding that we had a lot

258
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:21,000
of risks and things that we're doing so
I really enjoyed that while is outside

259
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,040
the Apple started with a bunch of my
friends and Derby Conn was was really

260
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,050
that the store manager because this is
kind of interesting we all learned he

261
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,760
decided that he wanted to hold a little
free get together for folks to learn

262
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,500
medicine and so we all went through this
whole free day thing about this way to

263
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,720
teach people how to use medical and also
hoping to get twenty people getting a

264
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,940
hundred and fifty just the thing we had
nowhere to go to go to a bigger venue

265
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,510
knows all the community and so after
this this whole thing happened Voss

266
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:00,080
eatery in myself and i kind if you my
friend we're all sitting down at a

267
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,409
pizzeria like a we should start a
conference here in Kentucky be awesome

268
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,540
and fun and so that's kind of how the
idea to become was born remember we're

269
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,190
going through the finances I I take a
lot of risks in my life it likely have

270
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,540
worked out just been some that have it
but like I literally would have been

271
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,450
completely financially crippled

272
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,710
be kind of workout like and and and so I
basically took out a second mortgage on

273
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,220
my house at the time cuz you know was
still pretty pretty young my career and

274
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,820
I cannot make any money off their condo
all the money that goes into began goes

275
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,730
in the next year but if no one showed up
they basically I would've been really

276
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:38,169
hurting for your financials at that
point I'm and so the first year we need

277
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:41,440
a three hundred people to break even and
so i i pulled out all the stops I call

278
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,539
my friends up like this and how can you
guys come to this conference and really

279
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,260
make it a big things we want to create
more family centric type of conference

280
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:52,809
and so we started their become and we
got eleven hundred people the first year

281
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:58,450
and so we obviously did a very good job
when it came to that and so it was

282
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,200
really awesome to kind of see in this is
actually the first year a little bit

283
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,679
bigger Dave than than what I was a
little bit actually I have much more

284
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:13,169
here and there but anyways now as a
first-year Derby Conn and since then you

285
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:17,380
know it's kind of neat Tennessee where
everything has gone into the people he

286
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,649
changed course trees in the background
but you know it's it's been interesting

287
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:26,049
to see how that's kind of grown in kind
of come through in two different things

288
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:30,769
that you're able to do with that now one
thing I'll say is that the media stuff

289
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:35,679
has been interesting and I am gonna show
a little video here about one that was

290
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,929
on CNN recently but you know when you go
in front of people like they're becoming

291
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:44,500
or you go when you talk in front of
presentations are you talking to a board

292
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,080
of directors are still people you have
to remember that you're talking to

293
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,059
people that may not understand what
you're doing and so the biggest thing

294
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,059
for me that I've learned is that
communication so I'm gonna show you this

295
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:59,980
is CNN and it's a good bit segment
because it'll it'll show a little bit

296
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,669
and start talking about about social
engineering in a second but a little bit

297
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:09,700
about the word hacker some creepy dude
the basement

298
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,399
like a misconception what if I told you
there's a class of hacker who don't just

299
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:14,989
happen

300
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,210
get more social intelligence than anyone
will ever meet I disagree with that but

301
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:25,540
i dont have a deadline and I DEF don't
have more so than everyone else out

302
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:25,879
there

303
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,780
David Kennedy is one of these what's
known as a social engineer or a people

304
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,040
hacker his practice to do people into
doing things and sharing information you

305
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:44,178
probably should it's funny it's funny
about that story ok so we're doing this

306
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:48,720
this interview for CNN and glory as
they're in and she was like hey can you

307
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,679
do try to hack my producer at least
he'll go I'm sure no problem so I you

308
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,190
know the producer is actually traveling
to France at the time and the reason I

309
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,860
was able to see that is he's got a
Twitter account so looking at taking

310
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,300
pictures in france also stuff and so I
took my phone number up and I speak my

311
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,669
number and I look like I'm coming from
Chase card services like all I said was

312
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:21,309
call Bob right here so you know what I
was like ok bob i just want to see this

313
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:26,190
is James from from credit card service
car chase Crawford services we've

314
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,140
noticed that there's been some weird
charges happening you know over and

315
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,970
you're currently in France right now and
you can hear kind of a sigh of relief as

316
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,650
you know establish credibility of
knowing where he's at a look at stuff is

317
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,590
a qAME France everything's fine I'm
buying some things here and stuff like

318
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,570
that no no problem ok great so if you're
in France I just want to go through a

319
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,379
couple of charges here just to make sure
that everything you have a legitimate ok

320
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,670
that's fine thank you thank you start
making some really horrible stuff like

321
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,929
bondage stuff right you know like German
bonded you know whatever you know and

322
00:27:55,929 --> 00:28:00,860
and also other things like you spent
$170 here no dissent the club which is

323
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,750
known for this and other by it and so
what I was doing there is embarrassing

324
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,760
and and putting them into an
uncomfortable situation which social

325
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,000
engineering terms there's a few
different ways you can do it there's

326
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,190
negative persuasion but uncomfortable in
this order not liking the situation

327
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,100
human beings will try to do whatever
they can to quickly rectify that

328
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,678
situation to deal with it anymore so I
was embarrassing him and obviously was

329
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,080
in a public place is probably there was
people so you don't want to repeat the

330
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,230
name of the place you know

331
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,290
that you say is fraudulent so I can get
it verify you know it's a horrible name

332
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:35,270
right and it doesn't look all that and
so are you not talking ok well I seem to

333
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,210
verify couple things I first got your
date of birth date of birth is super

334
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,679
easy and i thought id let me find out
about your date of birth on can you give

335
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,340
me your number they get your full credit
card number for the county secondary

336
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,330
vibe about right now is able to get
personal piece of information very

337
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,220
quickly

338
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,030
not knowing anything else happening so
you can get your credit card number that

339
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:03,530
was that illegal activity and David game
companies plan to find out if employees

340
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,418
are leading the company vulnerable his
team shows how it's done

341
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:11,720
step one of his number so it looks like
he's calling from inside the company and

342
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,220
then call tech support

343
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,440
hello you there

344
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,750
hello I was wondering if you cannot take
a look at a website trying to get to you

345
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:27,580
its for a job because it could be a good
thing I'm I'm so it's it's it's it's WWW

346
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:38,918
dot survey that's asked you are you why
dash pro dot com open and I'm at the

347
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,500
site now here's what the eighty guy
doesn't realize by clicking that link

348
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,009
he's just given David full access to his
computer that's weird I just sitting

349
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:48,730
there watching this is a good working
fine now

350
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,559
awesome I don't know what you did and i
really appreciate the help and that was

351
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,080
it

352
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,710
around a computer now you were able to
take take over this this guy's computer

353
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,980
with it I would say like under two
minutes under two minutes took over the

354
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,230
entire computer and think of it as not
just as computer but in this case the

355
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,190
company was paying David about this one
is you know the the biggest question I

356
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:19,529
get asked is why did you read it right
and and the truth of the matter is that

357
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:24,120
set was just arrived from starting off
very small the first generation of set

358
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,059
was something that was like a mailer
would send them mails out with like an

359
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,928
attention thing that had a PDF attached
to it right that would compromise the

360
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,850
computer and then you start adding a
little more right I added the Java

361
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,949
applets Hackford quickly after that an
added a few other things and it just

362
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,629
started to gradually take hold and that
wasn't popular first it wasn't at all

363
00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:43,860
knew about that as I added more features
and kept you know having fun with it

364
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,320
came out now you know one of the things
that people say it why do you get into

365
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,049
social engineering that something you do
and that's just practice just human you

366
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:55,649
know human nature and just talking to
people and actually understanding how

367
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:58,830
they relate and how you would react to
certain situations a lot of times before

368
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,730
I do a social engineering campaign I
actually like pretend and my wife to get

369
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,009
some perspective to say hey would you
believe this review you know this as a

370
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:09,870
person and so I get some good
perspective from the outside of our

371
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,469
different folks before actually going to
do something in this case you know if

372
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,309
you're not when I was calling the help
that's great I knew that there are

373
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:21,460
certain things that the help desk which
challenged me on my ass like hey can you

374
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,179
reset my password are going to challenge
me I need to know certain things

375
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,890
information you didn't know they can be
my last from a soldier in employee I D

376
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,910
or something that's gonna I'm not gonna
probably have the best I can do things

377
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,700
like probing that the final with those
are ahead of time and hopefully getting

378
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,530
that information through open source
intelligence or not but in this case I

379
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,990
was asking something that was that was
so trivial that require any type of

380
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,690
occasion and so you know as being
somebody that that focuses people are

381
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,450
talking to people you have to realize
that we're going into these types of

382
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,070
situations when you're going in and
you're doing a physical contest you're

383
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,580
doing and that you know in a date I'm
going to my place just don't need to

384
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,710
look suspicious you can promote walking
any building you want to do whatever you

385
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:07,130
want to if you're walking in earlier
like what are you what do you do when

386
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,370
you doing here right now is your idea
right you walk in your part of the

387
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,040
process you're on the phone especially
at what I do a lot of times all dressed

388
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,300
up in a suit or whatever so I look like
I'm an executive and I'll be on my cell

389
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,240
phone I look like an important in like
walking through and talking and so

390
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,540
people won't bother you walking through
just human nature I mean do you want to

391
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,320
interrupt summits on the phone and say
sir especially if you say you know

392
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,000
someone in authority based on our
culture they certainly are you supposed

393
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,540
to be here they don't typically do that
to the senate situation to create all

394
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,280
based on human behavior and everything
else that's been fun to learn in in in

395
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,000
Derby Conn was part of that now coming
from a chief security officer and i was

396
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,390
i was doing very well in that position
right I had a great team had a lot of

397
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:53,530
success to program is doing really well
as the youngest vice president in

398
00:32:53,530 --> 00:33:00,120
history and I'm going home one day to my
wife and I had just read you twins at

399
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,899
this time and so I had the time is
probably what to maybe and then head

400
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,680
brand new baby twins okay i three kids
and I got my wife you know after having

401
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,230
a great job and a wonderful and I have
job security on the worried about my job

402
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,410
or anything else having a perfect my
life right I go to Aaron and I sit down

403
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,340
at the table like hey I want to leave
people and I want to start my own

404
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,139
company she looks i mean in in you know
it's like one of those like perplexed

405
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,330
you're crazy what's going on and is he
serious writers April rate and you know

406
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:37,080
what was interesting about that is you
know we started talking about it it's

407
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,679
it's what I knew I wanted to do I wanted
to start my own

408
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,470
I wanted to you you know figure out what
that meant that you can just kind of my

409
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,190
next journey in life and I've always
been on the type of person that that

410
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:53,410
trust my gut and I know that sounds like
a horrible way of making decisions but

411
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,950
if you know it's the right thing for you
to do then why are you holding yourself

412
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,900
back and not doing it and so for me I
was like you know I'm happy here it's

413
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,000
great I don't know what this means to go
and run my own business but a min ago

414
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,159
and doing it up and be successful in
finding a new job later on and so I

415
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,810
literally laughed perfectly great job
and made the jump start my own company

416
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:17,100
and so the first company was just attack
and it was funny because when I started

417
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,360
trusts act like we're at a company so we
don't need a building rape and i dont

418
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,930
have you ever tried to work out of the
house where there's three kids it

419
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:29,730
doesn't after a week I was like ok it's
on there are killing each other up

420
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:37,880
stairs and they're screaming and also
has to offer and I am on a comp trying

421
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,560
to drum up some work or whatnot and so I
started trusted with the mindset of of

422
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,739
not having an office in quickly I'm like
ok need to have an office right now and

423
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:51,149
so this is the building that we first
started started and I was employee

424
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,610
number one and that was it

425
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,310
and this is my office this was trust
that this is the building and we always

426
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,799
literally in a building and we don't
have a lot of money so early ok well

427
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,140
just started you know in get the
cheapest place possible and literally

428
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,680
yeah like walking to the back of his
dungeon building there's no windows on

429
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,390
this place at all it's a basic in the
background checks like the furnace

430
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,069
heater and this is where we started our
our company are expressed are my company

431
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,730
and so owning are starting a business is
interesting because now your sales for

432
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,750
delivery

433
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,740
everything you possibly have to imagine
you need to be you need to understand

434
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,580
like tax codes and you know starting up
a low season all this other stuff that

435
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,319
had no idea how to do and I had no clue
and so figure all that out of this was a

436
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,430
process and kind of working through that
what I found is that you know if you

437
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,649
continue to try to do the right thing
good things happen and so it's just a

438
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,950
sack you know I started trying to drum
up working I had a lot of friends at

439
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,450
surpassing me some work and things like
that I was able to start to build up a

440
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:50,960
little bit and then I hired me that
decision to hire employee number two

441
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,970
point in reducing go so

442
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:57,810
well alright but I learned from that
experience right and since then it's

443
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,960
been going for nominated for three in
employee number for an employee number

444
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,540
five in 2006 and an hour up to
twenty-seven people I trust that second

445
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:09,849
that's in within four years and so you
know just a second great learning

446
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:12,260
experience because I've never done
anything like this before I've never

447
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:18,200
start anything but the thing with trusts
always surround myself with friends like

448
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,799
my head of sales

449
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,270
the reason why he's my head of sales
because my wife and his wife or walking

450
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,930
dogs now live in apartment complex when
I got the military and we're becoming

451
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:33,089
friends right you know larry i worked
with his wife at Diebold became good

452
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,710
friends of Larry came aboard you know
everybody that is part of trust asset

453
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:41,740
has been somebody that I've known for a
long time been on here but I didn't work

454
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,419
with that we've been friends ever since
then so I mean you know it's one of

455
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,970
those things where know culturally I try
to surround myself with just friends and

456
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,709
people that I know I know can do a good
job and that's kind of how I've always

457
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,560
modeled complete opposite of what they
tell your business name business never

458
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,619
hire friends on the exact opposite I
only her friends right you know and

459
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:04,130
Italian business hey you can't you know
do certain things one exact opposite way

460
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,859
you know we know I was gonna ask your
hey we have a custom dress up know our

461
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,930
culture jeans and t-shirts or whatever
you want to wear I mean that whatever

462
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:18,990
you want but you got to specify that guy
sometimes but you know it's it's a

463
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,029
culture where you can have fun you can
have guns are things you can do you know

464
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,890
if you decide you want to come in and
not work as long as you get your work

465
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,098
done that's fine you know come in and we
have couches that you can do whatever

466
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:31,900
you want to it's it's that type of
culture and so while I started trust the

467
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,540
sack a lot of things were happening in
life things are moving around and I

468
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:41,009
remember being in New York and the
health critic of stuff got there early

469
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,950
and so then I had to go and testify
before Congress and that was interesting

470
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:52,629
because Congress was something I never
experienced before and I thought I guess

471
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:55,170
I don't know what I thought right I
guess I went to congress it was kind of

472
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,619
expecting certain things that to be like
hey you know regardless of party lines

473
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:03,000
you know people would want to make
things better in my goal for going in

474
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,410
touch when congress wasn't the point out
that health care

475
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,410
horrible on that was a policy issue or
anything like that I mean I don't follow

476
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:14,299
politics I hate both parties I don't
like any of them right so you know when

477
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:17,390
I went there like listen I am concerned
about the security of health care like I

478
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:21,058
don't think it's it's it's secure and I
think that's the same for the entire

479
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:27,630
federal space and the state and local as
well and so instead I would I was met

480
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,950
with was a bunch of people yelling at me
and screaming at me and trying to get me

481
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,740
through a congress and saying it was a
bad hacker and in the second time that

482
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,399
testified to Congress was really
interesting because there is a

483
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,609
individual going to name a lot of time
ahead like Baltimore you never say never

484
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:48,980
again but you know he he started
registering fake Twitter accounts and

485
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,839
they trying to contact media saying that
I hacking health care governor should be

486
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,220
thrown in prison and also their stuff
right and so I started dealing with that

487
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,980
and if you look at the CFAA the computer
front of you set it so vague that it

488
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,859
really wanted to go out and referred for
googling some stuff and they probably

489
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:06,220
could and so at that point I'm like ok I
tried helping out I wasn't trying to do

490
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,089
anything malicious I wasn't hacking the
Site in any way shape or form you know I

491
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:13,640
was basically you know kind of thrown
out trying to try to throw out of

492
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,220
congress I decided never to do congress
ever gonna try to help them in any way

493
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:26,538
shape or form because then I went to
Katie Couric show up for a shot by the

494
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:34,529
way that you don't know the story behind
that I should hear what before but I was

495
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:38,970
on the show and there's a guy named
Benedict Cumberbatch who is the lead

496
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,669
actor in Sherlock as well as he's been
in like Star Trek Spock in Star Trek and

497
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:54,079
what time is right thank you and so he
was coming up afterwards and the Katie

498
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,079
Couric show and so they had her for
their head up next one of the world's

499
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,000
sexiest man alive but they remove the up
next like half a second okay and so of

500
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,480
course all my hacker buddies like a look
at this you know they voted you know and

501
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:15,220
it's perfect is that look is just
priceless I like 1030 good stuff so you

502
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,609
know this was interesting because Katie
Couric show was one of those ones where

503
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,350
I really felt that resonate people this
is ever here seen that before is it not

504
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,900
seen this Katie Couric interview I'm not
gonna go through the whole thing and I

505
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,850
literally have somebody live online TV
which is really needs and it kinda

506
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:35,430
resonated because it showed you know
what you're doing is kind of a thing

507
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:42,859
within that it was interesting we trust
that sack to go back to when I start to

508
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,290
trust that I had had a plan which is
really weird because I don't usually

509
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,360
plan things out but I wanted to start a
a defensive company too because I

510
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,600
figured hey I'm good at hacking maybe I
can help on the defensive side as well

511
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,380
and so I knew that building something
like an MSP or 24 7 stock like that

512
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,280
required a lot of investment a lot of
money and I didn't want to go the the

513
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,920
venture capital out and that's one thing
that I will say that this industry is

514
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,930
really messed up in a lot of ways ok
there's a lot of things happening out

515
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,850
there where there's money being thrown
out I think there's something like they

516
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:18,740
got was at 376 startups a month and
security around venture capitalists put

517
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,009
money to see what sticks and so you have
a lot of these companies now that that

518
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:25,200
that the rather you go to the Silicon
Valley Road which is like a few I have

519
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,799
an idea and in order for me to make this
i dnt to go get funding and if people

520
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,110
give you money for your idea and you can
hire developers and you can go make up

521
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:37,590
the stuff and then you get what's called
series ABC whatever findings and to get

522
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,120
different piece of money coming in said
hopefully you can become a proper

523
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,480
company what you do is you lose control
over the company the first time you do

524
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,580
that you what your idea is is no longer
relevant to what you're trying to do is

525
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,310
no longer relevant what you're trying to
accomplish is no longer relevant your

526
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:56,049
now at that even if it's a minority
ownership in that you now have Board of

527
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,970
Directors a deal with and also our stuff
and so I did the exact opposite I didn't

528
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,740
want any money from anybody I want to
start off from the bare bones from the

529
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,779
ground ground up and hey if I feel
that's great then I know hopefully find

530
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:12,110
a job somewhere else and so I wasn't
going to create another company EDS and

531
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:17,730
so about three years into I started by
now defense systems and started that

532
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,100
from the mindset of trying to develop
things and make things better and try to

533
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,670
be more defensive with different things
that are happening out there and so it

534
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,280
was one of the things that I've been
really happy with them in our work we

535
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,840
have a whole development team we have I
think

536
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,930
BDS is larger than just its acknowledges
it's crazy it's only been up for two

537
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,549
years and so you know it's one of those
things where you can make a difference

538
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:44,670
you can build about you can do it
yourself I mean nothing for me and I

539
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,890
know what the come to continue to move
forward with media suggesting I'm not

540
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,560
starting another company ever again I'm
done with that I don't have enough hair

541
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,400
left literally to go through what it
means that a company like you said a

542
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,280
company doing everything for your the a
charge for everything that happened near

543
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,940
the PRU the marketing you are everything
and so you know you work a ton of of

544
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,810
hours and you try to make things right

545
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,320
you know for your employees to make sure
that they're happy and that they like

546
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,070
what they do and also their stuff and so
what's to come

547
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:17,120
probably just continue to move it to
second BDS in working on some cool stuff

548
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,549
with that I have a really big thing that
we're working on the past two years and

549
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:23,760
hopefully coming on the next month when
the agency is a definite come down

550
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,940
without the family you know this was two
weeks ago as my first vacation that ever

551
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:35,390
taken since earning just so you know
much needed vacation so I came back

552
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:40,490
feeling very good but I don't think they
did it without my family what you can do

553
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:46,450
personally is that you know for it was
about finding what I wanted to do what I

554
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:51,759
like to do and that's the biggest thing
for me like when I go into work I don't

555
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,090
wanna hate work we spend so much time I
represent 60% of our lives are sitting

556
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:01,900
there at work doing something let me go
home to unwind right I think I think it

557
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,580
should be exact I mean that exact
opposite I think they should be very

558
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,120
complementary to each other when you go
to work you should enjoy going to work

559
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,609
you should have fun going to work so
make your work what you want to be

560
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:14,960
that's the biggest thing and in the way
you do that you find what you want to do

561
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,170
in this industry and you home in on a
new research the heck out of you get to

562
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:22,470
be good at that time good I mean I
there's way more smarter people

563
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:27,470
especially in this room and I am but I I
found something I like to do and I just

564
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,750
home tonight I remember when I was doing
my research I started getting to exploit

565
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,210
stuff right and doing a basic buffer
overflows and I read that there is this

566
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:39,090
this new concept and I think at the time
with him call dropped gadgets but there

567
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,780
is Robert on the programming and
understand how it works and no idea how

568
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,130
where and I had no idea what I was
getting

569
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:49,470
remember sitting there for three weeks
just trying to figure things out on the

570
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:53,359
couch frustrated upset and mad because I
can't figure out how this exploit works

571
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:58,799
and one day at work and persistence and
that they're feeling that you get after

572
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:03,410
you done something hard people in this
industry are smarter than one another or

573
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,990
just good at what we do because we have
enough persistence to get over that and

574
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:10,490
so if you want to learn exploit you can
do it absolutely does mean that you need

575
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,390
to be a brilliant mathematician anything
else that's all you can do is just be

576
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:16,019
giving enough persistence that we're
learning it doesn't mean that that

577
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:20,089
person has done before use any smarter
or better anything else just means that

578
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:23,990
you enjoy what you do you have fun with
it so for me going into work it's gotta

579
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:27,930
be fun when I go into work it's like hey
you know how things going in in having a

580
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,118
good time and I leave work excited and I
leave work when I want to you at two

581
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,349
o'clock or 3 o'clock at six o'clock
o'clock it doesn't matter you have to

582
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:38,980
you have to make what you want to be
successful and you have to make what you

583
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,509
want to be happy

584
00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:48,480
some CCDC to that part of it but some
CDC to give you folks on anybody here

585
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,220
actually the blue team yeah this one
group policy I'm gonna give you this one

586
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:01,919
put that in place the first thing you do
I remove the entire ministers from being

587
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,160
able to do this to make her life hell

588
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:11,930
got that taken pictures that one group
policy right here on make our lives hell

589
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:22,029
you really wanna mess with us throw some
threesome scheduled task and spray

590
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:31,279
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
these are on the place now one thing

591
00:46:31,279 --> 00:46:36,589
that you folks typically don't do we
should but as is put right because the

592
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:39,640
universe is very heavy one of the best
things you can throw on there which is a

593
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,819
twenty minute filers and put into the
Mac security mode download it's Matt

594
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:47,529
Microsoft based on those you recommend
any putting max mode make sure det som

595
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:51,759
thing else is our and then make it a
little harder for us to get things like

596
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:56,759
MS 38671 import it put all your bosses
don't just do you like the ones like

597
00:46:56,759 --> 00:46:58,380
right click and put on every process

598
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,670
on things and I guess positive you think
there's just too great books I recommend

599
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:07,100
the first one called originals on this
is a relatively new book and it's

600
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,540
basically a study of folks that have
been successful in business or have

601
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,800
changed the world for the better

602
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,110
okay and and the interview these folks
like Steve Jobs and other people in

603
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:23,600
different areas you look at what it took
for them to change the culture change

604
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,640
you know what was considered normal in
go a different route and what I was

605
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,259
interesting is that there are certain
people that were very good and

606
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,810
successful they had so many catastrophic
failures like Steve Jobs is a great

607
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,690
example of a lot of catastrophic
failures special even as he was super

608
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:42,300
success on Apple you get a certain type
of my guess is that you're very good

609
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,800
business person right but steve Jobs was
very good technology wasn't very good at

610
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,280
everything else and so he there is a
person I was trying to get some advice

611
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,060
from Steve Jobs about a new medical
breakthrough that was coming on this one

612
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,259
is medical breakthrough Steve Jobs
revolutionize the medical field is going

613
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,660
to be the biggest company in the world
within five years and all these other

614
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,230
things right and Steve Jobs in giving
like hundred million dollars for 10% the

615
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:10,160
company was just a concept and what's
interesting is that last year this this

616
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,700
medical company was the biggest tech
flop in our century right in and out in

617
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,560
heaven change it didn't work

618
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:23,170
only does steve Jobs was very right on
that one and the reason is because he

619
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,120
thought he was gonna business you
understood other areas of expertise and

620
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,240
he did understand the medical field
goals are different things you have to

621
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,060
focus on to you is that he might be very
good at certain things

622
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:35,790
focus on what you're good at and can
home in on there is a great book of kind

623
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,980
of the success and just taking a
positive influence one of the ones in

624
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,500
here as well as Elon Musk from
testifying SpaceX anything else

625
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,890
one of the things that was interesting
with him is that he wakes up every

626
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:51,549
morning with a positive outlook positive
outlook on life right if things are

627
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,390
going to find things to be great if he
saw one of his rocket ships that he

628
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:01,180
built you know trying to get reusable
rockets and so it shot up in a distinct

629
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:06,509
everything in a strange land itself on a
platform and it was going to land and is

630
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,080
landing and then landed itself which is
a huge accomplishment but then it fell

631
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,250
over then exploded

632
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,750
everything right obviously a hundred
million dollars hundred million dollars

633
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:21,540
lost and also what he wants a hit it
stayed up longer than the last one right

634
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,540
so having a positive outlook on things
is also something that's super important

635
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,590
to me and one of the things that you can
see kind of time again is that people

636
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,390
that are negative if you surround
yourself with people who in turn will

637
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,000
also become negative so if you're in an
environment that's hostile at the

638
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,600
negative you will be a negative person
as well and it's not good for your

639
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:43,850
health wise to go into that when you
wake up be positively happy another good

640
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,990
statistic is that what they did is they
did a study of people that wake up and

641
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,879
check your cell phone service in the
morning if you read an email that sets

642
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,370
you off in the morning like something
bad happened last year in your day for

643
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,650
rest all day so take your email and
don't read into you get into work other

644
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:04,840
things as well so he sent another one of
my favorite books there Chris Dickerson

645
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:09,070
actually recommended want to me go to
rework its a really good book because

646
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:13,130
it's basically the exact opposite of
what we're talking business it's like

647
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,100
hey you should only have meetings when
you absolutely need to have meetings in

648
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,360
this should only be like 10 min at
meetings with the people that you really

649
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,050
need to get the decisions done and they
should be standing meetings only because

650
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:25,140
people don't want to sit there and talk
the whole time right its exact opposite

651
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,330
of the hour long meeting you have to
have to rehash things in a meeting for a

652
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,970
meeting about it being specific about
another mean that you're gonna have so

653
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,330
you know reruns are really good book and
I painted the chapters were perfect for

654
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:39,660
me because these chapters like three
pages long and so it goes on top of the

655
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,899
ninth opportunity topic and works very
very good at me but its exact opposite

656
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,890
of what we should be thinking and how
should be doing things on in a good way

657
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:53,569
I really recommend this as a bug in here
every work for a couple great book last

658
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:56,570
but not least

659
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:02,730
positivity rate and if you saw there is
a there is a video of somebody just

660
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:06,320
going to ride in the trunk routes
temporarily and Bernie Sanders rally in

661
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:10,430
just giving out hugs and everybody
accepted the hugs and it was one of

662
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:12,910
those things that you know people were
laughing and smiling and having a good

663
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:17,940
time with changing culture isn't meant
to be about a hug hug that's fine but no

664
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,560
making people around you positive in
working with people and and and changing

665
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,210
people for the for the better is what
it's all about because at the end of the

666
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:27,550
day rolling on the surfer small period
time and so we can make those changes

667
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,640
have people and you can kind of hand
over the next generation to a certain

668
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,710
way that's a good thing he made a big
impact on the community itself so for me

669
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,680
it's always been about the positivity of
industry in Derby Conn is a good reason

670
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:49,509
for that as well so so I got any
questions anytime anytime hugs

671
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:52,510
anytime

672
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:04,870
interesting enough questions as well as
a lesson to learn from the second employ

673
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:09,950
so what what happened in in just to give
it a perspective trust has been in

674
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,529
business for five years

675
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:18,140
ok and in those five years we've had two
people one was for personal reasons and

676
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,690
and we're still had a great a great
opportunity that's one thing that I

677
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:25,420
never told my employees like listen you
want to go and let me know and I will

678
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,110
find you a better job like you know it's
just one of those things where they can

679
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,850
I try to help people in every way shape
or form so go ahead to people ever ever

680
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:36,799
leave the company when it comes to that
the one individual there it was it was a

681
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:44,240
personality and more so I don't get into
specifics of it but you know the person

682
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,609
was going through a lot of the time and
it wasn't something it wasn't good for

683
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:50,990
one of us in one thing that I did they
didn't hire friend it was something that

684
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:55,660
I really don't know and that was kind of
you know newer in industry type of thing

685
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:00,220
and that's fine that's great just you
know that the habit of not actually

686
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,240
doing work or seeing you do something
about doing things didn't work out

687
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,790
unfortunately that during that time
that's only person ever actually had a

688
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,400
prior history

689
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:16,600
be a good question I don't know why
people become a different path might we

690
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,900
don't like fire people like putting
encompasses where they can be successful

691
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,530
so you know if someone isn't working out
then I tried to move them to a different

692
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,580
place that they can be successful to
work and be happy because you know it's

693
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,799
not good for anybody if they're not
happy

694
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,970
question nothing else I will thank you
very much
