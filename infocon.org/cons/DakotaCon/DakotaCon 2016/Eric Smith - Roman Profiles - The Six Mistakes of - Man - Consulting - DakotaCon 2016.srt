1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,850
talking a lot about I always get asked a
question of how do I get into this

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,000
industry and what am i doing now and
where I want to go you know five years

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,240
so I've always been a consultant and
there's a lot of things I've learned

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,180
over time being a consultant and so I
wanted to to use this opportunity to

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,689
share some of those things with you guys
and and and have some interaction along

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,859
the way so that is the ideal on this
talk is to make it as interactive as

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,210
possible so at any point I'd like to
have someone else and I like that before

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,200
this we're talking about somebody's
principles so a little about me I'm not

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,770
going to bore you here but I've been
doing consulting now since 1998 and have

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,340
always been in the security industry
during penetration testing and a lot of

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,559
other services that the kind of fall
under the security umbrella if you will

12
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,530
last at say probably seven or eight
years I had more focus around London

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,949
threat assessments which is kind of a
combination of physical social

14
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:03,839
electronic dance prior to starting my
own company with a good friend my Chris

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,890
Dickerson work for other consultants
season and places like that so I've seen

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,450
a lot and and kind of brought me to
where I am with some of the things we

17
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,509
talked about today so agenda you can
read am I gonna go through those a

18
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:22,400
little bit of why dave says he's old I
think I actually have about five or six

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,470
years on David cared about young he is
so it's funny to hear Dave say it's all

20
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,970
because I think I'm older than he is but
because I'm old and because I've been in

21
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,450
this industry for a long time it tends
to make you a bit jaded the more you see

22
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,729
not only interacting with with the
clients and customers and and and

23
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:44,170
environments but also interacting with
with peers

24
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,460
you become a bit jaded because of things
you see in you want to change but can

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,829
easily change as fast as you want to one
of the other issues that that we've seen

26
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:58,479
for a long time and I'm sure David
assets which is why is not choices I Z

27
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,548
is is real consultants are few and far
between

28
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,710
there's there's a lot of people out that
take the title of consulting these days

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,389
and they don't really know the
definition behind what consulting means

30
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:14,420
so hopefully today we can cuddle some of
those as well and you guys can ask

31
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,760
questions along the way the other things
that that is awesome to see environment

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,329
like this is the opportunities that you
guys have today didn't exist for us as

33
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,819
Davis kinda hit a bit the conferences
and the the workshops and training

34
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:38,720
programs and the the open conversations
conversations you have with your peers

35
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,780
whether it's in person or over the
Internet

36
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,170
those this didn't happen so there's a
lot more information sharing a lot more

37
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,458
learning experiences that just did exist
when we were growing up so it's awesome

38
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,070
to see things like this where we can
actually share and talk about what we've

39
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,650
learned and where you guys are trying to
fit in and learn to the big ones

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,250
obviously of I'm trying to do this is
our industry as a whole needs a lot of

41
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,970
change it's it's it's still a young
industry in the sense of of the world

42
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,209
itself and I T

43
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,650
but there's there's a lot of there's a
lot of areas where improvements can be

44
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:21,579
made not only in quality but in in
people as well so the idea behind the

45
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:25,690
adaptation of the the six mistakes of
man which is what these

46
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,780
the talk is about israeli adapting that
to consulting there's there's a lot of

47
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,980
reasons why consulting in in general is
broken in one of those that that we've

48
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,850
always joke around within this industry
is the whole compliance or security

49
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,590
peace right there's going to be a
consultant I'm gonna help you become

50
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,880
compliant and you continue operating in
making money but does that really cool

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,720
security

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,500
and we'll touch on some of those things
later in the talk and other pieces

53
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,780
complacency that falls in this industry
a lot of times there's the you get

54
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,530
comfortable what you're doing and you're
afraid of change so there's the

55
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,570
repeatable process a lot of times that
that he will follow the same path and

56
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,100
not really do anything beyond what
they've done to day before so there's

57
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,820
really not a lot of of of change that
that we'd like to see and so any time

58
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,219
one of us is giving a talk like this or
are speaking about the industry in

59
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,280
general we try to make as much as we can
because that's the only way it's going

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,940
to get better right but a lot of people
are afraid of this changes so whenever

61
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,460
there's an opportunity where we can
identify improvements that's the whole

62
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,370
point of consulting in general right is
identify where flaws are either in and

63
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,810
practices are principles or technology
or or skill sets in and help evolve

64
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,630
those and grow those the standardization
has always been a big issue in our

65
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,630
industry there's there's the attempts to
standardize and then there's a lot of

66
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,560
lack of standardization one of the
things that I'm pretty proud of myself

67
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,150
and now probably for Silenor people got
together and started putting a a

68
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,599
standard for how and racial testing
should be conducted so about 45 years

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,810
ago now I think we put together what's
called the penetration testing standards

70
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,310
and start defining exactly what a pin
test should be from start to finish so

71
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,560
things like that are starting to become
more prevalent in this industry because

72
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,800
there's there's more people more players
and more services and consultancy shops

73
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,540
and everything else and because of that
the pool gets a bit muddied up so trying

74
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,330
to standardize things becomes more
prevalent now than it was five or 10

75
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,710
years ago but one of the reasons why
that needs to happen is because the

76
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,760
quality of services that we have today
is horrible

77
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,740
there's I don't even know how to put a
number on it it's it's tough to say how

78
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,460
many

79
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,580
good consultancy shops and good
consultants there are anymore because

80
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,240
there's so many people and players in
the game that is difficult to weed

81
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,400
through some of the sometimes expression
of your customer and try to pick out a

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,020
quality service or quality consultancy
in there was a big ones that we've

83
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,740
always seen as industry is the bait and
switch there's Univ sell as much as you

84
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,620
can on a LAN card on some marketing
material the certifications in the

85
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,150
skills everything else you have and then
once you get a signed contract put the

86
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,429
lowest paid engineer on it

87
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,270
make the biggest margin you can do a
little bait and switch and the customer

88
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,139
never really knows so there's there's a
lot of those problems in our industry in

89
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,190
the first place and so that the idea of
the stock is to try to find some of

90
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,639
those are talking some of those with you
gots some of these upcoming top dollar

91
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,490
touched all already marketing everyone
knows that the father we do with

92
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,789
marketing slogan is always been a big
problem in our industry the funding with

93
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,568
a scope should be but I think the big
one here that that I like to touch on we

94
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,759
start talking about some of the other
point I want to make later is the the

95
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,849
start hacking that happens in our
industry there's a there's a lot of of

96
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:58,400
selfish reasons for why people do what
they do in our industry and and referred

97
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,359
to as start hacking now which is more
just China game your own you know

98
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,430
selfish reputation and showing off on
someone else's network or someone else

99
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,979
has done and so that's become a big
problem industry as well and and there's

100
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:14,990
not there's not a lot of controller and
that anymore because there's a lot of

101
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,009
trust goes into allowing someone to
operate in your environment and there's

102
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,560
not a lot of control they have over
those people once they're on their

103
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,090
network and so at the end the day
there's a lot of selfishness comes out

104
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,758
of that so if we think about back in the
day

105
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,759
not when when David our kids

106
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,710
so back where there was a second half
and all day I'll be really loud really

107
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:54,590
glad to test back with twin sister was
around which is who we're getting too

108
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:02,400
there was what what we refer to as red
team testing and his idea or their idea

109
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,010
back in the day was going and conquer
burn it down and we can't really go into

110
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,800
conquering and burn it down now so there
are some limitations for all we're

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,740
allowed to do when we do interact with
someone's environment so who is this guy

112
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:22,520
studies as anybody recognize the name a
few on here so ancient philosopher he

113
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,330
was he was known for a lot of things one
of the big things that he was known for

114
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:34,829
is public speaking and his his
introduction to Greek philosophy for the

115
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:40,530
romance and so when when you think about
sister I was a person has a lot of

116
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,500
things that you can you can too close to
what a consultant is public speaking

117
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,050
presentations writings being the subject
matter expert if you will

118
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,750
you know various topics all the same
kind of fall under the umbrella of what

119
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:02,440
a consultant should be so if you adapt
to Cicero was to a consultant is present

120
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,080
day there's things that that aligns very
well right there's the consultant should

121
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,970
be these experts these pioneers in the
game and there's a lot of consultants

122
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,210
that that you guys are probably either
seen percent or watch their videos or or

123
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,890
use their tools and and I would
certainly consider those pioneers our

124
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,600
industry there are paving the way for
new services new value new tools allow

125
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,700
those qualities that that Cicero add you
can find it in some of the today's

126
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,750
consultants and experts in our industry
but there's also other qualities that

127
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:39,420
you can equate to those the the being a
positive and and and influential speaker

128
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,660
being able to stand up and stand in
front of people like today and and relay

129
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,410
some kind information to them and they
walk away with with more knowledge in

130
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,490
and some kind of vision into something
that maybe they never had exposure to so

131
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,769
a lot of those qualities as sister I was
able to do back then

132
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,519
still are are valuable qualities today
when you think about it consulted in our

133
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,829
industry one of the big things that that
i've i've insert about put a lot of

134
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:10,079
times I mouth but it does happen is
being able to speak your mind and not

135
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,109
let some of those inhibitions get in the
way when you're talking to clients

136
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:19,490
talked into two piers and and having
enough courage to state your opinions

137
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,230
instead of letting the the industry kind
of you know shape you and in control how

138
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,639
you think or where you want to go and
and worker what your direction maybe so

139
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:34,459
when you think about a consulted there
they should while they have very strong

140
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,779
opinions a lot of times many of them are
afraid to speak those because they're

141
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,089
worried about what their impression
might be or or their reputation might be

142
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,939
if they're wrong in their peers eyes and
that should be our consulted or anyone

143
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,560
should operate right you should be
worried about what someone's going to

144
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,219
think of you win when you stay a belief
in something and we feel strongly enough

145
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,279
about it you should at least attempt to
try and and educate someone else about

146
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,670
how you feel about being a prick about
it and so there's a there's there's the

147
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,569
right way to do things the wrong way to
do things are so when you think about

148
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:11,060
applying some of those principles to do
these you know powerful philosophers and

149
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,040
writers and speakers there's a right way
for them to present information there's

150
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,399
the wrong way and there's a lot of both
in our industry today and then the other

151
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,880
big piece i think is is the education
you guys are obviously you know doing

152
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,180
well there you're on the right track to
have a formal education and something

153
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,370
that you hopefully are passionate about
and then being able to take that

154
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,610
education that discipline and and use
that as as a jumping-off point for your

155
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:41,160
career so one of the last pieces that I
like his sister was very very good at

156
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,550
profiling mankind and that's a big
statement obviously for a philosopher

157
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,910
and if you if you try and put that into
sense of other consulted a lot of times

158
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,980
when we're talking to clients you have
to understand the mentality you have to

159
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,720
read people you have to know

160
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,139
what what they might be open to an end
where you might be able to open their

161
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:04,160
mind a bit more because they haven't
thought about these things so when you

162
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,370
look at Cicero vs today's consultant
there's a lot of areas where you have

163
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,959
the ability to to identify with people
and relate to people and and profiles

164
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,758
some of those things and then use those
affairs when you're doing attacks too so

165
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,269
that's a whole nother whole other talk
so let's talk about this issue 6

166
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:25,579
mistakes or six principles that that
Cicero came up with first one is that

167
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,550
illusion of personal gains made by
crushing others if any of you have work

168
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,189
in our industry or in the lot industries
that's that's a big one that exists a

169
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:37,870
lot today there's a lot of egos are a
lot of reputation and there's a lot of

170
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,579
belief that the only way you're going to
Excel is to is to step on others along

171
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,800
the way to make yourself look better the
second one is the tendency to worry

172
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,008
about things I cannot be changed or
corrected and that was huge there's a

173
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,910
there's any time you're working on on
products like dave was talking about

174
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,860
with you know writing tools and encoding
and things like that if if you're

175
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,079
getting bogged down in in the things
that need to be done or change your

176
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,800
corrected you lose sight of what you're
trying to go so those become remedial

177
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,449
and small task along the way even though
they might be bigger problems but as you

178
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:14,729
start shopping in in in Kuala sign and
in accomplishing these small things as

179
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,860
you go then you're getting close to the
finish line right there when is

180
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,800
insisting things are impossible because
we cannot accomplish it and and we'll

181
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,399
touch on details there but the the
takeaway there really is worried about

182
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,910
the things that you can't fix not things
that can be fixed and we'll go through

183
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,610
some of those a little more detail

184
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,720
fourth one is refusing to set aside your
preferences

185
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:39,439
that's a huge win because a lot of times
when when you're looking at

186
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,710
anything and you have kind of a
preconceived notion in your head will

187
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:48,770
blind you to so many other opportunities
or or you know some of the other

188
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,010
directions you might be able to go right
if it is neglecting development and

189
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,080
refinement of the man of the mind and
not acquiring the habit of reading and

190
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,040
studying you guys know this first hand
right you're not going to get to where

191
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,900
you want to go without bettering
ourselves through education through

192
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,939
reading through teaching through you
know conversing with peers all these

193
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,820
things make you a better person stronger
person and and frankly make you more

194
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,870
attainable when you're talking about
advancing your career right disciplines

195
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,010
and education is huge and the last is
attempting to compel us to believe and

196
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,700
live as we do and that's that's a big
one right if if your if your passion

197
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,779
about what you're doing and and you care
about instilling that passion to someone

198
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,250
else you're going to have that
motivation and drive to to try and get

199
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,490
people on board with what you're trying
to do right well that's selling things

200
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,500
whether that's creating your own tools
and and and you know your own techniques

201
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,970
or maybe that's trying to deliver a new
message or new insight to someone trying

202
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,920
to compel others to believe in what
you're doing is going to make them

203
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,290
better because they're going to
understand where you're coming from

204
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,709
because you're describing it was alright
so let's talk about the first delusion

205
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:01,189
of personal gains made by crushing
others so I had to talk a little bit of

206
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,620
this right there's in our industry one
of the big problems he faces is egos you

207
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,140
as you get better at what what we do for
example you know being a contested right

208
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,830
as you get better there's there's two
directions that usually takes people

209
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,820
when you look at them at a macro level
and that's they they get confident and

210
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,240
they want to go learn more and become
better and then there's the you know I'm

211
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,120
on the gift this industry and their
heads blow up and become very

212
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,500
egotistical and that becomes a roadblock
not only for them but also for the

213
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,610
clients and customers are working for
the ego so big one that we have to watch

214
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,260
out for in our industry and because of
that it's like I said before it becomes

215
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,779
very easy for you to make yourself look
better by making someone else look less

216
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:50,910
than you right you guys know that just
from you know dealing with people in the

217
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,230
world is our industry it's it's across
the board right there's there's more to

218
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,089
gain when you teach someone in the crush
them obviously so you know keep things

219
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:04,910
in mind as as you guys are learning and
whether you're doing Blue Team Red Team

220
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,949
White team or you know you want to go in
and you know build which it's as you as

221
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,040
you become better at what you do there's
there's a level of of humbleness that

222
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,800
you have to maintain so that you you can
maintain respect of your peers but also

223
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,969
doesn't cloud your judgment right you
know that you have areas where you still

224
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,200
need to improve and that's something
that that we face especially in my

225
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,600
industry or our industry is there's
there's always areas for us to learn

226
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,320
more and taking the mentality that that
we know what all is just going to leave

227
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,940
you with less friends and no idea where
you need to go and focus in eventually

228
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,500
you're gonna get left behind one of the
big things that we see is there's a lot

229
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,970
of competition between consultancies and
because of that there's there's a lot of

230
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,480
there's a lot of bad press that happens
a lot of times there's a lot of firing

231
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,680
back and forth because competitiveness
doesn't always bring positive

232
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,859
environments and Dave knows us well
dealing with with your bidding on jobs

233
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,928
I'm sure john does to you know there's
there's a lot of there's a lot of bad

234
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:14,900
bad told that that occurs between gets a
lot of times when in the end we're all

235
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,459
kind of out for the same thing is not
making money it's helping our customers

236
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,920
and so when

237
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,770
when we're doing things like that it's
it's difficult sometimes to to to

238
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,540
navigate your way through some of that
and and keep keep focus on where you try

239
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:36,360
to go alone we always joke around about
is the the dot hack Angry its same

240
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,100
principle applies there right if if you
know during red team tomorrow if we're

241
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,800
beating our heads on a break into one
your systems and we can't get in and we

242
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,070
become angry we become a dick clouded on
what we're trying to do so

243
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,040
same thing applies here right if if
you're becoming angry at your peers are

244
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,190
at the industry you're going to lose
focus on where you need to go right and

245
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,350
then the big one that that I i try to
believe every day and and I think you

246
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,449
know David John everyone else and
operates you know in our our small box

247
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,340
because it a small industry is there are
no experts anymore there's areas were

248
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,429
all of us are strong there's area but
areas where all of us need to improve

249
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:21,150
and being a jack of all trades as much
more valuable these days than being a

250
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,800
subject matter expert one or two pieces
so don't feel like you need to become an

251
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,290
expert at one particular piece of of
your industry

252
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,070
broad knowledge these days as much more
positive especially when I'm looking to

253
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,179
hire somebody broad knowledge is much
more beneficial invaluable to us as a

254
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,110
shot vs as an expert in contesting her
physical security or or coding or

255
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,949
whatever it might be

256
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:58,620
questions here me awake and i got a
system like teacher systems like

257
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,550
bringing things so second one worry
about things that can't be changed to

258
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,139
correct it

259
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,870
this is always a big one the the thing
to keep in mind whether you're talking

260
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:28,810
about your next 25 points on the test so
when you're when you're talking about

261
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:34,310
what what needs to be done right you're
looking at at at building at all you're

262
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,300
writing a program you're gonna break
into an apartment

263
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,990
there's always going to be things that
have to change have to happen to be

264
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:46,090
fixed and an important piece there is
worried about the ones you can't fix and

265
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,709
in most cases if you if you look hard
enough and you gotta step back and look

266
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,540
at the big picture those things can be
changed as well so don't get bogged down

267
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,810
with things you can't fix or about the
ones that you can start fixing those

268
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,050
things all of a sudden you realize that
hey I'm taking it ready to go right

269
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:07,139
there's there's always the important
decisions that you make and as you as

270
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,080
you focus on those you realize that the
the important ones will solve some of

271
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,850
your your secondary and kind of
dependency issues whether it's breaking

272
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,490
into an environment or building a tool
or you know coming up with a new topic

273
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,880
for what you gonna talk on right there's
there's the areas that you should be

274
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,490
concerned about their important then
there's these lesser severe issues that

275
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,880
led come you know not important enough
significant at all so 31 insisting that

276
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,770
I think is impossible because we can
accomplish that picture so it's

277
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,960
impossible for one approach right you
look at things and you go but that's not

278
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,100
gonna work so always have a list kind of
a backup plan if I'm not gonna be a

279
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,189
break in this way is going to other
areas I can focus on the trial gain

280
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,690
access maybe I can't fix the software
bug today but there's other areas that

281
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,260
that I can focus on and there's another
approach I can take that those will

282
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,100
become more prevalent and more important
later right but you're always going to

283
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,969
have these stains that are going to be
in your way whether its budget

284
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,130
constraints whether it's you know
solution dependencies you can't fix us

285
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,169
right now because it's going to break
something else and so

286
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,769
worrying about you know what this whole
thing is not going to work anymore

287
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:16,200
because we have these other issues that
are going to have to pop up and and get

288
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,999
salt first you gotta have that every day
especially when you get into enterprise

289
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:23,710
environments you know looking at things
from my perspective for example we go

290
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,320
and we assess an environment and there's
a list of items that we might provide to

291
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,549
a client to fix their some of the things
that they're going to just have to

292
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:34,989
accept the business accept the risk
maybe they have insurance to cut off

293
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:37,639
some of those things but they're
probably not gonna get six for a long

294
00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:41,459
period of time so if you're responsible
for those stains and and those are

295
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,720
becoming an issue for you that's kinda
clouding your judgement then it's going

296
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,230
to hinder all the other things are
working on so as a business owner as AC

297
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,440
so for a company as a director of
security in your managing environment

298
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,710
whatever it might be

299
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,119
there's always going to be areas that
you can't necessarily fix right away

300
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,649
saying that applies to more for the
competition you know there's going to be

301
00:22:03,649 --> 00:22:07,100
things he might go to fix first there's
other injects coming in there's other

302
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,549
responsibilities you might have and so
focused on what you can do right now is

303
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:13,918
going to give you a much better leg up
when you get to the point of those

304
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,179
things except for a period of time right
and those things apply to you know what

305
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,519
you guys have been doing in school as
well there's there's areas that you can

306
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,100
accomplish right now understands that
kind of have to wait put on the

307
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:30,730
backburner a bit fourth when refusing to
settle this one's a big one right

308
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,639
there's you know again the ego kind of
comes into this and a lot of areas

309
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:40,019
especially with what we deal with but
realizing that the problems that that

310
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:45,309
surface is it always about you and it is
always a personal threat to you there's

311
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:49,220
there's the I've been doing this for a
period of time I'm gonna become

312
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,820
complacent because it's kind of a habit
and then there's a need to fix these

313
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,249
things become more successful so there's
always a balance of a complacent its

314
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:01,809
forces being more successful in areas
that you can focus on without getting in

315
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:05,559
the way of yourself and so one of the
things that we always try and encourage

316
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:11,200
is not becoming a problem that hinders
yourself don't get in the way of your

317
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,850
self check yourself at the door

318
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,029
egos at the door leave you know the the
selfishness that you know it all or you

319
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,379
already have this figured out leaving
some of those things that the door and

320
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,820
keep an open mind as you start

321
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,470
going into some of these new
environments into a new job role into

322
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,389
you know a blue team environment
tomorrow having those stains behind you

323
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:33,189
when you walk in with a clear mind is
gonna give you a much better leg up on

324
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,190
the competition

325
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,909
neglecting development refinement of the
mind and not acquired the habit of

326
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:42,630
reading studying I don't think we need
to really go into that when you guys

327
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:50,330
find out pretty well being acknowledged
the the the the self-improvement pieces

328
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,178
huge right you know you're only going to
get better as you study

329
00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,080
veterans you learned from your peers and
you come to you know things like this

330
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,799
and and listen and learn better if you
have enough humbleness to go I don't

331
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,850
know enough about this I'm going to
learn from someone else so keeping those

332
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,799
things in mind as as you continue in
your education as well as going in and

333
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,320
getting a job in the industry

334
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,559
those things become more important to
you especially when when you take on a

335
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,960
new role or new position in a company
there's going to be areas where you

336
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,230
don't know everything and falling back
on the principles you're learning right

337
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,629
now and call it just gonna give you a
much better leg up as you start going in

338
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:30,799
and and realizing that are so much more
you have to learn you know you've

339
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,110
learned this much when you're inside
these walls and now you're in an

340
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,689
environment that's not necessarily what
you learn a text book is getting a lot

341
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,250
of personal development is going a lot
of research there's gonna be a lot of

342
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,809
reading a lot of frustrations realizing
that you don't know as much as you

343
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:49,490
thought you did and that's unfortunately
what we can to fix every day in the last

344
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,929
one is attempting to help others to
believe in love as we do so there's

345
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:56,840
there's different beliefs in this room
there's there's a lot of different

346
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,168
beliefs and our industry as a whole and
because of that there's a lot of

347
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:06,169
diversity however if if we if we harness
that diversity and we use it the right

348
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:06,879
way

349
00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:12,039
diversity creates new ideas right
diversity brings creativity and so

350
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,539
because everyone has different opinions
and because you can get together and

351
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:20,230
talk about those eventually something's
gonna come to the surface above all as

352
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,779
others so that's how those things be
created whether it's you know again a

353
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,169
new tool in their product and technology

354
00:25:26,169 --> 00:25:29,669
you know for us we know always launching
new services and those things are

355
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:32,820
spawned because when you sit down in a
room with your peers

356
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,469
there's a lot of different opinions and
different ideas and so as you start

357
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,640
hashing those things out something's
gonna come to the surface more than the

358
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,330
others and that's how how those things
become you know new services new

359
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,580
products new tech you think about things
that have come in overtime whether it's

360
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,500
you know flight for space travel or
cloning sheep or whatever might be all

361
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,549
this thing started with someone sit in a
room and someone else told him they were

362
00:25:55,549 --> 00:26:00,110
probably wrong so keep things in mind as
you have these ideas don't be afraid to

363
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,500
discuss them afraid to reach out to your
peers and and and kind of bounce ideas

364
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,799
off each other a lot of mortgage shot
down and then you'll find that you know

365
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,980
one of those he probably thought was a
very important someone else goes you

366
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,910
think you hit something there let's
let's focus on that more with you guys

367
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,510
recognize this guy or not but I this is
from an old slide and it actually fits

368
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,200
pretty well and the easy solution for a
lot of this is is just a note about

369
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:30,010
consulting right this that guy right
there is he's consulted in Atlanta and

370
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,620
he's probably one of the worst because
he he claims is the world's number one

371
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:40,309
hacker and so he for a while we were all
kind of beating up on him and he became

372
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,820
kind of the face of the industry if you
will for for the things not to do but in

373
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,678
reality you know let's talk about what
is and is not consulting so take a

374
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,950
customer for example they they have a
service they have a need and they hire

375
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,470
someone to come in and perform this task
right so contractor comes in a

376
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,150
consultant to do the job may be there an
engineer by title and when they're done

377
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,860
they will they get paid they walk away
but if you look at the service they

378
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,949
provided they did a service and had an
outcome that probably would have got

379
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,919
from anyone else they hired in that
industry whether it's replacing your AC

380
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,320
unit or a roof of your house chances are
if you call any of the numbers in the

381
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,770
phone book or whoever use the form of
these days but you know she call anyone

382
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,379
that's under that title of putting a
roof on your house going to come in

383
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,850
against all the roof gonna leave and
chances are you could get the same roof

384
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,320
same quality from to let people down the
block right but if you think about those

385
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,870
stains there was by definition there was
no consulting that occurred they came in

386
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,840
the customer needs something done they
perform the task and they left so by

387
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,370
definition that's not consulting thats
engineering that's maybe doing you know

388
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,059
some kind of contract work but there's
no interaction there's no dialogue

389
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:56,760
information sharing there's no you know
trying to educate that person to do

390
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,960
something more than what they're already
doing and chances are when they were

391
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,950
hired to the job the customer told him
what to do so it was already pre came in

392
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:09,740
and laid out for them to do already so
white and hired expert in that area

393
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,730
told them what to do and in reality the
way consultants are viewed in and how

394
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,220
they should be viewed as they are coming
into the environment with a a large

395
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,900
amount of knowledge in that area that's
why you called them you call them

396
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,929
because you don't necessarily have the
expertise in that area so you've called

397
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:29,170
the subject matter expert to come in and
have a conversation with you to figure

398
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,440
out exactly what you need and that's the
whole point of consulting if if you

399
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,250
already knew what you needed just hired
the you know the engineered on the block

400
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,830
do what you want to do when they walk
away but the art of consulting if you

401
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,370
will is being able to have those
interactions with customers and sit down

402
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,260
and go let's figure out where you really
want to go let's figure out what is

403
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,530
going to take to get you there and so
that that by design is what consulting

404
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,820
should be in if you're if you're in the
market to get some of the services done

405
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,879
in the future

406
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,520
things out have those conversations and
be able to play you know what the person

407
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,940
you're talking to a bit to figure out
how they offering new ideas are they do

408
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,900
they have the courage to say you know
what that is necessarily correct they

409
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,620
just care about getting your money order
the actual conversations going I

410
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,149
recommend doing it this way I don't
necessarily agree with everything you're

411
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:21,880
saying and or maybe I do but there's the
the open interaction that that you're

412
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,820
having with US customers to not only
educate them a bit where they might be

413
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,559
short but they also have you as an
expert because they called you in the

414
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,250
first place so be the expert give them
as much as you can about what they're

415
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:42,880
asking you to do so some of the pitfalls
that we see in our industry is is we're

416
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,610
consulting fall short and a lot of those
is because the right questions are asked

417
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,639
that open interaction right that dialect
of

418
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,700
well you know I called you for this
particular reason how are we going to

419
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,060
get to the finish line where I need to
go and so there's there's a lot of bad

420
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,560
habits that that come into play when
you're having his interactions and at

421
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,270
the end if if you had a had the right
service perform other eye consultants

422
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:12,250
shop then there's gonna be no value when
they're done they're gonna leave a stack

423
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,980
of papers on your desk gonna write a
check and nothing's gonna change in your

424
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,080
environment so as you're looking at
areas where permit can be made to

425
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,270
organization think about what the
outputs are going to be is it really

426
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,610
gonna change that businesses are going
to change the environment or are they

427
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,300
really just gonna sit back and you know
pushed the papers to the side and a year

428
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:36,510
from now have the same conversations
with someone else so quickly ok sorry if

429
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:41,300
if I'm a customer and I'm asking for a
pin dust Dave John you guys can answer

430
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:48,070
if I'm asking for a pin tell us what's
the first thing that should be asked for

431
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:55,590
schott had some mobility guess so why
why should be number one answer and

432
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:00,149
because of that it's if you don't know
why you're having a conversation in the

433
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,790
first place you don't know where to take
them did they say here that you know pin

434
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,240
testing was cool bar talking to somebody
they have a breach did you know they

435
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,720
they have some kind of compliance driver
behind it saying that they have to get

436
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,130
this done before the end of the year one
of the reasons why you're even on the

437
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,160
phone talking to them or you're sitting
on the table in and possibly trying to

438
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,720
get them to understand what you do
understand the why is gonna help you

439
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,820
have some direction of where you're
going with it and then at the same time

440
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,460
leave some of those those common issues
we talked about already at the door

441
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,970
right you don't necessarily have the
perfect solution as soon as she sat down

442
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,710
but having this conversation with them
together you can build develop what that

443
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,500
solution might be whether it's you know
testing services whether its technology

444
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,760
whether it's burning it all down the
starting over

445
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,070
there's a lot of different things shake
out when you start talking about the was

446
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:53,580
so let's talk about the version 2 of
consulting we're we're things need to to

447
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,939
go if we're going to make some of these
changes right and the big one for me

448
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,880
is passion if if you're not passion
about what you're doing then get out of

449
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,309
the game get out of the industry because
you're in the way of someone else has

450
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:09,250
much more passion behind you probably
and that's huge whenever we're looking

451
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,520
at hiring someone you know it's very
easy for us to fill out you know if

452
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,290
their technical or not but for me it's a
passion about what they're doing because

453
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,840
when a customer calls us and they want
to talk about their environment or talk

454
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,389
about it is spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars hopefully then

455
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:31,020
there there's a lot of there's a lot of
things in motion there there's no Mi

456
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,550
really brings some kind of expertise to
the table and I really instilling some

457
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,840
kind of change in their environment and
are they really gonna be better when I

458
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,490
leave or am I just another you know joe
shmoe on the block was gonna do a

459
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,670
service and walk away so the passion is
it is a big one because without the

460
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,890
passion you're not going to care about
what youre talking about and I always

461
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,280
make the make the claim that if I'm
having a conversation with a customer

462
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,760
and I care more about their environment
they do then they're not the right

463
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,850
customer for us they can call someone
else and I'm sure you guys will agree

464
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,669
with that right if if they don't care
enough about their environment then I'm

465
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,230
not gonna waste my time

466
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:07,900
devoting that much to their environment
because I have other customers I haven't

467
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,270
gotten to yet so much rather spend my
time with them the other day I'm going

468
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,450
to kill me no more proud about their
environment and what I've built and

469
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,480
someone who just got a falling back on
the sorting going here we'll get to that

470
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,990
when we get to it so short quick talk
but i wanna leave sometime over the end

471
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,679
the kind of talk about their similar to
what some of the stuff they was talking

472
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,320
about but you know really what we see
currently in the industry and then where

473
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,480
we can make some changes and if you guys
have questions about getting into the

474
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,990
consultancy consultancies and and and
operating and you know something that's

475
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,130
been very passionate for us for a long
time you know we're here to answer

476
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,240
questions about it so that's that's all
I've got hopefully you guys got

477
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,240
something out of that russians

478
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:17,879
change because media media brings
awareness and so there's there's the

479
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,368
it's the best conversations I like to
have our customers especially repeat

480
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:27,419
customers are the ones that come to us
and go I wanna do this or i heard about

481
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,549
this let's try something new and so
those are always great because now we

482
00:34:31,549 --> 00:34:35,228
feel like we have an overall inside the
organization they're the ones coming to

483
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:38,739
us going well we didn't do this last
year let's open up you know the scope of

484
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:43,449
it was open up services of it and so
it's always good to to see customers

485
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:48,589
having the same passion and creativity
for well you know I thought about you

486
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:52,619
know we did this last year and we did ok
but maybe we open up you know fishing to

487
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:56,369
all the business units now or maybe we
do a physical security system because

488
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:01,729
you never done one before so it's seeing
that kind of passion creativity inside

489
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:04,558
organization tells us that we're doing
something right

490
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,559
change in the industry

491
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:47,119
regurgitate yeah it's tough I think the
right to be able to meet to change

492
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,469
things like that is trying to identify
some of those things up front what we

493
00:35:51,469 --> 00:35:52,349
talked about right

494
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:56,819
you know where where do we want to take
this right we can all you know have you

495
00:35:56,819 --> 00:36:00,849
sign a check in and do the job and walk
away we're done but is there gonna be

496
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:04,839
any differences when I leave and so
understanding the environment becomes

497
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,739
important in the beginning you know what
are the politics there or they're going

498
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:13,609
to be in a roadblocks along the way and
and all the things that we try and and

499
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:18,299
highlight any time we're doing testing
is instead of us having their free reign

500
00:36:18,299 --> 00:36:21,469
on the network for we can we get done to
give you a report about these things

501
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:27,109
along the way as we gain access and get
more privileged access I like to to

502
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:30,219
change direction based on what the
business is looking for other areas that

503
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:33,839
we can bring extra focus to other areas
that you've been telling the business

504
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,140
for two or three years now to fix and
they're tired of hearing you talk but if

505
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,799
a consultant tells you it's a bit
different that's kind of where it goes

506
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:44,288
when management shaping that report they
want someone else to be the microphone

507
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:49,940
so we we tried to that ethically by sane
or the areas are you have an improved in

508
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,979
your mom yet

509
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:53,759
well yeah we've got the small cluster
over here that we can get up there for

510
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:57,219
two years it's running you know our our
CRM and our customer information

511
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:01,349
whatever else and so if there's if
there's areas that we know the business

512
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:06,150
is getting complacent will spend extra
time they're focusing but we try and

513
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,880
stop it with them telling us how to
write the report them telling us what

514
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,420
information is to be in the report

515
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,420
you know that's the you have to draw the
line there right to say this is what we

516
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,089
need to focus on I'm gonna tell you I
got their recommendations on how to fix

517
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:22,549
it it's your call he would have
conversations after that but at the end

518
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:28,779
the day there's there's very little I
guess forcing the hand if you will of

519
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:34,279
how we're going to relay the information
and and we've been not only the

520
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:37,469
fortunate enough to be able to do that
with customers and if customers ask us

521
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:40,949
to do something comfortable in there not
a customer anymore there's a lot of

522
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:43,140
companies out there that will do that
they'll take the check

523
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,710
customer says the report they asked for
and they'll call next year they'll keep

524
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,100
doing business but if if I had that
feeling with a customer that they're

525
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,240
they're looking for for me to become
just a a microphone for their you know

526
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,279
their predefined route they want to take
usually we try to stop that early

527
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:34,920
yeah so whenever we're doing exactly
what you said there's there's the

528
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:39,840
symptomatic issues of patches missing
and install this patch but that's a

529
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:44,480
custom game you're playing so anytime
we're looking at environment we try to

530
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
identify things at a route calls right
why these matches missing in the first

531
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,410
place is packed solution broken is the
validation side broken is the business

532
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,399
not pushing patches on the right amount
of time is the process broken is the

533
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,620
skill sets deficient in in the areas
that that they are trying to focus all

534
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,430
of our ability program so all those
things can become a factor of you know

535
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,960
why these patches are missing in the
first place

536
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,800
installing patches are always gonna be
an operational issue but why are they

537
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:20,510
missing is really the question so
there's it's a probably more than 50% of

538
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,940
the time the issues are either with too
much technology and I love people to

539
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,490
manage it or they have the wrong
technology to do some of those things

540
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,149
and it is probably because they have the
right you know sales people that they

541
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,640
were talking to in the first place they
sell them something with a blinking

542
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,470
light and you know marketing slick that
said it was stopped a hundred percent of

543
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:50,750
all tax or the vaccine but it's having
this conversation the beginning is

544
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,570
probably what went wrong because he they
were sold their own technology or they

545
00:39:54,570 --> 00:40:09,240
bought technology that in have the
resources to support the arts in the

546
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,529
first couple years we were hesitant
about turning business down but it's

547
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:17,690
gotten to a point now where I mean we're
small company were 10% shop and everyone

548
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,290
is a contestant on the team so there's
not a lot of overhead and things like

549
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:27,250
that but because of that in the
beginning it's hard to tell somebody to

550
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,890
take their 22030 granted go somewhere
else because you're paying salaries and

551
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:38,609
keep the lights on as you as you grow
and and and you build a reputation that

552
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:43,920
to me and my partner is much much more
important than us just making money we

553
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,500
could easily go be a much bigger company
tomorrow and higher budget people and

554
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,910
get more contracts but at some point
your value and reputations gonna change

555
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:56,240
and so we've always had a reputation of
you know a finding people at times

556
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,140
because we're very honest but also
telling them that we're not interested

557
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,180
in working with him anymore and so it's
you don't find that a lot I know David

558
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:12,240
would cost jobs are you done it to its
that's rare these days are industry

559
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,089
because everyone's out you know be more
popular make more money get more

560
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:21,330
customers possibly get ballclub your
company and so the the goals are

561
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,140
different for a lot of those companies
and for us is more important for us to

562
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,210
have the right class because we only
have so much time every year to do the

563
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:32,790
work and so I'd much rather spend that
time with a customer that's gonna have

564
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,990
you know get some value out of it than
just filling that spot with someone

565
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,990
that's not

566
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:07,060
I think that we don't see in our
industry is people checking references

567
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,460
to know if you were if you were to put a
roof on your house take that analogy

568
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,250
again you'd probably at least get one or
two references may be some of your

569
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:18,390
neighborhood and talk to them about the
quality of work that they had and every

570
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,348
once in a while customers will ask us
for those but usually there in some kind

571
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:25,140
of the process and it's just you know
that's a requirement on their their

572
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,830
bidding process see references I think
her huge one you know we don't do that

573
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:34,290
enough is so anytime someone asked us
you know is there in its rare with a 10

574
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,820
percent of the time we get asked
references so I'd like to see more of

575
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,810
that you know there's always that the
issue of well they're gonna call a

576
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,029
friend of the sky and their friends and
a stellar review but you know you did

577
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,859
the same thing you're hired somebody you
check their references to check their

578
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:52,299
employment history so what I do that
with your consultancy the other piece of

579
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:58,200
it is you know what do they do outside
of the 825 you know are they are the

580
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,149
instrumental in the industry that we
operate in because in reality our

581
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,270
community is pretty small if if they've
been in the industry for you know three

582
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,480
four five years chances are you probably
know I'm early can call someone who does

583
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,430
know so when you're talking to when
you're talking to new shops and a new

584
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:17,470
names it's good to kick the tires and
ask her out

585
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,790
references are big and then what do they
do outside you are they do they

586
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,920
represent do they go to conferences do
they do things like you know the the

587
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,710
standardization stuff that we were doing
as a community all those things I think

588
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,770
become valuable because it shows you
that they have a passion of what they're

589
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,770
doing this I just need to file Form

590
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:59,480
if customers have never had a test their
very apprehensive about it so there's a

591
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,920
lot of kind of rules that you have to
find out front and I'll ask questions

592
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,509
that you know laughs at but you know you
have to answer me know anything down are

593
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:11,079
you you're not gonna deal dude in our
service right and so all these things

594
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:17,059
that we try to limit impact the business
so you know there's there's the you know

595
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:19,980
I can tell you that nothing's gonna go
down but that's certainly not our

596
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,480
attention so those kinds of questions
get asked with new customers have never

597
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,519
really gone through that kind of service
the ones I think there are probably more

598
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:31,890
relevant for what you're asking us if
we're doing things like physical

599
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:37,170
security what are the rules there are we
allowed to bring in after hours are we

600
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:41,329
allowed to you know press the guards a
bit or is there a chance that they're

601
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:44,460
going to you know have maicer stun gun
or something and possibly you know she

602
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,359
one of us in the parking lot so there's
there's always those questions that we

603
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:54,380
have to define but that's more around a
safety and protection issue for the

604
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,980
business I think the only ones that that
kind of calm his curveball sometimes is

605
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:05,390
how are we going to protect their
information right because the goal of

606
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:09,140
our test is to steal their stuff and
they pay us to give it all back pretty

607
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:15,160
much as they did we make anyway but when
when they've never really had a lot of

608
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,190
their services and in the requesting
that they're very nervous about it

609
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:23,460
naturally so there's a lot of of
protection and then rules that come into

610
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,279
play sometimes with how my passwords
how's my databases how's my customer

611
00:45:27,279 --> 00:45:28,049
information

612
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:31,259
how's the PIAA going to interact with
how this is protected once it leaves my

613
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:35,710
campus so those become more kind of
defined in the rules of engagement as

614
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,299
well

615
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:37,970
cryptid and all those kinds of things
