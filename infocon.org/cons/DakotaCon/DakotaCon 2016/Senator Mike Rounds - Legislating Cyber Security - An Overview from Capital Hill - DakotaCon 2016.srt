1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,070
without further ado please come said
Mike rounds this great thanks Josh

2
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:25,859
good afternoon now check right I thought
to be careful so before I came in and

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,580
turned myself on office not couldn't be
happier but let me just begin by saying

4
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,480
I want to thank you to Dakota State
University for hosting the 2016 as one

5
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,910
of the many sponsors will help to make
this conference to reality we just try

6
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,069
right now I am NOT an expert in any way
shape or form with regards to anything

7
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,750
to do with cybersecurity but i wanna lay
this out in terms of a perspective from

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,440
someone who is in the united states
senate who cares about what it means to

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,480
our country so today on a per say thank
you to all those sponsors are helping

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,878
make this thing work and most
importantly I want to express my

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,030
gratitude to all of you and the audience
for your contribution is to

12
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,619
cybersecurity 21st century whether you
are a professor a student or a crack in

13
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:19,689
the property sector you are working to
address one of the foremost issues we

14
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:22,298
find ourselves with today

15
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,220
protecting our citizens our
infrastructure and our military from

16
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,939
cyberattacks must be a top priority for
the federal government it is achievable

17
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,419
but it will require the cooperation

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,920
the pentagon the Department of Homeland
Security and perhaps most importantly

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
the private sector are crucial role in
providing security in the cyber world

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,729
the Kodokan advertisers have that as up
to code is premier security event all in

21
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,939
the middle of a corn field any of you in
the audience with DSU success story

22
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,449
that's why we're here to give back to
help to train the next generation and to

23
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,780
learn from one another and we can
emphasize enough the Dakota State

24
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,310
University's a national model of success
to producing our futures

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,030
workforce 2019 just three years from now

26
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,400
Mike Brown Michael Brown the CEO of
cybersecurity workforce demand will rise

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,470
to six million individuals with a
projected shortfall of 1.5 million so

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,470
there's going to be a huge demand for
all of you

29
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,840
us' Cyber Command in particular is
seeking to recruit four thousand cyber

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,170
professionals to assemble a hundred and
thirty three teens with various missions

31
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,959
by the year 2018 not adequately protect
our nation's networks and maintainer

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,260
information security dominance in the
future we must make certain our

33
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,880
workforce is increased demands immediate
just exactly that right here in South

34
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,730
one of the three TDs you students
studied computer science for

35
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,280
cybersecurity in some capacity

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,800
2012 the University esteem eighty-three
percent increase in students majoring in

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,730
one of its three cybersecurity majors
the issue is also the first college in

38
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,970
the United States to offer a major in
cybersecurity it is one of 14 universes

39
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,620
endorsed by the National Security Agency
as a center of academic experts in cyber

40
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,970
security operations and proud of all the
work

41
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,230
yes use leadership professors and
students are doing to become a national

42
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,869
leader in cybersecurity education and
training this success is a result of the

43
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,220
committed faculty and universities
leadership's efforts to integrate

44
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,040
technology into the culture of the
entire campus Dakota State University's

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,640
leadership has proven that universities
in rural states can provide a

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,309
world-class program and students to
prepare them for high demand 21st

47
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:58,580
century jobs today I've been asked about
legislating cybersecurity but really I

48
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,440
want to focus on how we congress can
work with you

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:09,000
who are truly the the experts to produce
sound cybersecurity policy congress were

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,990
pulled in many different policy
directions every single day

51
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:18,280
those of you in the audience and are the
experts in the trenches addressing cyber

52
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,559
security on a daily basis

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,490
expertise on these issues is valuable
and must be a part of any congressional

54
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,250
plate of effort and Congress must work
to be more inclusive one legislating

55
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,670
cyber security after all congress simply
makes the law you are the ones who will

56
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:44,650
be most affected one of bill goes into
effect so after my remarks like happy to

57
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,630
take your questions are more interested
in hearing from you on how we can better

58
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,520
address challenges that being said let
me quickly update you on what we're

59
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,690
working on in congress related to cyber
at this time with the bipartisan

60
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,300
payments innovation caucus which I'm
co-chairing was senator Gary Peters of

61
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,560
Michigan the goal of the caucuses to
explore new and innovative technologies

62
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,580
in the payments industry and to address
how we can protect our online payments

63
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,609
from cyber threats this is especially
important to me because I had a South

64
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,540
Dakota has been a leader and innovator
in the payments industry the technology

65
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,419
payments industry impacts nearly every
corner and is changing rapidly growing

66
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:34,039
as technology has expanded the reach of
mobile payments South Dakota's role in

67
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,230
the world economy has grown
substantially as well

68
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,090
still falls has been called on that
credit built and a few months ago I

69
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,539
visited a startup company in rapid city
that is rolling out a new point of sale

70
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,990
device that uses biometric data to
authorize a payment I'm proud of South

71
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,330
Dakota's leading role in payments
innovation yet it highlights the need to

72
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,590
keep consumer data safe from hackers by
enacting for security measures to combat

73
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,400
online threats

74
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,190
goal with this system make sure that all
interested parties are

75
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,849
the issue

76
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:18,569
to meet growing consumer data safe and
secure one piece of cybersecurity

77
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:24,069
legislation in which we've listened to
industry to craft was the Cyber Security

78
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,909
Information Sharing after sites which
passed the Senate with my support was

79
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:33,360
signed into law last december many
others in congress understand the size

80
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,219
is not a cure all for the cyber security
but what it does offer is a voluntary

81
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:43,889
program for businesses to participate in
cyber threat information sharing with

82
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,089
appropriate liability protections I
welcome comments from the audience as to

83
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:53,419
how this legislation could be improved
mood as well as offer alternative policy

84
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,758
options to improve cybersecurity
condition congress also recently passed

85
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,369
the North Korea sanctions in policy
enhancement act with my support it was

86
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:09,679
in the 18th of this year this law
empowers jus Treasury Department to

87
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,659
freeze the assets of North Korean
entities who engage in significant

88
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:18,490
malicious cyber security activity this
law and the Treasury Department

89
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,649
sanctioning authority sets a precedent
and expands the tools available to the

90
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,879
us- government to respond to a
significant malicious cyber security

91
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,029
attack while these efforts are step in
the right direction

92
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:36,619
more must be done congress must work to
establish business-friendly rules that

93
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:43,139
can be used for private sector and the
federal government we must incentive

94
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,300
look sector to in an increasing its
network security we must find

95
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,960
for clarity on missile tools for
cybersecurity professionals can do their

96
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,229
job with confidence and we must also a
cyber threats under the national

97
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,960
security umbrella as a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee we have

98
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,780
been looking intensely as tiber threats
from a national security perspective on

99
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,940
the 21st century it doesn't take a large
army or the latest knowledge to tap into

100
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,100
a nation's critical infrastructure which
could do

101
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,690
nation's entire economy and
significantly disrupt daily life as our

102
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,240
enemies tactics grows more sophisticated
we must be even more diligent in our

103
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,560
defense this brings into question the
role of the defense department with

104
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,978
regard to cybersecurity important
component of the United States national

105
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:49,040
security policy just having our country
and what particular event after

106
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,900
countless armed service meetings and
briefings I found our readiness in the

107
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,600
study were dominating lacking congress
now you determine what constitutes an

108
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,740
act of war in the cyber domain it needs
to do so before and attackers to enable

109
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,750
the pentagon to respond in real time
since cyber attacks happened literally

110
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,940
in seconds

111
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,600
cyberattack does not allow time for
deliberation and debate as is the case

112
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,660
and potential warfare in my view a
cyberattack on critical infrastructure

113
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,050
that causes physical means in effect

114
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:30,079
kinetic attack could be considered an
armed attack what I want a response to

115
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,519
the pentagon can respond to an attack on
its own networks as it has the right to

116
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,800
self-defense the standing rules of
engagement to fire when fired upon but

117
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,819
these are defensive actions it is also
critical for the defense department to

118
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,690
have the offensive maybe call it courage
strength capability to deter attack on

119
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,190
critical infrastructure such an attack
can already be perpetrated by a number

120
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:04,190
of state actors countries in particular
one day if not already non-state actor

121
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:11,240
may also have the ability to mount such
attack that's a cyberattack must be a

122
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,370
major focus to the Defense Department's
doctrine and operational planning we

123
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,279
have made some progress 2010 when the
defendant Deputy Defense Secretary

124
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:30,790
William Lynn stated boredom as the
public about its separate space as a new

125
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,760
dominating of warfare end of quote I
believe we are now striving to determine

126
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:45,550
how to best operate in this domain and
doing so the pentagon faces a number of

127
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,380
challenging issues as it undertakes
roles such as blocking foreign hackers

128
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,200
targeting domestic systems assisting us'
combat troops overseas defending

129
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,100
military networks just touch on a few of
the challenges first is the need

130
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,200
operationalize space that means creating
command and control systems that enable

131
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,900
operators are integrated with other
military capabilities based on a

132
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:16,220
situational awareness second channel
just formulating maintaining determine

133
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,910
strategies as the range of actors and
capabilities continue to evolve rapidly

134
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,579
and very unpredictably

135
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,050
challenge and one of particular interest
to me is clarification of the pentagon's

136
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,949
authority to respond to the attacks on
critical infrastructure in the days

137
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,650
ahead I look forward to working with my
arms services committee colleagues in

138
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:49,610
helping defense department meet these
challenges in time maybe short according

139
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,610
to reports the terrorists responsible
for the recent tax and Paris use

140
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,000
statistical data encryption attempts to
communicate and carry out their attacks

141
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,870
this proves that our enemies
technological capabilities are growing

142
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,710
more sophisticated and some ways we face
a situation which is not unlike the

143
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:12,280
situation our armed forces and the
latest in the run-up to ww2 at that time

144
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,540
our army or navy were compelled to
rapidly acquire and operationalize new

145
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,250
military technologies and their
associated operational concepts they

146
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,020
were compelled to do so in the face of
potential enemies who are already for

147
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,819
advanced and adoption of such
revolutionary technologies and concepts

148
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:35,960
I see it as my job and the job of my
colleagues to make sure we get it right

149
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,260
sooner this time one example of

150
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,939
improve cyber to the Department of
Defense cyber support to civil

151
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,510
authorities act of 2010 which I offered
last year

152
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,900
the provisions of this bill were
included in the National Defense

153
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,390
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016
this provision which is natural law will

154
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,540
require a comprehensive plan for us'
Cyber Command to support civil

155
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,860
authorities in responding to cyber
attacks by foreign powers against the

156
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,550
United States its contribution is but a
small steps to increasing our

157
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:18,640
preparedness importantly any national
defense cyber strategy must be must be

158
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,140
under delayed by a solid core of
cybersecurity professionals who can

159
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,580
implement that strategy talking about
you when that in mind I recently

160
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:34,670
introduced the Cyber Command employment
personal training act of 2016 this bill

161
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,469
would improve the Department of Defense
hiring practices for cybersecurity

162
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,400
professionals by making certain that the
department's hiring officials are

163
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,890
trained under the rules for hiring and
pay flexibility for civilian

164
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:57,270
cybersecurity employees these rules
permit faster hiring and higher pay for

165
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,120
these employees than is normally the
case for the us- civil service improving

166
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,540
the training for hiring officials at the
Department of Defense who play a vital

167
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,069
role in the hiring of civilian
cybersecurity professionals can help

168
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:21,710
assure the us- military is working with
the best possible additionally I won

169
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,250
hands the defender the Defense
Department's

170
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:31,600
qualified cybersecurity professionals
from schools such as DSU specifically

171
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,730
the bill will require training dept
level human resources staff that manages

172
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,520
the civilian workforce trained staff
that right

173
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,780
implementing guidance for hiring and pay
flexibilities and also training

174
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,480
supervisors and hiring managers

175
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,579
use or would use the flexibilities in
that are allowed within this bill there

176
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:00,680
is a great amount of work to be done to
meet the many challenges of

177
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,510
cybersecurity but I really believe I'm
confident that we can meet these

178
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,689
challenges just tells our can do
American spirit found in our nation's

179
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:19,240
settled the west won two World Wars and
put a man on the moon stop cyber world

180
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:29,829
again its threats and military and the
most women like you committed to

181
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:35,959
addressing cyber security in the 21st
century helped the Kodokan 2016 has

182
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:41,180
further dialogue for all of you how we
can best protect our citizens our

183
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,899
military and the federal government from
cyber threats

184
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,320
well that just opened this up then I'd
be happy to answer any questions you may

185
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,290
have gathered here I know that you've
got some competition and so forth going

186
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:02,920
on later in the dance of course the
leading edge of something here that the

187
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,519
folks to understand and learn about and
in doing so we're trying to integrate

188
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:13,240
into what we saw from the challenges
that we still were trying to integrate

189
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,389
ways in which we can utilize the talents
that you're developing in many in many

190
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:23,910
cases are so with that let me just
opened the stuff you've got questions

191
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,720
sought advice I would be more than happy
to have this time yes

192
00:16:39,290 --> 00:17:21,290
gonna come before congress now has a
case without security experts security

193
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,280
experts have found a way to get into it
and now I notice that Apple single women

194
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:33,730
how to do that one way that we might
want to talk about this and we had a

195
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,690
little bit of discussion this earlier in
the day there are the good guys who

196
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,690
would love to figure

197
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,050
getting in and around Andheri normally
would be considered private but how do

198
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,760
you identify who the good guys are we're
trying to find ways to get in and fix

199
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,800
things versus the guys who are trying to
get in to be able to take advantage of

200
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:04,750
44 inappropriate purposes may be one way
is to identify who the good guys up to

201
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,270
help them identify themselves and in
doing so to provide some sort of

202
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,090
protection for them getting the end as
long as there's some point in the future

203
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:19,760
where they clearly have to identify that
they've gotten in and share what those

204
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:27,260
what those holes are how they did it I
knew this is not something that that

205
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,210
congress have found ourselves facing on
a daily basis

206
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:40,950
years and years of privacy years and in
many cases in which had been legislated

207
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:49,120
a constitutional discussion about about
personal rights sold new for us and no

208
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,290
part of it is learning just exactly what
the thought process Armada what is

209
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,850
private what is not private and someone
has the capability to get into it do

210
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,189
they have an obligation to notify folks
that they've got a a door or window open

211
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:10,820
so I used to be that that I mean streets
around and check all the doors and

212
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:17,240
windows of of mercantile establishments
but the walkout Lehigh

213
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,240
mercantile

214
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:29,580
around check doors windows and they walk
into you don't have to open a walk I

215
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,439
don't make the call the orange to hey
left front door open when you left your

216
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,779
back door opener teacup windows open
down here

217
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:41,919
charged with breaking and entering
expected that was part of what they did

218
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,870
but they were identified up front and
they were like I don't know if there's

219
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,080
any possibility on something like that
or not but there may be two

220
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,240
possibilities that would work because
we've we've clearly entered a new rain

221
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,200
are you know we've entered into a new
era where you've got folks with

222
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:05,990
capabilities in education and tell us
that can be used for question is how do

223
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,669
we access and I'm not sure if I'm out
from the question I really think we have

224
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:17,590
to talk about I like the idea that I had
said look we're not gonna get any

225
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:25,189
information regarding cryptosystem here
and if we did that encrypted it's no

226
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,440
longer as solid as it was before but I
also surprising move in this was that it

227
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,539
wasn't as encrypted is what they thought
it was it wasn't as secure as they

228
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,440
thought it was it would have been broken
so now the next question is is it simply

229
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,899
a run up to where there's gotta be
multiple lines of defense once again and

230
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:49,049
is going to be an ever-changing
technology and is gonna go in where

231
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,620
every three months you gonna get a new
update from Apple from someone else

232
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,139
saying you've got a new series of here
that we think you ought to get in and

233
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:59,158
you're gonna love you too

234
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,660
phone saying there's no question that we
cannot use for a while I think that's

235
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:10,000
what we're going to see is going to be
it's gonna be a strategy you know we can

236
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,790
make it better or gonna make it faster
gonna make it bigger just like we've

237
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,740
seen in defense strategies with regard
to first second third fourth and fifth

238
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:25,580
generation fighter aircraft bomber so
that the race is I don't have a better

239
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,720
answer right now but that series mara
here is to say look we gotta learn about

240
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,990
it you folks are going to live with it

241
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,520
folks understand better than we did if
you can help by giving us information

242
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,620
maybe you can stop us from doing the
image by writing the wrong kind of a law

243
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:46,469
and if we try to write in a void will
make a mistake as much as anything else

244
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,550
look at it and tell us what can be done
what can't be done what you see is right

245
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:57,990
and what is an appropriate way to try to
legislate language that can hurt our

246
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,310
ability to protect the security of this
country yesterday

247
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:48,899
could be done at the time because what
can pass the House of Representatives to

248
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,520
matter what can pass the House of
Representatives and the Senate and the

249
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,520
House of Representatives which is
primarily republican

250
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:02,260
the folks together Kim making people in
the senate it's not that way it takes

251
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,190
sixty percent which means you gotta have
republicans and democrats side-by-side

252
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:13,080
agreeing to something so it slows the
process down it allows for more

253
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,110
discussion to occur but when it's all
said and done in a matter of what can

254
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:24,100
both parties agree is something that is
livable today when it was all said and

255
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,129
done this was the closest thing that we
could come up with something that those

256
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,570
individuals who were directly involved
in the negotiations that was the closest

257
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,169
thing that they could get and it is not
perfect in the Baltic I doubt that the

258
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,350
company was perfect but they thought
they had moved the ball forward someone

259
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:48,870
and that Odyssey is the way that in the
senate you'll find most items addressed

260
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,969
he'll never be perfect for one side or
the other and you'll have a very strong

261
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,470
points of view on your side but it'll
never even get to the floor unless you

262
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,100
have 60 votes out of a hundred that even
agree to discuss the bill in the first

263
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:11,270
place in other words in the senate just
to debate the discussion on site before

264
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,480
you up

265
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,290
people agree out of a hundred that they
would begin to and what's happened over

266
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:24,379
the last couple of decades is it what
their deal made before they ever get her

267
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,429
to the floor and then once it gets to
allow either party would allow the 60

268
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:33,780
votes to happen they want most of it put
together and then once they get it to

269
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,660
the floor

270
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,929
discussions based upon the rules are set
aside for each separate bill that comes

271
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:44,450
up in my database going all out for ten
amendments were going all out for 30

272
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:50,610
minutes per side or call it whatever the
group's decide on before they ask for

273
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:55,260
the 60 votes count and then once that
happened and it's brought to the floor

274
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,960
maisonette rules in place you may help
small and large members are debated but

275
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,679
you still need all said and done in
order to stop debate on the middle of

276
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,570
600

277
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,689
heard from their constituents have heard
the positives and the negatives

278
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:15,330
outweighed his ass better than what it
was before this particular case ended up

279
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,549
with was a group of folks out there said
look we know it's not perfect but at

280
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:23,210
least we move the ball forward for more
will be given a chance to take the next

281
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,660
steps and in many cases that happens
speakers during certain folks within

282
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,290
each conference that have more expertise
in an area than others do and the more

283
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,780
of those individuals that you can make
contact with and share that information

284
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:42,460
the better off you are in a lot of cases
what happens in the senate brand new

285
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,210
I've been there for a year out of the
determination about whether or not a

286
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:53,350
bill is good or not is based upon who is
sponsoring a bill and credible

287
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,780
discussion from those individuals who
are having expertise on the stuff you

288
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,990
like into out into the standard and you
have a discussion to do with a

289
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,790
particular area most of the central said
well you really need to talk to someone

290
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,889
so because they've got expertise in this
area and move you gotta get them on your

291
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,790
side in this particular case the folks
who are working on the phone so far too

292
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,750
stepped into it

293
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,690
had enough expertise to credibility and
say look we know it's not perfect but

294
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,410
it's the best thing we can break now we
would recommend that you vote for it but

295
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,290
we're gonna have to come back and read
russell again and that's what happened

296
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:41,889
what else to go all the way in the back
yesterday

297
00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:17,790
they were in violation of a current
federal law when they did it and whether

298
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,730
or not they had gone into trying to
negotiate the deal with the Department

299
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,350
of Justice before before the end so they
can get into it so you're giving me some

300
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:30,020
new information that I did not know
before I walked in and if they could do

301
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,879
it outside of the country once again
here's a case of where you say the

302
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,200
country is illegal but if you go outside
the country you can do it you can bring

303
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,250
it back on another way to skin this
thing and I didn't realize it was that

304
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,170
particular case but I was one of the
questions we had had earlier this

305
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,210
morning we were discussing how they got
past that point whether or not they

306
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,200
picked up immunity before they ever did
it so thank you for sharing that I'm

307
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,200
learning a lot of questions are yes

308
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:32,150
talk about whether or not you're
creating a long are you creating a crime

309
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:39,780
and whether or not you want the question
is who is responsible for the data

310
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,310
breach it becomes more complicated
because you have multiple multiple

311
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:49,429
enemies may be responsible and I'm not
sure if I'm going on the same path that

312
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,160
you're wondering about but let me just
give you an example in our innovations

313
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,170
caucus car payments innovations caucus
if you have a data breach right now if

314
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,920
you talk to the banks are saying you
know our systems are pretty much we're

315
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,910
getting pretty good with it but we're
pushing merchants if you take a look at

316
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,370
where the data breaches have occurred
over at the working level by the

317
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:15,270
merchants channellock we're using are
using tanks they're the ones that really

318
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:21,730
should be should be filed on the stuff
up now they've got a good points but now

319
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,890
do you make a corporation criminally
liable for something or do you simply

320
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:31,970
say there is a 90 on simply laughable if
you've got a problem on it it's one

321
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,480
thing to have to pay back into and to
make people whole

322
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,520
have been damaged by a breach of
Obstetrics cost someone something but do

323
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,220
you then make a criminal offense you're
talking about an entirely different and

324
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,400
I think that's why we were part of the
question is do take someone who is

325
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,600
really the victim and you now say
because you are the victim on this thing

326
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,820
you didn't have appropriate security in
place we were not charged with a crime

327
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:03,399
yet I'm not sure you gonna go far with
it that way is that what you're

328
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,539
wondering about

329
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:17,080
would try to do is to make it easier for
businesses that find where they've been

330
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,908
breached to share with one another and
in doing the sharing to make sure that

331
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:26,509
there are not privacy issues that if
they can keep the privacy of the

332
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:29,909
individuals mister released the data
that it's not considered a breach of

333
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:33,309
privacy to allow them to share with
other entities who may be in the same

334
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:37,549
boat but what happened and how they got
in we're trying to make it easier for

335
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:40,200
them to do so and that's what the
legislature has been focused on the

336
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,859
fastest to make it easier for businesses
to share that data that once that

337
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:48,210
happens in one place it doesn't happen
again and again that's been the focus so

338
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,210
far but not guaranteed

339
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,760
and it's gonna take folks asking
questions about how you put the pressure

340
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,600
on folks to make it better and then

341
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,699
harming them to where they say generally
not offer that service of also gonna be

342
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,390
criminally liable should somebody get in
Bridgend make me a victim but then I'm

343
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,750
responsible as a victim for what
somebody else is there is there any

344
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,390
level of competency which is expected

345
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:20,290
ok liability gross negligence and then
you have negligence they did you get to

346
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:24,100
the point of gross negligence on
something you may very well have some

347
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,800
criminal issues involved in it but if
you simply have negligence means your

348
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,700
best job which didn't do anything
intentionally wrong

349
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,160
the difference between the two perhaps
sometime in the future and this is where

350
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,590
you folks step it is there a way to
determine gross negligence when it comes

351
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:48,889
to security is there a way to identify
negligence person is that something I

352
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,690
think whatever you do when it comes to
security breaches and so forth because

353
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,510
of the interstate commerce clause
information that goes on across state

354
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:03,730
lines would be much better off to have a
national standard as opposed to a a

355
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,730
state stander

356
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:12,389
ok

357
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:38,929
the federal government they've come in
they work with me

358
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:43,460
they've been assured that they've got
coverage if you don't protection but

359
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:54,870
that data has a real question by side
with all due respect I don't trust any

360
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,870
of the federal government and I
absolutely have to

361
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,070
and the reason is because I have no
reason to believe that there that there

362
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,919
any better than anybody else had keeping
at keeping data secure and I think

363
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,510
they're just as vulnerable as anybody
else is when it comes to act as part of

364
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:17,360
the problem we've got right now you know
you take a look at the at the payroll

365
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,100
records and you take a look at the
personal information that's been lost so

366
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:30,520
far but i buy out about a fairly large
number of individual people I know are

367
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,410
under the folks in my office they are
about the fact that for the rest of the

368
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:38,000
lies you gonna wonder when it shows up
personal information and their families

369
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,540
and I was irritated me we were all mad
about it and you wonder how in the world

370
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,970
can this kind of data breach happened to
the federal government who is telling

371
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,920
the rest of us what we're supposed to be
doing talking about what we're gonna

372
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,540
make people share more information with
the federal government there's a group

373
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,240
of dust and it's fairly large group that
says had time out here for a second

374
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,010
44 gonna be doing her daughter will be
able to offer some additional assurances

375
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:15,020
that the data that we we can protect it
and some double checks on you don't let

376
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,050
me just step in and one thing and then I
i dont im going past my time but I

377
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:28,490
there's something here its oversight
responsibilities that really good

378
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:35,388
oversight and it's something that we're
going to talk more about I believe but

379
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:38,940
everyone so we get frustrated because
even though were congress

380
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:43,190
times we don't do a good job and
oversight because in many cases with

381
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,460
limitations but what we can do we can
bring it up we can talk about it I was a

382
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,839
kid in overtime

383
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,679
Corps of Engineers we're talking about
the fact that they had a major flood in

384
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:57,839
2011 in fact I call it the core flood of
2011

385
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,059
they they had major water come into the
base in the upper Missouri River Basin

386
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:13,069
in in 10 11 and March April and May and
in doing so they weren't prepared for it

387
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:18,250
and they had a major flood in fact it
was over the banks were probably close

388
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:24,250
to three months will be looking to see
how this happened and you go back in

389
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:28,230
there they can give you reports and
studies and one of the report said you

390
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:33,109
know we just didn't have enough about
how much water was coming in and back in

391
00:35:33,109 --> 00:35:38,549
2014 they can we gotta have her we've
gotta put in more water monitoring we

392
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:43,359
gotta find out how much the soil can
hold how much moisture in the soil back

393
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,808
we got how much water we've got coming
down to the creek saw the tributaries

394
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:52,400
two years but now they need all this
additional information in order to be

395
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,619
able to accurately determine how quick
the water's coming in 2014 their

396
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:04,160
authorized under what they call an
inward it directed them along with a

397
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,848
couple of the department to put together
to come back in and lay out a plan to

398
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:09,279
get all the stuff ready to go

399
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:15,160
they help riding yesterday we just
haven't done anything because we don't

400
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,000
have the money from congress

401
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,440
what you mean you don't have the money
from congress he helped write the bill

402
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:29,650
has been talkin 14 2014 2015 2016 the
present study laid out his proposal for

403
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,670
appropriations for 2017 when my
oversight responsibility I'm saying you

404
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,549
can come in three years you're supposed
to have this report you suggest you've

405
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:43,220
got a report coming in nineteen have the
audacity to suggest to us that you don't

406
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,019
have the money to get a report done to
tell us how much money you need in order

407
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:47,910
to put it

408
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,089
are trying to fight in the first place

409
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:53,390
how can you live in making
appropriations request unless you've

410
00:36:53,390 --> 00:37:01,420
done the study no response so here's a
case of where oversight is there but we

411
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,770
don't have much of an authority here
except up slap them on the wrist bring

412
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,829
about it publicly talk about it publicly
and then pull back and so they go back

413
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:12,720
to their daily lives again and say well
we went through that again we got our

414
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,140
butts chewed alone and life is good
except this time it's not gonna be

415
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:20,029
because now we're going to go back in
and we're gonna chase this thing up a

416
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,069
battered put it we talk about the
oversight and I'm getting off a little

417
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:30,259
bit but I think the federal gov online
collection of data they can make

418
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,280
mistakes but unless we have a system of
oversight to ask the questions and then

419
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,329
to get a response in a timely fashion
about what they're doing to fix it and

420
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:43,410
make sure that when they tell us they're
gonna fix it they actually do or there

421
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:50,299
will be repercussions for just go on the
bureaucracy will continue on sober me

422
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:57,579
voluntarily provide personal data
absolutely not if you're required to you

423
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:00,670
you're required to vote then we've got
an additional obligation to try to keep

424
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:06,010
it safe and that's where we need your
help you're the expert on this thing and

425
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:12,150
hire the best and the brightest and
