1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,540
apologize still having kind of a crappy
slide deck a problem

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,570
promised that its my research as I said
you but then I decided it was a good

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,310
idea once I got in at midnight last
night to not go to bed so 4 a.m. and go

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,419
to the local gas station next American
in and order one of everything on the

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:33,590
menu so I didn't have a chance to switch
it to a black background and also was

6
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:39,510
gonna do a live demo with HSAs are that
they felt that I don't have the

7
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,820
appropriate prescription for it they're
probably right but we got some good

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:55,980
stuff where area so when I currently
associate director medical device

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,349
healthcare security is there anybody
local area that health care of folks

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,340
here that's good

11
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,640
anybody go to the hospital so we all
have something home and get over 15

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,430
years I T information security previous
to being at the Trinity I wasn't health

13
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,360
care for over five years experience and
in health care managing security teams

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,670
so I don't just come at this from a
security researcher respective I also

15
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,100
understand the industry fairly well
spent the last three years researching

16
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,280
medical devices went to handle you want
to follow me I tend to some stuff on

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:49,770
medical devices and and and Dave Kennedy
so so so why you know why research

18
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,810
medical devices why why why do they get
into it for me it was always a

19
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,579
healthcare organization was rewarding it
was you know a non-profit atmosphere it

20
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:07,990
was helping physicians and caregivers
directly back to the patients always

21
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,000
felt like I could never had a direct
impact on

22
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,049
organization's mission and values as it
relates to patient safety as I started

23
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:18,310
seeing medical devices over the years

24
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,930
network connectivity into them and
started realizing or security by design

25
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,280
in these devices that's when I noticed
you know as a security person I could

26
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,709
really have a direct impact on you know
patient safety by identifying

27
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,920
vulnerabilities in these devices you
know that our network vulnerabilities

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,569
those types of things where you at the
manufacturing with the federal

29
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,140
government

30
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,140
DHS I see a surge in really good as well

31
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,530
really work through that process have a
direct impact on patient safety in those

32
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,290
types of things so that's why I do it
you just gonna security researcher gonna

33
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,319
pick on medical device security that's
really far behind the other thing is you

34
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,010
know putting defenders inside these
organizations to give them information

35
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,769
about exposure there and provide some
recommendations on how would you go

36
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,769
about starting to fix solutions

37
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:23,040
the second thing is this is a talker
this was the FBI the FBI had typically

38
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,010
not been involved in medical device
security if you followed it just ICS as

39
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,410
well as the FDA the initial starting
points well last April the FBI actually

40
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,410
set to private industry notices that
only go to industry I'm not just showing

41
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,720
this one that ends up on Google public
domain so I can share with everybody but

42
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,919
one of the things that pointed out was
your biggest vulnerability was a

43
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,930
perception of I T healthcare
professionals at their current perimeter

44
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,090
defenses were working to states
otherwise that's a pretty big wake-up

45
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,919
call for a federal agency saying how you
see yourself with the reality is

46
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:09,449
completely wrong to like Tyler slide of
segments all the things that's not the

47
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,239
case

48
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,220
show you some of these slides positions
the public generally unaware of the

49
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,540
risks

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,450
just so you know all of this was
disclosed with you jesse has 34 years

51
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,039
old the timelines starting last year
when I did the disclosure for this stuff

52
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,440
so days a year left on his way back to
respond but outside of that everything's

53
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,500
been reported so what's the bad news I'm
gonna show you the first part of my

54
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,850
research really focused on the by
specific vulnerabilities so I spent two

55
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:55,720
years of my life and ultimately after
two years when I found out was the basic

56
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,600
security hygiene was missing in these
devices so it's been two years finding

57
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,730
out that ok they used to be hardcoded
passwords

58
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:09,920
corruption and they aren't being
outdated or patch in the second phase

59
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,880
will talk about his direct internet
facing exposure that show you today so

60
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,770
it was the bad news is that significant
risk patient safety direct medical

61
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:29,280
device exposure direct from the internet
showed in his son John Mattingly

62
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,070
actually worked with does he did some
custom searches what those on showdown

63
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,250
to get some of these data show you today
is actually not one of those custom

64
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:45,320
searches its just a publicly available
searchable showdown is a website that

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,719
goes out in like mask and scans the
entire internet and this kind of a

66
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,370
Google search for network infrastructure
for all the internet facing IP systems

67
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,770
returns banner information information
those types of things so that you can

68
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:02,479
look at specific devices and identify
them within a half hour actually under

69
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,100
an hour I located this stuff and this
external exposure than show really goes

70
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,840
to show healthcare you once we started
sharing her research with the folks over

71
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,590
at DHS tell you

72
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,299
that they even believe you know
Healthcare's ten maybe fifteen years

73
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,540
behind when it comes to security from
financial and retail sector or even

74
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,180
further behind in like industrial
controls and SCADA systems it was a good

75
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,120
news organization can also use showdown
with these data tools they're open

76
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,980
source tools to find vulnerabilities but
they need to know you have to actually

77
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,530
use the tool in order to find that and
the stuff that show you hear is actually

78
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,940
miss configuration and can really be
remediated just by shutting a service to

79
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:58,180
anyone in the showdown working with
other researchers on murder and we did

80
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,520
an hour and a half long talk that
definitely want to look up so little

81
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,010
more technical details on that last year
but we wanted to do direct internet

82
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,460
facing devices and so we're going to
show down and we're throwing some

83
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,250
keywords and I put in anesthesia to the
surgeon after I put in anesthesia gotta

84
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:28,910
hit look at it in a fairly quickly I
knew inside of it or any site inside of

85
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,060
a word or anything like that and the
only indication that was a huge medical

86
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:42,830
devices there was nothing that I knew it
wasn't a medical device and what it

87
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:48,590
actually happened there is an external
facing system that had SMB open both

88
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,810
externally facing although internal

89
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,920
anonymous read a D and gave us all this
intelligence about all this healthcare

90
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,920
organizations internal infrastructure
and other medical devices

91
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,159
this is the first health care
organization that I stumbled upon real

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
large healthcare organization which I
worked through them as well and their

93
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,539
instant response at all of that but very
large healthcare organization that over

94
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,860
12,000 employees 3,000 positions and
you'll see some of the day I show you

95
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,790
hear that very large cardiovascular
neuroscience institutions attached

96
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:26,190
elegance and almost 70,000 systems data
so this wasn't just me

97
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,910
this was their entire networks I'm
showing you medical devices I was

98
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,830
focused on research but it was
everything I mean to make a jeweler's

99
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,720
financial systems in all their medical
records of a medical record example in

100
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,870
here but it was everything we had access
to it also exposed third-party

101
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,040
connections so we see indicators in
their systems that were associated with

102
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,000
third party organizations that do
radiology reasons or for example the Jew

103
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,480
your laboratory services those types of
pics so we finally one came across it

104
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,530
was pretty big

105
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,920
well we change their showdown weary and
we we said ok is this an isolated

106
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,110
incident or is this kind of a massive
problem and so we did see the search

107
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,010
query or at least part of it up top here
how he did that showed an SMB and we

108
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:22,090
just change the origin so we did
keywords Health Clinic Hospital Medical

109
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,410
and then return the values inside of the
name so that we could identify how many

110
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,900
were affected and we came up with you'll
see here as hundreds but we change the

111
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,350
search term to specialty type things so
people in dietary pediatric urology

112
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,860
those types of things we ended up with
thousands of healthcare organizations

113
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,640
that had this configuration the result
of exposure to medical devices that will

114
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:54,800
show you some specific examples of naps
are shown in a different search terms

115
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:03,490
s your part of that is Chinese
characters 23 showdown for your help

116
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,490
coming up here at the CNN article

117
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,010
so who cares about a zombie right big
deal

118
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,319
health care physician had a zombie open
that's not a big deal when you start to

119
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,930
change these things together that it
becomes some serious exploder so here's

120
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:37,530
the screenshot of this so it is and who
knows I'm sooo 679 you this afternoon as

121
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:44,930
its stores so anyways its ability to
configure exploited so all the way back

122
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,689
in 2000 XP Service Pack 2 thats what was
on the system

123
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:59,829
well what does run over it's also over
SMB which we now know is open so why

124
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,610
does it matter that I'm gonna show you
you'll see it's really a gold mine for

125
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,800
attackers its treasure trove of
information on the system's it shows in

126
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,020
many cases office location or number

127
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,670
office number whether the you know
medical devices supporting systems

128
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,219
talking to has new system time out
exemptions those types of things

129
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:32,010
associated position names all of that
are some examples so what these

130
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,100
screenshots are so over on the far left
of all of these screenshots these are

131
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,280
scrubbed out but that's the actual work
station name on the internal network of

132
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,530
the system and then you'll see all the
information is being populated for us to

133
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:52,069
the right of that so you can see some of
these examples in the one of the left

134
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,770
this is you know systems that we found
where the screen lock was set to 0 which

135
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,589
meant the timeout wouldn't wouldn't kick
in on that system so we know that system

136
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:08,100
and we would have access so this is very
typical you know who are the operating

137
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,530
rooms that they don't say timeouts on
their cause they're all scrubbed up to

138
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,790
be fooling around says that's pretty
typical

139
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,650
there's some physical security in those
types of settings that so many others

140
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,760
there's

141
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:31,140
the other examples of medical record so
in this case the organization happen to

142
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,870
use a pic know that this isn't a vendor
problem is the healthcare organizations

143
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,280
issue there miss configuration of their
external burner but if you know anything

144
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,209
about a pic so many things to point out
here like down here at the bottom of my

145
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:49,740
chart is what you would use to connect
remotely into the epic system to view

146
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,260
all your stuff so that's their my church
service so I would know how to attack it

147
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:01,080
and I have a direct path to attack and
business objects servers using the epic

148
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,670
environment for reporting so there's
gonna be a treasure trove of patient

149
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,180
information sitting in a server was
hacker is really good information if

150
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,579
they want to go to you know financial
crime those things they can go directly

151
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,000
at the system as they know where they
sit on your network in a more

152
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,560
interesting stuff here up top

153
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,469
summarizes the CT scanner systems she
does have screen lock exemptions down

154
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,890
below a certain imagery so immature
systems there's a couple things

155
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:40,050
defibrillators and stuff to run on radio
frequency of like 400 take your field

156
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:45,150
communications systems but induction or
like the laundry systems will typically

157
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:52,000
run on two imagery so for instance the
ban on a walk out the door in the alarm

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,970
will go up to the doors are locked at
certain cardiologists here this was

159
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,570
actually the one that's highlighted in
the top there was actually a pacemaker

160
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:08,250
controllers used to program a speakers
and implantable you know anything about

161
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,720
his major controller systems you know
they do not use authorization it's a log

162
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,990
into the controller system and there's
no time off the reservation or username

163
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,890
password required in order to send
configuration to the pics so you can

164
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,449
send you can reprogram pacemakers
there's no encryption there's a good

165
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,540
reason I mean you if you put encryption

166
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,900
implantable defibrillator and they're
gonna have to have your chest cavity

167
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,630
over six months instead of every three
years to replace that you're probably

168
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:48,620
gonna die from infection before so for
Dave technicals after you so there are

169
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,570
clinical reasons why a lot of these
things are done is just as unintended

170
00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:01,460
consequences that we have it in the
bottom here these are actually this is

171
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,570
where I got the hit this is why as it
was some of the systems that were in

172
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,770
here so this bottom once as anesthesia
worker yeah that's probably not an

173
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:17,120
actual anesthesia cart this one up and
it is definitely the workstation is

174
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,260
attached to the car so if you know
anything about our environments its they

175
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,760
don't just throw extra stuff into the or
the anesthesia car has a workstation

176
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:37,740
attached directly to it so this is an
actual anesthesia cart inside of it and

177
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:45,520
in the middle there that's actually
Pediatrics new imaging system devices

178
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,880
right person only find one organization
know if found thousands will do just

179
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,910
fine in one device no we didn't so we
took her favorite data analyst analysis

180
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,020
to Microsoft Excel and we don't get all
out and that's what we came up with

181
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:10,060
68,000 systems that were affected and
then we used Excel to do control effort

182
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,819
for keyword identifiers so here's a
summary of just that one organization of

183
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,740
thousands that we found that had direct
internet exposure and the types of

184
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,230
systems associated diseases cardiology
systems like I said that huge Korea

185
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,180
logic cardiology institution attached to
this organization that was affected in

186
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,900
this example infusion pumps MRI systems
taxes annually under 600 pixels are you

187
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,260
use is healthcare environment for image
storage so I CT scanners I sure as hell

188
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:45,480
don't been a pax is where all your
images and thi sits in their undies

189
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,760
interesting we're looking at these
devices security and vulnerability

190
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:55,480
perspective is one of these devices
didn't require authentication to get

191
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:03,130
access to all the images and all your pH
I so let me clarify that when you went

192
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:10,810
in under intended use application and
retrieved an image you had to have a

193
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,730
user ID and password to login to the
pacs application to retrieve those

194
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:25,750
images you actual remote storage how all
the manufacturers we didn't start that

195
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,500
themselves and set it up

196
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,050
implemented NTFS permissions on it so
you could just walk traded to the entire

197
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,100
you known as storage and file storage
device and grab all the information in

198
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,899
some cases it did have in TFS
commissioning but what happened was

199
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:51,630
inside the application user you had to
use unique log when you actually do the

200
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:58,920
call to retrieve image and in bed it
using a hard-coded call hardcoded

201
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,320
username and password is in the service
and technician manual and documentation

202
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,770
that was easily located through Google
searches so if there's one thing I think

203
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,950
when it comes to identify those types of
things that attackers are probably using

204
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:23,130
to get a lot of information other than
you know medical record systems but 31

205
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:30,970
systems a source of attacks right or so
potential attacks that could be executed

206
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:36,039
slowly sexy yet is the physical loss

207
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:50,619
get the most sexy attack is the physical
so you know all of this information you

208
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:53,689
know he could use this he says you know
for free texting he would you know

209
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,090
specifically what floor one office
number you know what doctor its

210
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,539
associated with you can use all that
information he knows that if he gets

211
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,100
into that office he's going to sit down
it doesn't have a screensaver timeout

212
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,959
attack very easy execute you don't have
to just go around a lot of background

213
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,879
information

214
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:19,059
the other one fishing fishing this gets
interesting week announced an official

215
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:26,229
attack and get access system we can
directly so we don't have to get a

216
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:29,710
foothold and then start scanning to
start identifying medical devices were

217
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,119
to have that information so if we want
to get into the network of you want to

218
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,330
go after CT scan bility we can just go
directly to that and start performing

219
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,119
arts

220
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,129
attack this is no end user interaction
required on the system's they were XP

221
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:48,709
vulnerable persons in 2003

222
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:55,820
you know execution on these boxes will
pass through into the internal network

223
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:05,099
so you know the MSO 8067 as India's take
control of it go ahead and just pivot

224
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,779
directly internal to those systems go
right after them

225
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,139
adversary misconceptions this is
something I get a lot of crazy enough to

226
00:20:17,139 --> 00:20:21,570
do this it was interesting the
presentation yesterday was a big

227
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:29,668
health-care security and privacy of him
and the CIO Boston Children's spoke and

228
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:34,119
this is the first time that he spoke
publicly you don't know they were

229
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:39,840
attacked by anonymous 1 year ago year
and a half ago he does attack has

230
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,830
occurred higher network line and he
actually said yesterday that he was one

231
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,918
of these people

232
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:52,480
that had a misconception he thought you
know why would anybody this would never

233
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,200
happen nobody would notice us nobody
would attack a pediatric Research

234
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:10,570
Hospital you know just what will happen
but it doesn't take malicious intent so

235
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,489
there are no nation states there are
extremists there is your business types

236
00:21:15,489 --> 00:21:18,859
of things but there's also one thing
that I missed during my research and

237
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:25,239
that was you know patients themselves
this is actually a story I did look at

238
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:30,649
it through my hacker you know and 10
what can be done if someone took time to

239
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:39,649
do it but I did look at that patients a
year the patient themselves causing and

240
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:45,678
so this was two individuals that were in
Austria and they presented for treatment

241
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,159
for gunshot wounds in fragmentation
wounds and I was really pissed at the

242
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,159
article didn't explain how they got done
shopping fragmentation wounds

243
00:21:54,749 --> 00:21:57,769
didn't say is after the patients
presented their hooked up to an infusion

244
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,230
pump and a PCA which a PCA model
infusion pump is actually the basic

245
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,690
controlled administration clicker type
infusion pump and they felt their pain

246
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,239
management was under control they were
getting enough morphine well the

247
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,059
clinicians felt otherwise

248
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:17,320
so these guys they went on Google I
found service technician documentation

249
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,350
they found her footing credentials
inside the infusion pump action to the

250
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,399
infusion pump changed the upper limits
on the infusion pump and then build up a

251
00:22:25,399 --> 00:22:27,518
tolerance to morphine over the next
couple days

252
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,440
eventually having withdrawal symptoms
when they tried taking them down so it

253
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,080
was only interesting to me is telling us
to take malicious intent is something

254
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,649
that its security isn't designed to
engineering other patients see the

255
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:43,649
adverse event or alcohol

256
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:53,210
so it's more realistic attack against
health care organization probably a

257
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,440
combined attack is not necessarily just
going after health care for medical

258
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:03,120
devices you know you take something like
Boston Marathon bombing and you put that

259
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,530
at the same time as the Boston Marathon
bombing you you know knock out power

260
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,730
systems inside of Boston Children's or
or those organizations if you do that

261
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,620
that's probably the greatest threat that
we have to look at that would have the

262
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:31,590
most impact on on patient safety and
this guy he started on something called

263
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,959
cyber city and so he basically took all
this critical infrastructure and he said

264
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,640
that up with sand and you come in and
you have everything so it's like

265
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,400
railroad transportation its health care
you know it's the bank it's the power

266
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,070
utility is all of that

267
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:55,760
well one thing when I was talking to add
that he said is the health care the

268
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,770
hospital set up was the only environment
that they actually had the hardened so

269
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,400
that it wasn't too easy to get into for
the students initially so that was kind

270
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,780
of an eye opener but they're doing some
stuff there was critical infrastructures

271
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:20,200
pretty interesting so what can they do
hospitals they even start we've been

272
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,150
focused on him at all talk about this
kind of US trade official privacy no

273
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,710
patient safety but yeah you know you
shouldn't look at those types of things

274
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:34,930
later displayed but you the tools you
pen testing check your perimeter make

275
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:41,260
sure it's hard and this is an awesome so
I was in Minnesota

276
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:51,490
so this was this is definitely this case
and I getting hacked I was living in

277
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,080
Minnesota until November and then they
just moved to Los Angeles in November so

278
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,379
this is maybe a year and a half ago and
I was driving downtown double take and

279
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,530
had to go around the corner and like my
camera but this is a guy with his

280
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,950
infusion pump he had left the hospital
and so yes infusion pump news at the bar

281
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:19,280
so he is it over wifi cuz there probably
isn't wifi at the dive bar but if you

282
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,590
notice in his hand smoking and behind
his right leg there was actually a

283
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,750
bottle of alcohol so he's gonna get
hacked with smoking and drinking might

284
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:50,390
kill him before that health care to hear
something a lot of people didn't really

285
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,850
think about these threats and
manufactured certainly ten years ago

286
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:57,629
when the resigning or fifteen years ago
when they were designing these products

287
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:03,030
you know someone attacking and
potentially causing harm either

288
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,500
intentionally or unintentionally but
because a lot of Healthcare

289
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,860
Organizations got their security funding
do to help

290
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,729
well it's kind of created this checkbox
security go down here this policy

291
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:21,220
process yes yes yes yes yes very
complaints focused on security focus is

292
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,000
the new tradition of really looking at
it from patient safety instead of

293
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,820
patient privacy and something that they
need to address policy again doesn't

294
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:38,810
prevent adversarial risk so you actually
have to attack at work so I do

295
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:46,590
manufacturers well one there's they
haven't had a design for it to challenge

296
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,240
their talks about animals and those
types of things but the other is

297
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,960
development lifecycle support life cycle
if you take

298
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,299
implantable devices there was a new
technology that just came out for a

299
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:03,299
implantable defibrillator actually with
underarm so they don't have to open your

300
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:07,029
chest cavity so because of that it was
like game-changing technology right

301
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,240
expedited approval from the FDA well
expedite approval

302
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:26,139
anybody's guess how long it took from
concept actually market approval for the

303
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:34,020
closest 13 years to approval on an
expedited FDA submission and then they

304
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,039
have to be able to support that device
for many more years so that's kind of a

305
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,190
challenge is how do you support advice
for thirty years where you take the

306
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,350
approach of you know these things have a
shelf life for five years and you have

307
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,850
to completely replace them and you're
just gonna have to take that at Casa

308
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,459
Verde not so there's definitely some
challenges there are also just got

309
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:00,130
information security teams so it'll
still don't even have the most dedicated

310
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:06,110
information security staff GE Phillips
and trying to those folks do you know

311
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,350
they've been building up over the last
two years and so things that have been

312
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,750
in development for years you can't in
bed security by design if you're not at

313
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:21,610
the product features to help cure
diseases gonna get some issues I'm going

314
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,789
to a case study in the Moors researchers
wanted to touch on this is a been told

315
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,500
they can't pass you can update their
systems that's why there's a lot of

316
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:35,220
systems those your health care through
the FDA is way they've put out cyber

317
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:41,600
security plus four years since 2008
re-emphasize that in new guidance they

318
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,990
just put out in October so they can
catch it the problem is health

319
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,710
organizations typically take the answer
we can't capture device and they don't

320
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,460
go to the next step and say oh that's
not what the FBI is telling me you're

321
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,990
doing these guys can you please fix this
otherwise we didn't get a call at the

322
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,220
FDA you start saying that approach to
health care initiative is very effective

323
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,970
things start getting done all they can
say is hardcoded passwords so the reason

324
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,740
to manufacture totally passers is one
they don't want to take the time to like

325
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,250
that ability and there is clinical you
need in some aspect we gotta figure out

326
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,700
a better way of doing it but you know
the reason behind it is ok well I now

327
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,440
have the same username and password when
you call for support and I can get into

328
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,440
the system right now to fix it

329
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,870
teams who are in charge of the medical
devices typically are integrated with

330
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,709
information technology there hasn't been
great collaboration this is starting to

331
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:42,490
change that will improve things

332
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,610
historically it happens it hasn't been
there so is a second problem

333
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:52,229
well this is here

334
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:02,510
careful so can anybody at home with you
can read it this is actually a

335
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:19,250
screenshot interceptor frequency like
what may be a problem so the issues here

336
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,380
is when you're going through down at the
bottom of the season 1 there's no

337
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,010
session management to was interesting
here this is 1 screenshot explain the

338
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:36,549
other screenshots the first thing when
you went and did use wpa2 encryption

339
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:41,129
which is actually pretty good so these
are so this when I was like ok possible

340
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,460
uses WPA two

341
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:50,419
well there's hard coated roads we had
intercepted this and I couldn't grab

342
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:55,470
that WPA two key to compromise the
internal network said what if I just hit

343
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,280
say it will the application actually
check to make sure you change variables

344
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,629
and wpa2 key field or we'll just will
resubmit everything so that's what this

345
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:11,000
is everything and up here actually
wanted out what you can see the the the

346
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,750
identity

347
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,840
SSID and you can see the whe Thu
password then you take over the entire

348
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:23,389
hospitals internal network in addition
what you do is because they don't use

349
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:28,590
session management when you go in and
you grab the actual post commands I've

350
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:34,290
been able to automate and take these
types of using pumps and center post

351
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,720
command to that

352
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,770
reprogram it to switch them all over to
the rogue access point that's raged over

353
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,910
the internal network man in the middle
everything intercept drug library

354
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:49,880
updates from you so very updates are
what set the proper safe upper and lower

355
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:58,900
limits on a drug libraries bad things to
happen and managed by centralized

356
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,010
management server that pushes those drug
library so when you get the man in the

357
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,960
middle you can intercept those start
doing some bad things with them so

358
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,660
absolutely definitely a problem of
encryption they don't do things like

359
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:20,170
session ideas that would control it's
finally got a question case study this

360
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:27,000
is to provide an example of how ur or
someone that wanted to get into a

361
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,910
medical device or even security
researcher what kind of threat model and

362
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,780
look at these devices and try to find
out where is the unabomber abilities

363
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:45,110
this happen to be facing research we
found these old details that were online

364
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:53,080
and their own cellular they were on
Verizon these defibrillators are like

365
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:00,710
other manufacturers as well as a model
and external and they sit inside of the

366
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:07,830
ambulance and they have at 12:12 we've
read over cellular connectivity and

367
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,230
sends it back to a web service at the
health care organization in order to get

368
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,790
all of that 12 lead read

369
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:18,250
receiving emergency department prior to
that patient arriving so they have that

370
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,400
information at their fingertips

371
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,440
well

372
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,820
public Internet access now I can tell
you see as the x-series web interface

373
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:37,059
interface today when you go there it
says oh you need to have a certificate

374
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:42,960
right under you need to have a
certificate is the link to download the

375
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,190
Empire

376
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:53,600
so what you do is research at a threat
model as well let's go get some

377
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,529
documentation of services technician
documentation to figure out how this

378
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:08,520
thing operates well they have the sales
pitch you know with wireless and no not

379
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:17,599
really it's not but we look at that is
really big one way to do just throw

380
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,190
everything in the stack override these
types of systems

381
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,869
well it's others in the documentation
that you need to go ahead and have

382
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:35,589
remote access remote access though it
tells us that this is the specific file

383
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:41,869
that you need to change in this alter
the configuration on the device so you

384
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:47,280
have to do this well how do we do that
you go further into the school into the

385
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,040
documentation it actually explains
parameter by for a minor every single

386
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,490
default value every acceptable so how do
you switch it from pediatric to adult

387
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,348
know how do you change it to deliver
initially et jewels instead of the

388
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:09,250
default tendrils all of those pills you
detail by detail how to do it and what

389
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:14,880
those parameters are in this file so it
has an attacker would have to say okay I

390
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,020
have that information figure 2 so you
know how do I do it well you gotta get a

391
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,950
supervisor menu here's how you do it
okay great

392
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,950
you have to put it afforded a supervisor
Pasco

393
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:39,110
outside of that as an attacker you do
this trail what's the default

394
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:47,820
information please don't oh well okay
we're gonna be secure for the Pasco

395
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,820
what's a passcode go to 1234

396
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:58,890
shows you don't necessarily need and
when we do research and start looking at

397
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,170
documentation it's not until the very
flattered phases

398
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,320
specifically doing a test on specific
the wise what we're doing research

399
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,710
reading these types of things that
profile this and now we say okay we know

400
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:18,910
the exposure and we almost certainly
know our attack plan and how we can get

401
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,190
in ninety percent of time after you've
done a hands on the device you're

402
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:34,760
successful already a problem with just
one of their lines know their lines of

403
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,600
the feds and a supervisor in tech coats
is 1234 on the latest was the X series

404
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,819
is the other three models that use
external defibrillators

405
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:57,100
goes to get out and rights into all of
their systems up to the CD is that were

406
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,100
associated with those election notice

407
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:07,300
2007-2013 because part of that
supporting evidence that was supplied

408
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:12,350
was the actual service and technician
manuals that was the year that they were

409
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:17,569
produced in and so we retro over
cassini's back to the earliest knowing

410
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,820
you know publication

411
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:25,320
another one CareFusion picks us why
station that was recent was done by

412
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,040
Billy Rios and other security researcher
and this was default si credentials

413
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:40,540
override these types of systems Pyxis
supply stations really their medicine

414
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,150
cabinets sit out endorsing station

415
00:37:44,150 --> 00:38:07,900
drugs on a remote access to drugs and so
what some guidance we got this awareness

416
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,400
Stajan and how do we tackle it and the
FDA has released guidance for industry

417
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,080
and they just released not regulatory
requirements what they did release

418
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:23,650
guidance for free market solutions for
the manufacture and sell these basic

419
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,780
security hygiene items it's actually
pretty good it's not a regulatory

420
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,960
requirements for guidance so it's not
getting them there but it's definitely

421
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:45,830
progression real-estate to raise the bar
because right now I mean if someone in

422
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:57,900
their own security sucks right there are
some workshops that happens he took part

423
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,180
of it was back in November of Decius
kind of like a collaboration of industry

424
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:07,169
security researchers medical device
manufacturers as well as a function DHS

425
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:13,260
if the IRA all their building code you
can check out the building code was

426
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,560
initiative worked on with my family and
myself

427
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:22,570
George Washington cybersecurity
initiative and this was the concept of

428
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:28,990
taking her home building code approach
what can you do during engineering and

429
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,529
what you mean checkoff and inspect to
make sure that security was a better by

430
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:38,080
design and these types of products so
it's new it's not gonna be adapted in

431
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:44,569
the next two years but it's good to keep
those things moving so as we progress we

432
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,960
can hopefully get caught up we're not
going to go you know a lot of people

433
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,050
think and we solve all these problems
and you know other murders in retail and

434
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:56,130
it shouldn't just be able to get from 0
to 60 tomorrow it's not going to happen

435
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:01,710
the best we can hope for is kind of
increasing our 0 to 60 time from lessons

436
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,480
learned we don't know all the answers
right now there's those unique

437
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,900
challenges right but one thing that we
do know with we we know what does so

438
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,640
we've got to do something that we know
hasn't failed previously

439
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,930
eventually we're gonna come up with you
know better solutions for these things

440
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:30,210
and and come up in instances where wind
these devices do feel they will see that

441
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:50,690
I have my contact with her any questions
on the table but in a way back here

442
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,910
question is refining workstations are
you finding the actual embedded devices

443
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,799
is a combination of both

444
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:17,930
so integrated embedded everything's on
there and then there's there's

445
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,980
centralized still like server
architecture that pushes drug libraries

446
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,560
in those types of things to CT scanners
MRI systems how those typically work is

447
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,840
there is like the rad tech has there
were stationed enclosure can I get the

448
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,470
radiation they have some feel safe
options that are actually really good

449
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:45,270
for you go into the application you put
everything in and hit the button and use

450
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:51,290
web service security and web services
actually don't like XML files to a local

451
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:57,750
workstation is directly attached to the
CT scanner the MRI system and then

452
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,910
there's the staples easy button so even
though it's sitting out there on the

453
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:08,049
remote web server this directly talking
to you know CT scan or something like

454
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:08,630
that

455
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,190
physical control it's almost like a
campus that goes directly back into the

456
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:18,820
system and you actually at the hit that
executed so what we found is yes those

457
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:24,800
XML files you know those types of things
can be altered so does levels or like

458
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,840
values we're gonna take the image those
types of things can be altered in XML

459
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,470
files but they still have to alter it
and then get someone to actually hit

460
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,730
that button at the same time and where
the cars so realistically the biggest

461
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:46,840
threat out there was both devices and
we're getting into you know mobile and

462
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,510
digital health and so that's that's
another thing and data integrity so do

463
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:56,780
some research now on on a couple devices
just from a date didn't take any aspect

464
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,940
of we've been able to one device do
things are not supposed to you and into

465
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,390
their intended use of the dump in the
medical record so altering that data or

466
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:11,390
they're not using encryption so we can
post fake data from these devices down

467
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:11,859
into

468
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:16,069
the medical record which would probably
result in there's been a lot of research

469
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:21,329
on identity theft and presenting as you
and miss diagnosis mystery man being

470
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:25,079
prescribed drugs those types of things
so deadly combination is an entire

471
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,130
ecosystem medical devices and it can be
any one of those points that that fails

472
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:33,130
that allows you access to the actual
physical device itself

473
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:53,220
medical devices with not enough research
on it I can tell you I'm similar

474
00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:07,399
research that I'm 1234 but we don't have
enough statistics over insecure

475
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,109
abilities on these devices are very
lacking so it's really hard to get the

476
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:15,080
information so that the medical device
malfunction right now all we know is a

477
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:21,640
medical device adverse patient safety
event it goes to the FDA they try to

478
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,080
adjudicate it and they say okay is a
clinical cause of death in other medical

479
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,509
device and then we end up with this
bucket of several hundred thousand per

480
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:35,180
year of what's in a generic pocket
called medical device malfunction but we

481
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,640
don't know but you can see there was
like a cyberattack everything intended

482
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,960
or unintentional or wasn't malware those
types of things subsurface research just

483
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,589
to kind of prove out the start looking
at the intentional versus the

484
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:54,290
unintentional we do know these devices
they get configure get other now we're

485
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:58,420
because they're you know Windows XP
systems those types of things are there

486
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:06,089
you know some flavor of Linux but I
haven't specifically seen targeted now

487
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:12,820
where the FBI Community Health Systems
thing one that was really interesting so

488
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,200
most people what they recognized with
the community health system which was

489
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:21,879
four and a half million patient records
were stolen but I see was the first time

490
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,940
the FBI's actually told us that they
specifically targeting medical devices

491
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,250
in their infrastructure I was more for
intellectual property think we're also

492
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,450
seeing that with Medtronic st. Jude
Boston Children's about a year ago

493
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:38,980
their actual internal network got
breached doctor's role of stuff to get

494
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,619
intellectual property stuff and there's
a big push in China format technique is

495
00:45:43,619 --> 00:45:47,510
reporting everything and so forth and
intellectual property in order to

496
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,920
replicate that sit on imports

497
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:58,480
bigger tech stuff there are now there
are 0 day exploit kits in the wild not

498
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,460
specifically towards medical devices for
medical records a email maybe three

499
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:12,650
months ago to buy it exploits and allows
like 3000 days for medical record to

500
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:19,849
answer questions questions
