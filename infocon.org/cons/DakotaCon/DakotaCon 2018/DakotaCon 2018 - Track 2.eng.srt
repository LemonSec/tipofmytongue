1
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,530
well Kurt elasticsearch shaped a deal

2
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,830
all your each to be DNS SMB if anybody's

3
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,780
use bro before you know bro generates of

4
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,850
massive metal logs circular is kind of

5
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,100
the same thing so that tab separated its

6
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,980
JSON but you get a lot a lot of

7
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,070
information their final extraction is

8
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,520
awesome

9
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,170
so any files you see going across the

10
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,730
network like an HTTP you're gonna write

11
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,770
a role trigger for that role to download

12
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,390
the disk and you can do initial post

13
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,160
processing so if you had a rule that

14
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,110
would say I'm looking for an executable

15
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,750
of this certain size coming from this

16
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,880
location everything I want to write from

17
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,620
there download it the disk and throw it

18
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,020
in kuku to like Auto sandbox it right so

19
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,330
you can do that kind of stuff we have IP

20
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,220
reputation so if you know if you can

21
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,450
have a flat file of all these IP

22
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,739
addresses like if you're gonna an active

23
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:47,330
incident and you know where your

24
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,560
attackers are coming from or you think

25
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,610
you know where they're coming from you

26
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,360
can then apply those IPs to existing

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,860
rules so if I have a rule that just says

28
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,440
show me when there's HTTP POST you don't

29
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,790
want that to fire all over your network

30
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,100
because that would be crazy you can

31
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,170
apply IP reputation do it I'd say it has

32
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,700
to come from this address anything in

33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,150
this flap file so that helps out a lot

34
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,489
in an incident if you want to do cool

35
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,250
stuff like brute forcing brute force X

36
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,380
or all the executables that come across

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,970
your network you can use something like

38
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,709
Lua to do that

39
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,230
Louis whole programming language you can

40
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,930
export fields out of sericata into a Lua

41
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,340
scripts and you can do really whatever

42
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,180
you want with it

43
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,930
very similar to Bro scripting it's cool

44
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:30,680
that we're backed by a non-profit

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,959
because we can't be sold or bought out

46
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,030
or anything

47
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,769
Surrey cottage inerts NetFlow has really

48
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:38,660
good support for SMTP native IP six and

49
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,950
we've got a lot of cool stuff coming up

50
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,390
at 401 so today sir kind of stands at

51
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,430
404 response code joke but it's somehow

52
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,980
we skipped over 403 but so if you look

53
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,060
at the if you look at the thing you're

54
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,400
like what happened to 403 we just just

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,980
didn't do it at all

56
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,329
but our detection capabilities were

57
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,489
super extended we got way more buffers

58
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:03,680
which Jack and I were super super happy

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,950
about things like jackal jackal kind of

60
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,910
covered when he talks about writing

61
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,440
SIG's

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,000
we got a lot of TLS improvements more

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,739
buffers there which we'll talk about as

64
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:13,670
well

65
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,620
the rust stuff is really awesome helping

66
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,529
us build more secure protocol parsers

67
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,970
EVIC span did so we can have even more

68
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,490
data in there tcp stream was rewritten

69
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,520
for like they've time we can use

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,669
something called bypass so if you're

71
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:30,800
looking at SSL traffic you know after

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,180
the after the certificate appears on the

73
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,070
network everything after that sir kinda

74
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,690
can't read it doesn't care but it will

75
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,060
still try to process it unless you have

76
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,560
bypass enable bypass will be like

77
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,790
alright I saw the cert I don't care

78
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,830
about anything else so this makes it you

79
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,130
know was it like 40 some-odd percent of

80
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,770
traffic now is SSL so that's a lot of

81
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,270
traffic if you can cut that out you

82
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,580
don't have to look at it like boom I

83
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,729
just made my sensor way more performant

84
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,320
lots of bug fix and there was a pretty

85
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,139
cool CVE was tributed by A+ technologies

86
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,139
I think detection bypass that was pretty

87
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,389
cool so sorry kinda needs to see a 3-way

88
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,550
handshake occur in order for it to start

89
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,620
watching the traffic and know what it's

90
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,680
looking at and if you don't follow the

91
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,979
rules that stir kinda goes by you can

92
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:17,419
bypass and send your traffic without

93
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,310
doing that handshake and that was pretty

94
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,870
cool but that's fixed in 404 and 401 we

95
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,520
also recently released a tool called

96
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,590
circuit update so it used to be you'd

97
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,850
have to do something like pulled pork

98
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,850
oink master something like that to to

99
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,880
update your rules manage your rules so

100
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,990
they're emerging threats rules that is

101
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,660
like 35,000 rules these days so it's a

102
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,660
lot to kind of take in based on based on

103
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,280
what you need on your network you may

104
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,100
want to enable or disable rules Cercado

105
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,539
update will allow you to do that and

106
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,220
make it so that when you grab the rules

107
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,650
tomorrow all your changes will stay

108
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,500
there it's pretty well-documented

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,510
there's a read the docs I know you guys

110
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,560
can't click on this but we're gonna

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,360
tweet out a link to the slides

112
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,800
afterwards so you guys can have this as

113
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,530
a reference you can add in lots of

114
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,600
really unique rule sources if you find a

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,650
new rule source that you want to

116
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,450
automatically keep pulling down there's

117
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,080
kind of a framework for that and yeah

118
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,250
really really cool if you know Python

119
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,410
now there's a great place you can

120
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,280
contribute to if you're looking to

121
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,729
contribute to an open source project so

122
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:21,289
I've made this I made this I changed his

123
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:23,000
title last night and it was accurate

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,460
because Cercado for one beta is up right

125
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,320
now with

126
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,720
really really cool changes one of these

127
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,580
changes is a keyword in the rules called

128
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,560
starts with and ends with it used to be

129
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,290
that if you were gonna say that I know

130
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,900
my HTTP URI ends in dot PHP you would

131
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,370
have to use something called is data at

132
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,200
and it's like the word is data at all

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,760
squished together and then you had to

134
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,950
use an exclamation point to say not and

135
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,960
then one to say it's not one byte after

136
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,240
my previous content let's just make it

137
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,330
simple and say it starts with this

138
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,220
content or it ends with this content so

139
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,340
really really cool makes your rules way

140
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,680
more readable we're gonna have a we have

141
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,210
a keyword in here called be size or

142
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,450
buffer size in rules we can write and

143
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,390
we're writing TCP UDP rules we can use a

144
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,000
D size a modifier to specify how big the

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,250
data should be but now we have B for the

146
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,340
buffer so pretty awesome one of the cool

147
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,800
things that C ricotta is gonna do now is

148
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,230
called is transforms so if you're

149
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,990
dealing with JavaScript or HTML white

150
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,510
space is the enemy because you can throw

151
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,680
it all over the place doesn't really

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,570
matter the browser will still parts it

153
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,920
but if I'm trying to write rules on that

154
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,410
traffic it's super sucks because I have

155
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,030
to account for that and the way that I

156
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,410
account for all this white space when I

157
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,940
don't know where it's going to be is all

158
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,980
right these garbage pcre expressions

159
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,150
that uses up all the CP on my sensor so

160
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,430
we won't be able to do is say take a

161
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,530
chicken javascript file and compress the

162
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,970
whitespace or strip the whitespace

163
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,290
compressing it will just reduce

164
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,610
everything to one space stripping and

165
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,260
we'll just pull it all out and then you

166
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,870
write your rule based on that content

167
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,580
super super powerful like we see

168
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,950
Fisher's exploit kits they all had had

169
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,930
lots of white space to stuff so this

170
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,340
will be a way for us to normalize that

171
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,320
so now we can kind of get by it and make

172
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,200
sure our signatures will work another

173
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,230
transform is to shop 256 so you could if

174
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,370
you had a content that you kind of

175
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,130
wanted to keep secret or you didn't want

176
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,740
to give it away too easily you can use a

177
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,090
transform in your rule and instead of

178
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,070
writing ww2 google.com you could sha-256

179
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,510
that put it in your rule and then

180
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,710
someone would have to brute force it to

181
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,930
figure out what the actual content of it

182
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,909
was we have to thanks thank foxy for

183
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,460
funding development of SMB protocol in

184
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,330
sericata

185
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,049
we had SMB one

186
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:44,099
and dce/rpc basic basic protocol stuff

187
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,019
in there but now we have reimplemented

188
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,709
and rust and added in SMB to smb3 the

189
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:50,850
logs are really awesome

190
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,490
we have full of JSON logging full file

191
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,220
extraction and so you can write rules on

192
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,420
a lot of really cool buffers that are

193
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,060
present in SMB we're really excited to

194
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,519
start writing rules about that

195
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,450
so it's not like sorry Akana there's

196
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,160
some pretty good docs and I won't just

197
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,240
read the docs to you here because

198
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,589
they're on the Internet

199
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,149
you can build from source if you'd like

200
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,829
there's tons and tons and tons of

201
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,050
support for all different OSS the

202
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,940
easiest to get going is just grab the

203
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,760
OSF PPA if you're using Ubuntu pull that

204
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,920
down and in just you know sudo apt-get

205
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,829
install surakameth lots and lots of

206
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,350
walkthroughs for all sorts of different

207
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,279
weird systems that we've kind of

208
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,779
cataloged over the years or on our read

209
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,640
mine and you can even install Cercado

210
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,990
windows it works pretty well but running

211
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,209
on Linux so we have a lot of options

212
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:40,170
when you come to when it comes to

213
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,420
network cards we generally recommend the

214
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,670
Intel NICs because you just have a bit

215
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,130
more a bit more support for those if

216
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,320
you're using something like PF ring the

217
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,810
the kernels are natively developed for

218
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,510
Intel so you know the Broadcom you're

219
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,339
gonna have a bad time if you're doing

220
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,250
like over a gig per second you're

221
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,529
probably gonna need like a 10 gig Intel

222
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:02,940
card or you can go to specialized

223
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,760
hardware we recommended it Napa Tech and

224
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,930
a stand mera kaam these guys all have

225
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,140
good support for using sericata with it

226
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,490
you have to compile support for that

227
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,300
card in when you build sericata we

228
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,560
really recommend if you're using a

229
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,500
recent Linux kernel use a version

230
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,860
3 PF rings really cool and when that was

231
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,540
the best option around I used it a ton

232
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,060
but after recompiling the kernel and the

233
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,339
tools every time my kernel updated it

234
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,680
really became a drag so we have packet

235
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,170
version 3 gives you a very very similar

236
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,850
performance as to PF rank but it comes

237
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,670
without the cost of managing it and then

238
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,560
if you're doing a sniffing interface

239
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,540
turn off all the optimization settings

240
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,550
on your network card

241
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,910
I think Doug Burke says a has a page the

242
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,529
creator of security onion has a page and

243
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:53,200
I've gone to

244
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,779
approximately five thousand times and it

245
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,279
has just a big long command if you're

246
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,350
like turning off all of the all the

247
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,269
options on your network card because we

248
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,649
don't need the network card to do stuff

249
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:03,670
for us we just want to see the raw

250
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,350
packets we don't care about checksums we

251
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,970
don't care about a whole bunch of their

252
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,459
stuff just turn it all off so under a

253
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,769
gig basically anything will work like

254
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,510
you can use a Raspberry Pi to handle a

255
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,720
few hundred Meg's megabit per second of

256
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,089
traffic through it unless you have like

257
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,690
tons and tons of really terrible rules

258
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,550
like lots of pcre rules that don't have

259
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,850
good contents aren't anchored anywhere

260
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,290
if you dumped out like five hundred

261
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,930
thousand DNS rules from your missed

262
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,209
instance or your crits instance it's a

263
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,180
bad way to go don't recommend that if

264
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,230
you're somewhere where you're

265
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,149
decommissioning old hardware like keep

266
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:42,130
your eyes out just grab some of that

267
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,920
hardware it'll run circuit just fine for

268
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,440
a couple couple gigs usually my thing

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,389
was I would always keep out keep an eye

270
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:51,670
out for what servers were coming off of

271
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,649
support when I worked in the enterprise

272
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:54,490
yeah

273
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,690
because they'd be like well we don't

274
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,040
anything do with these old DB servers

275
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,860
like what are they they're like 64 cores

276
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,649
300 megabyte or 300 gigs of RAM like

277
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:03,699
we're not gonna use them like are you

278
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:04,260
crazy

279
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,730
these are amazing servers I've totally

280
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,850
taken these under tech gigs are gonna be

281
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,110
tuning you're gonna need at least 16

282
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,910
cores maybe you might need to get into

283
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,640
some accelerated capturing storage kind

284
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,870
of starts to become an issue here

285
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,610
because you'd be generating a lot a lot

286
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,110
of logs depending on how you're how

287
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,399
you're looking at your traffic and

288
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,199
bypass is gonna make a big difference

289
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:25,660
for you above that it's entirely

290
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,550
possible we know some hundred gig plus

291
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,250
implementations this is something we get

292
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,529
into into in our advanced user training

293
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,240
how to tune these up how to spec out

294
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,790
your hardware properly but you know this

295
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,350
is the this is the serious world where

296
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,760
you're going to be spending a lot of

297
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,819
money and doing a lot of optimization

298
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:44,680
there are two papers here buy one of our

299
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,470
one of our key members Peter and Mikhail

300
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,110
from Firefox

301
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,540
yeah Mozilla and these are basically

302
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,760
optimization guides of like real world

303
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,800
tuning recommendations if you have a

304
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,810
sensor and you want to tune it up these

305
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,279
are these are the two articles you have

306
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,930
to read it's called septum so the run

307
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,400
mode sturckow is

308
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,260
network security monitoring tool so you

309
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,700
can run it without any rules and they'll

310
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,810
print out lots and lots of information

311
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,150
about HP traffic it's gonna cross DNS

312
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,580
traffic TLS all sorts of stuff

313
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,940
SMB now you can run IDs mode so you

314
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,400
don't get that all that metadata you all

315
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,960
you're gonna do is fire off on rules

316
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,530
like the typical IDs intrusion

317
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,160
prevention has to be in line and sm+ IDs

318
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,020
is the most common implementation we see

319
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,610
where you're firing off on your rules

320
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,560
you're generating metadata about the

321
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,180
traffic you're seeing and really

322
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,390
creating a full picture if you worked

323
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,490
with it IDs before you've probably run

324
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,840
into this where you see this alerted

325
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,490
fire you're like Oh Trojan sounds super

326
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,160
bad but you have no context around it

327
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,870
you don't know what happened before it

328
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,830
you don't know what happened after it

329
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,900
this signature might have only hit on

330
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,730
one very small part of it

331
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,860
but when you have the full view so you

332
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,150
can see all the HP driving that occurred

333
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,770
before you can see they went to a

334
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,690
terrible porn site you can see they

335
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,110
downloaded this apk and their phone

336
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,400
count affected you can see all sorts of

337
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,050
stuff seeing the whole picture is really

338
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,430
the awesome the best way to go there's

339
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,750
one big configuration file for

340
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,920
everything in sericata

341
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,740
it's just the Cercado llamó file

342
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,670
everything is configured here and it's

343
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,670
pretty well-documented it's pretty well

344
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,690
shown what you need to do there

345
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,220
everything is you're gonna read the docs

346
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,170
you guys might be able to see that but

347
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,340
it starts off with like if you look at

348
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,690
the configuration file it's like step 1

349
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,760
tell Sura kind of what it's looking at

350
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,560
so like you have to define the network

351
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,850
that you want to protect it's called

352
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,370
your home net usually this is just the

353
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,890
you know one 92168 the 10 dot and once

354
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,130
they do that 16 dot but not you can

355
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,450
configure this for however you want so

356
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,160
whatever I'm protecting I call that my

357
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,250
home net and whatever I'm watching out

358
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,810
for and then whatever's outside of my

359
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,040
home network is gonna be my external

360
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,800
network pretty straightforward if you

361
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,660
want to configure your aim servers we

362
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,100
still have a configuration option to do

363
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,950
that rip BAM you can set up all sorts of

364
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,210
variables in there and you can use those

365
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,340
in your rules the next thing you scroll

366
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,290
down you're like what's rule sets do you

367
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,330
want to enable or disable we have lots

368
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,620
and lots of rule sets you can write your

369
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,270
own rules you can download the emerging

370
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,820
threats open rules Jack's going to get

371
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,550
into rules and just

372
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,980
second but you just uncomment these to

373
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,529
enable them and the last part is you

374
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:25,880
just select how you're gonna output this

375
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,440
so you're gonna put it out the syslog

376
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,510
are you gonna write it out so the JSON

377
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,100
file do you want to append it or do you

378
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,779
want to write a new one every day how do

379
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,490
you want to do your rollover all of

380
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,660
these kind of things are configured in

381
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,730
the amyl there's lots and lots of

382
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,160
comments so typically see ricotta is

383
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,690
still deployed on the perimeter we see

384
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,310
some companies moving towards the inside

385
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,540
because everybody's afraid to lateral

386
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,350
move in and whatnot and rightly so so we

387
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,269
see it on the host occasionally but

388
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,470
really the big thing here is if you're

389
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,360
managing lots of sensors make sure

390
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,380
you're setting your home net and

391
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,089
external net properly because if you

392
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,320
don't sell certain kind of what to look

393
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,360
out for it's not going to know how to

394
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,329
defend your network for you the rules

395
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,130
can be expensive like I said emerging

396
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,240
threat says like thirty five thousand

397
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,010
rules so really only use what you need

398
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,649
enable and disable these rule sets as

399
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:10,550
they pertain to you if you're not

400
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,339
running a web server on in this area

401
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,980
don't use the web server rules if you're

402
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,320
not looking out for word Trojans or DMZ

403
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,279
based things don't use those rule sets

404
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:27,470
and now Jekyll take over awesome so yeah

405
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,149
so so one of the things that you know

406
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:31,339
sir Kyle will generate our logs so one

407
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,230
example is what's called the fast dot

408
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:36,320
log it's a fast log it fits out exactly

409
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,579
what you need to know when your rule

410
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,290
fired but nothing really more than that

411
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,510
so you see sort of you know the source

412
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,880
IP where it was talking to you see the

413
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,310
message so like what rule actually fired

414
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,750
what am I looking at so in this case we

415
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,060
have like an IP lookup you know a

416
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,670
dynamic DNS domain and then a bunch of

417
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,589
Trojan for a church and called forum

418
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:56,779
book right so as an analyst I can look

419
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:58,790
at this and say yeah this is bad like

420
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,320
this is bad news rip that computer off

421
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,910
the wall throw it away burn in the fire

422
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,119
you know whatever but unfortunately it

423
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,349
doesn't give you anything more than this

424
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,270
so we have you know very basic

425
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,339
information but that's where even at

426
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,650
JSON comes in so this is your log that

427
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,510
contains everything this is also a log

428
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,609
that gets really really big like gigs

429
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,250
and gigs and gigs in no time because

430
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,630
it's literally grabbing everything you

431
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,300
would ever need it's basically the next

432
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,150
best thing to full pcap it's easy to

433
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,410
parse it's really easy to throw into

434
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,230
your elk Splunk instance to sort of

435
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,020
aggregate there and search through it it

436
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,429
all the information that's included in

437
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,929
fast blog as well but just everything

438
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,820
else around it so it makes the ricotta

439
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,240
more of that NSM than just ids/ips so

440
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,130
here's kind of an example of what a DNS

441
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,580
query looks like in the eve days on file

442
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,809
so it's pretty cool because I can look

443
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,910
at this and say hmm so I'm looking at a

444
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,400
DNS query I see a text record Oh what is

445
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,809
that PowerShell in the text record

446
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,480
that's probably not good right but it's

447
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,800
a really easy way to see that and be

448
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,330
like I should probably be looking into

449
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,270
this and figuring it out so let's say I

450
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,340
did see this I wrote a rule for it this

451
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,270
is kind of then what that would look

452
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,120
like when that rule fires so again we

453
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,190
have our time stamp we have a flow ID we

454
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,450
sort of just have all the information

455
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,880
including you know who who generated

456
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,850
this query where was it talking to we

457
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,860
see the signature fired we see the rule

458
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,770
message all that information and then we

459
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,510
also see the payload there so as an

460
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,730
analyst this is really useful I know

461
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,890
it's kinda hard to see but essentially

462
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,780
it's everything you would need to know

463
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,040
to understand what happened in that

464
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,070
instance this is in the example of HTTP

465
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,340
and like an HTTP request again I'm sorry

466
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,050
it's hard to see but basically we're

467
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,010
just seeing everything about that

468
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,200
transaction the protocol the destination

469
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,360
port in that request what are the

470
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,690
headers what are you know what was the

471
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,929
actual response that came back and then

472
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,429
all of the others like metadata around

473
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:55,010
you know the flow how many pcaps were or

474
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:58,309
how many packets were in that flow and

475
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,290
then if that rule did fire this is then

476
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,750
what we would be able to see again it's

477
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,130
hard to see but the point is that's a

478
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,390
lot of stuff to look at and as an

479
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,860
analyst that's great because when you're

480
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,090
trying to investigate an incident when

481
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,350
you're trying to investigate true

482
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,910
positive versus false positive activity

483
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,230
we want to know as much as we can about

484
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,300
that situation and this is where you can

485
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,780
see that but again because of how robust

486
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,270
it is it gets huge this file can get

487
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,440
really really big and it can cause

488
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,990
problems if you're not ready for that so

489
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,320
I know we talked a lot about rules oops

490
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,000
I know we talked a lot about rules but

491
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,440
let's actually talk about what is an IDs

492
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,730
rule for those that aren't really

493
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,620
familiar so consider this traffic right

494
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,840
we have an HTTP POST this is just a

495
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,820
screenshot from Wireshark this is an

496
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,160
HTTP POST and we see some pretty

497
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,500
suspicious stuff here so I want to call

498
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,960
out just you know

499
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,789
yeah the user agent super weird

500
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,580
you know detox crypto we have a you know

501
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,710
URI string of generate dot PHP we have a

502
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,860
public key in HTTP client body any

503
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,770
guesses as to what this might be

504
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,140
well what kind of malware ransomware

505
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,710
yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah so this is

506
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,450
definitely ransomware so this is a this

507
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,740
is evil and we want to write a rule for

508
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,169
it so we can do that so this is what a

509
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:10,640
rule would look like if we wanted to

510
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,440
capture this traffic now I know this

511
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,480
looks like a huge pile of garbage

512
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,740
so let's actually break this down and

513
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,650
understand what we're looking at so this

514
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,200
is the basic IDs rule format so we start

515
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,760
with an action so we're telling the

516
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
engine sort of what do we do when this

517
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,919
rule matches so when when our pattern

518
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,840
matches what do you want me to do

519
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,150
99% of the time we just say alert

520
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,880
because where we sit we can't really

521
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,679
dictate what you want to do with your

522
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,900
network but if you're in your network

523
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,400
and you say yeah I never want these

524
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,270
rules to pass or to be allowed you can

525
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,710
use something like drop so you can tell

526
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,419
the engine hey if this rule matches just

527
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:48,350
drop it

528
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,850
there's also reject and then there's

529
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,200
also passed so if it's something that we

530
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,200
don't care about let it go through but

531
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,520
again this is just telling the engine

532
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,650
hey what do I do when I see this evil

533
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,100
traffic protocol so this is what we're

534
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,809
telling the engine to what to look for

535
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:06,830
the really basic sort of for our TCP UDP

536
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,700
icmp and IP but then with sericata we

537
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,140
have a specific protocols so we have

538
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,659
HTTP dns TLS SMTP FTP a bunch more SMB

539
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:21,020
yep that just dropped today what this

540
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,400
means so what this makes it really

541
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,190
powerful is that if we tell sericata hey

542
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,770
look for HTTP traffic it's gonna look

543
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,840
for HTTP traffic on any port so if you

544
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,220
have something that's doing HTTP traffic

545
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,100
on some goofy high port sir ekkada can

546
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,159
still parse that as normal HTTP the

547
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:39,110
other idea that's out there can't really

548
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,309
do that you have to tell it what ports

549
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:43,070
to look for HTTP traffic on so if you

550
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,360
know again this trojan is doing some

551
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,520
weird stuff on an off port but it is

552
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,799
still the HTTP sort of protocol we can

553
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,120
see that and we can still write our

554
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,220
rules for that so it's really powerful

555
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,960
and we're able to really be efficient in

556
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,289
the way that we can detect this stuff so

557
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,820
after you know giving an action giving

558
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,900
it a protocol we want

559
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,240
talk about who's talking to who and how

560
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,970
so essentially this is where we indicate

561
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,040
who started the conversation and who

562
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,330
they're talking to

563
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,710
so this can be something like a single

564
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,560
IP address this can be an IP range or it

565
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,090
could be a variable so that was

566
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:14,930
something we kind of saw in the

567
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,610
screenshot of the Y amel configuration

568
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,170
you know we have like sort of our home

569
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,420
net variable which is your typical like

570
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,420
RFC 1918 internal networks and then

571
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,220
external net which is basically not

572
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,770
what's in your home net so if we wanted

573
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,290
to say you know person and accountings

574
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,390
computer talking to evil website in

575
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,710
Russia we would say it's our home net

576
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,950
talking to the external net right and

577
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,170
then sort of following that then it

578
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,820
would be the ports so we would basically

579
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,440
be able to say what port is this traffic

580
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,170
occurring on again if we're using a

581
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,850
protocol specific so if we're saying

582
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,700
HTTP we would just put any for both

583
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,370
ports we would put any on sort of the

584
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,010
home net port because you know it's a

585
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,840
randomly assigned port but then we can

586
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,670
put any for the external port because it

587
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,500
could be 80 it could be 80 80 it could

588
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,560
be 8 4 4 3 it could be you know 30,000 I

589
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,190
don't know so we can just put any there

590
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,370
which is really powerful so following

591
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,560
that so as we saw in our logs what do we

592
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,510
want it to say when this alert fires as

593
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,580
an analyst what do we want to know you

594
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,480
can put anything here

595
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,330
it's just a freeform text field but it's

596
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,070
useful to be as detail as possible again

597
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,350
if you're an analyst and your rule fires

598
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,370
you want to know what happened you don't

599
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,780
want it to just say something really

600
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,870
generic like trojan like okay what like

601
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,360
what kind of trojan what exactly was it

602
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,160
do we have a name for this trojan do we

603
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,170
have an architecture for it is it net is

604
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,810
it win 64 is it Linux is a Mac you know

605
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,880
whatever basically just be as detailed

606
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,440
as possible help yourself out help your

607
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,200
team out and consistency is key so if

608
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,520
you're starting to like write messages

609
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,470
find sort of a format that works for

610
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,030
your team and stick with it but that's

611
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,140
where you would just put that you just

612
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,710
declare it with the message keyword so

613
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,360
following that we serve getting to the

614
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,770
content so there's the actual meat of

615
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,970
the rule like what are we actually

616
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,770
trying to look for in the packet we've

617
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,450
sort of said all the foundational

618
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,310
aspects up but now we're actually going

619
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,080
to look for what's in that HTTP traffic

620
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,050
that we care about or whatever protocol

621
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,880
this is the building blocks so this is

622
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,020
the actual bytes so we're trying to

623
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,710
detect

624
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,179
this is where we want to be unique we

625
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:15,830
want to be specific but we also want to

626
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,230
be you know sort of loose in the sense

627
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,520
that maybe we want to catch some

628
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,309
variants so really just want to try and

629
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,980
find it's kind of a continuum of not

630
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,480
being so specific that if someone just

631
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,250
changes one little thing you're gonna

632
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,770
miss and be false negative being but you

633
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,970
also want to be specific enough that

634
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,080
you're not gonna false positive on

635
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,419
everything these contents can be

636
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:38,000
representative ascii hex or a

637
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,049
combination of both and then following

638
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:43,669
your contents there we just have some

639
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:45,320
rule metadata so essentially just some

640
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,029
good housekeeping stuff so a signature

641
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,940
ID it's a unique ID for that rule so

642
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,830
it's a really easy way to identify the

643
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,899
differences in the rules there you know

644
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:55,070
so that we don't have duplicates things

645
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,169
like that you can include a revision

646
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,730
number so when you initially write you

647
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,049
really can give it a revision number of

648
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,549
one and then if you were to make any

649
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:03,110
changes to it you know I'd suggest

650
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,669
bumping that revision number up just so

651
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,890
that way you sort of are all on the same

652
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,080
page of what's happening with that rule

653
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,330
did anything happen to it you know is it

654
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,919
a false positive and you had to add some

655
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:14,809
stuff whatever and then you can give it

656
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:16,190
other things too like a class type you

657
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,520
can add references things like hashes or

658
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,779
URLs like if there was a blog post that

659
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:22,610
you know you wrote a rule from you can

660
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,679
stick it in there again this is really

661
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,740
useful for if your rule fires and you

662
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,149
know you're trying to figure out wait

663
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:30,620
what was that rule about why did I write

664
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,120
that and you can say oh cool it was from

665
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,860
this blog or it was from this hash and I

666
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,360
can go on virustotal and say oh yeah

667
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,370
that was this thing so it's more just

668
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,679
helping yourself out but that's the

669
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:47,299
basic format of an IDs rule the the

670
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:49,700
revision number of the signature is

671
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,039
super important to us as someone who

672
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:53,809
provides a lot of rules out sometimes

673
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:55,220
we'll get a false positive report and

674
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,200
they'll be like yeah this rule it's just

675
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,760
kind of generating all these alerts and

676
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,409
you guys should probably go fix it and

677
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:02,029
we look at it we're like what revision

678
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,830
of the rule are you on might be like our

679
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,720
our rule says their vision for we're

680
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,270
like we're actually on revision 36 of

681
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,460
that rule so you might have a problem

682
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,110
make sure you're getting the latest

683
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,630
rules and then get back to us when you

684
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,690
get that new rule set yeah definitely

685
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,250
super important we have some rules that

686
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,100
are based around like like we tracked or

687
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,440
all the different tour IPs and stick

688
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,450
those into rules and

689
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,160
that's obviously updated a lot and so

690
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,540
like if someone's a couple days behind

691
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,910
then there's a whole new slew of IPs and

692
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,250
so they're like wait we're missing all

693
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,750
this stuff's like what revision are you

694
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,190
on like but yeah cool so again so now

695
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,420
that we've kind of covered that basic

696
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,650
IDs rule format let's look at that

697
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,050
traffic one more time and now let's

698
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,760
start picking out some things so we see

699
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,320
a post method right that would be a good

700
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,840
content to choose you know HTTP post is

701
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,610
important here we have a pretty

702
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,340
interesting URI string generate PHP if

703
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,360
we're looking at what we think is a

704
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,310
ransomware that's probably indicative of

705
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,620
some some naughty behavior really

706
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,950
interesting user agent string and you

707
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,960
know we have this public key sort of

708
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,230
variable down an HTTP client body you

709
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,760
know that hostname is pretty interesting

710
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,170
but why don't we want to really include

711
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,790
that in a rule it can change yeah some

712
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,200
of the easiest things to change so we

713
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,220
definitely don't want to include those

714
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,450
things we want to include the things

715
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,760
that we think are unique to this sort of

716
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,380
traffic but aren't gonna change this

717
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,800
frequently so if I'm going to express

718
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,210
that in an idea Struhl it would kind of

719
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:29,740
be set up like this you just say content

720
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,090
and then you stick your content in there

721
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:34,270
pretty straightforward now we can kind

722
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,710
of take this one step further with what

723
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,330
we talked about with the protocol

724
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,390
specific keyword so we have these

725
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,570
different buffers right so okay so if we

726
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,460
wanted to set this up in an actual rule

727
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,930
sort of format from start to finish we

728
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,050
would say alert protocol HTTP we have

729
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,640
our home net talking to an external net

730
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,350
so we have an internal client talking to

731
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,270
the Internet you know in fact you're

732
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,280
like letting them know hey I'm infected

733
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,980
with this ransom or whatever and then we

734
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,780
just sort of list out our contents there

735
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,980
they don't have to be in any specific

736
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,290
order in this case but that's kind of

737
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,250
how that would work and then we just

738
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,910
have our metadata there at the end so

739
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,220
for HTTP specific which we write a ton

740
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,410
of rules for we have a lot of different

741
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,030
what are called buffers so essentially

742
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,710
when you look at that HTTP traffic every

743
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,540
single part of that is sort of ripped

744
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,220
out and put into a little bucket so that

745
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,250
HTTP method is just that you know post

746
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,220
get head whatever and they're just put

747
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,360
in these little buckets and we can just

748
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,650
match in that little bucket instead of

749
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,600
trying to match in the entire packet so

750
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,420
it makes it really really efficient

751
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,560
essentially what this does is it makes

752
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,110
our rules super efficient which helps

753
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,820
the sensor out so the more efficient our

754
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,679
rules are the less problems we're gonna

755
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,360
have with our sensor as we inspect more

756
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,570
and more traffic so if we assign these

757
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,250
buffers to the contents that we just

758
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,299
picked out this is kind of what that

759
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,799
would look like so we have a content of

760
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,390
post and that's in the HTTP method

761
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,240
buffer so sir god is only looking right

762
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,030
here for post you know it's not looking

763
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,530
down here it's not looking in any of the

764
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,000
other header fields it's only looking

765
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,570
right there

766
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,630
so again super super specific and really

767
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,700
efficient again kind of continuing down

768
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,890
we have the HTTP URI buffer so it's only

769
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,390
gonna be looking in the URI string so

770
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,160
after the the method and then before the

771
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,970
HTTP version the HTTP user agent so

772
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,280
we're only inspecting this field right

773
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,520
here

774
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,470
we're not even inspecting the actual

775
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,970
header name so we're just inspecting

776
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,970
what comes after it whoops and then

777
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,860
public key equals which is down here in

778
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,480
our HTTP client body so that's what's

779
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,540
being posted to that server so again

780
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,150
very efficient that's kind of the key

781
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,910
here so then if we rebuild our rule with

782
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,620
the buffers intact that's then what that

783
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,809
looks like so that's the same kind of

784
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:41,010
rule that we just looked at you know

785
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,990
before we dug into that but we've just

786
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,840
sort of built it out it makes sense of

787
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,540
anyone have any questions yes

788
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,420
yep yeah good question so he's basically

789
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,460
saying you know are these matching

790
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,530
individually or all together these are

791
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,410
all like basically and together so it's

792
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,030
like boolean logic and it's all and so

793
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,920
we're looking for a content of post as

794
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,530
the method and generate PHP in the URI

795
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,570
string and that user agent and that

796
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,460
value in the client body sure yep

797
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,300
exactly

798
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,400
yeah so if they changes a yeah your

799
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,170
agent your user agent or something our

800
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,420
Burroughs but um you know that's kind of

801
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,000
a cat-and-mouse game we play but yeah

802
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,870
yeah good question yeah one of the

803
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,400
things we'll do is sometimes if we have

804
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,260
a malware like this where they're being

805
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,000
just really kind of cheeky and they're

806
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,050
putting the name of the Mauer in the

807
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,240
user agent sometimes it'll write three

808
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,860
or four rules for the same activity

809
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,840
because we figured they're gonna change

810
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,460
it once they start noticing that they're

811
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,060
being super dumb so maybe we don't use

812
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,340
to generate PHP for the URI we have one

813
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,190
rule that does the just the user agent

814
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,560
another rule looking for the generate

815
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,320
PHP and the public key you know we're

816
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,490
right a couple rules so that we have

817
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,340
some some backup rules and in case this

818
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,660
starts firing this is that okay point it

819
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,270
that is data at thing that I talked

820
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,830
about that's that looks like weird

821
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,180
so this basically says that this there's

822
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,610
no data after the dot PHP in HP or I

823
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,430
buffer this is replaced by ends with

824
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,930
that's one of the new things we have

825
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,520
them for one so that's going to make

826
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,150
this a little bit more readable yeah

827
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,750
absolutely

828
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,950
and that's one of the cool things about

829
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,300
oh sorry question

830
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,910
so one thing if I understood correctly I

831
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:54,930
mean one thing we could do is in the

832
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,730
gate certain user agents so we could say

833
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:59,670
like you know we could say content bang

834
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,620
Mozilla right and then that would

835
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,810
basically tell the engine to not inspect

836
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,570
any packets containing a user agent with

837
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:09,510
Mozilla and then wild carding no but we

838
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,360
have pcre so you could put a regex in

839
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,490
your rule the only downside with regex

840
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,560
is it's really inefficient so it's going

841
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,490
to make the engine work really really

842
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,170
hard especially if it's like a loose

843
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,390
regex or kind of super strong other

844
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,240
content matches but um yeah so you could

845
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:32,070
wild-card in that capacity cool sweet so

846
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,110
you know as we go on and through this

847
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,670
project we continue to add more and more

848
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,890
keywords again the name of the game is

849
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,180
efficiency and one of the cool things

850
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,040
about Cercado being open sources we can

851
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,840
basically work with victor and the rest

852
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,310
of the team and just say hey it'd be

853
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,860
really cool if we could do this and

854
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,170
they're like yeah sounds good and then

855
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,580
like next week there's a pull request

856
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,740
for it so it's really really fun to have

857
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,150
that like immediate feedback loop and

858
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,190
make it a lot easier for us as analysts

859
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,140
to write rules so one example of that is

860
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,790
something called header HTTP header

861
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,100
names so what that does is it basically

862
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,680
parses out all the header names and puts

863
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,190
them into a string separated by hex 0 DD

864
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,280
X 0 so I get a new lion carriage return

865
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,110
so it's really useful for tracking the

866
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,910
order of headers as well as the presence

867
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,770
of certain headers so like back in the

868
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,600
day we would have to write a regex to

869
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,000
basically say okay at the beginning of

870
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,070
the headers it's gonna be the host

871
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,590
header name and then user agent you know

872
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,810
and basically go from start to finish in

873
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,490
that order but it was a regex and it was

874
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,560
really inefficient I mean does anyone

875
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:38,340
really like writing reg X's no it's

876
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,090
awful surprise are not insane yet for

877
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,620
how many pieces we have to write but um

878
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,060
no but this is really cool so then it

879
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,800
parses it out now it's just a string so

880
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,540
not only is it easier to just sort of

881
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,040
put together and a rule but it's also a

882
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,100
lot like more efficient we're not doing

883
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,610
p-series

884
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,430
and that's that's the name of the game

885
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,870
so what's cool so it's pretty neat some

886
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,340
of the features that that we have in in

887
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,990
store these are some of the other ones

888
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,200
that came out recently at the Florida

889
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,260
that one sort of release and then it's

890
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,250
just kind of adding to that so

891
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,840
essentially we're just ripping out more

892
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,710
and more headers and allowing us to

893
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,300
match on those more specifically cool

894
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,710
so that was HTTP but let's talk about

895
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,139
DNS so DNS can be really important we

896
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,850
don't like to rely on DNS kind of rules

897
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,679
just because you know they're kind of

898
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,480
like fire-and-forget and then you have

899
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,460
like a domain that's been killed and now

900
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,050
it's in your rule set and it's just kind

901
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,668
of wasting cycles but they can be really

902
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:33,080
useful if like let's say there's an a

903
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,699
report that comes out about some apt

904
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,679
they didn't give you any samples but

905
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,449
maybe they gave you the domain names you

906
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:39,560
can just write a bunch of rules that at

907
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,629
least can alert you to say like someone

908
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:43,760
tried to talk to this domain we should

909
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,199
probably you know throw their computer

910
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,770
in the trash so instead of just relying

911
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,110
on the UDP protocol we have a DNS

912
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,629
protocol keyword that we can use so this

913
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:56,389
does both UDP and TCP based DNS queries

914
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,570
and again it's port agnostic so we don't

915
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,070
have to say only look for traffic going

916
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,020
to port 53 we can say look for traffic

917
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,810
on any port and that's really powerful

918
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,400
because again it just allows for

919
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,370
flexibility and efficiency and then we

920
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,020
also have what's that called the DNS

921
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,080
query keyword so essentially this is

922
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,850
just ripping out whatever domain exists

923
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,190
in that request and that's what we're

924
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,410
looking for so it's really easy so this

925
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,790
is kind of what your standard DNS query

926
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,550
looks like in Wireshark so we have like

927
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,080
a bunch of flags here that just explains

928
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,520
sort of how that request is being made

929
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,200
and then we have the actual thing we

930
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,640
care about here which is that you know

931
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,280
the domain we're looking for so start it

932
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,390
back in the day we had to write rules

933
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,030
like this we're using alert UDP we're

934
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,450
talking on port 53 our contents included

935
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,310
a bunch of those flags so I call this

936
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,800
hex we're doing positional modifiers

937
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,240
saying those flags need to be in a

938
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,920
certain spot because that's what we know

939
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,960
about the DNS protocol and then here's

940
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,270
the actual domain you know again those

941
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,610
aren't periods but they're actual you

942
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,320
know it's it's showing the length of the

943
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,590
different parts of that domain really

944
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,940
frustrating really kind of annoying

945
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,320
right it doesn't make a ton of sense

946
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,760
wouldn't it just be easier to write the

947
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,100
domain name there well yeah so that's

948
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,360
kind of what we get so this is how we

949
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,550
can do it now we can say alert DNS and

950
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,130
then we can just say basically at any

951
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,920
ports because we can parse any ports we

952
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,130
just

953
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,290
this one this one keyword DNS query and

954
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,460
then we give it the domain name we're

955
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,330
looking for and that's it so it's a lot

956
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:24,920
more efficient and it's also a lot

957
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,540
easier as an analyst right these rules

958
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,100
this is also something I could really

959
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:36,260
easily be automated in that case just

960
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,970
say if you look at this rule in the end

961
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,410
the ports and one night we have home net

962
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,890
on any port to anything on any port any

963
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,500
ideas why we wouldn't use external net

964
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,830
there for a DNS rule exactly yeah cuz a

965
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,910
lot of a lot of enterprise a lot of

966
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,680
places have internal DNS queries that

967
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,390
will resolve things internally so we

968
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,610
don't want to miss out on that we want

969
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,140
to make sure that our rule fires on it

970
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:04,460
in all cases awesome and another reason

971
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,320
just going back one more slide well I am

972
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,380
this way kind of stinks is it also opens

973
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,400
up the door to a lot of false negatives

974
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,000
it turns out not all DNS resolvers are

975
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,720
following the RFC and so sometimes these

976
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,400
flags won't all be there they'll be in a

977
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,810
different order or something and it

978
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,540
causes problems it makes us sad but if

979
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:26,900
we use the DNS keyword we're all good so

980
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,530
it's pretty neat

981
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,880
again we're just trying to make things

982
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,010
faster and better for everyone in this

983
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,320
case your sensor will be happy and your

984
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,990
analysts will be happy so let's also

985
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,060
talk about TLS in that same sort of

986
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,390
situation so TLS is kind of tough it's a

987
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:43,070
blind spot for pretty much any sort of

988
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,210
network traffic unless you're doing

989
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,250
man-in-the-middle which is awesome if

990
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,000
you are what you know until TLS 1.3 is

991
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,830
like fully enabled we can see quite a

992
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,540
bit of stuff including things like

993
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,460
certificate information all that kind of

994
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,740
stuff we kind of have this like ongoing

995
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,290
feud with let's encrypt you know I think

996
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,480
it's really cool I like encryption but I

997
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,340
also don't like giving away free

998
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,470
certificates that can't be revoked or

999
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,660
taken down if they're being abusive like

1000
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,600
malware or phishing or any other evil

1001
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,960
stuff but anyway we can do stuff with

1002
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,910
SSL and TLS we can write rules for it we

1003
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,190
can actually still do something on the

1004
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,650
network with it so this is sort of what

1005
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,660
your standard you know certificate

1006
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,430
exchange looks like in Wireshark coming

1007
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,840
across the wire so we have

1008
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,480
here basically from the external server

1009
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,580
passing down the server - or the

1010
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,220
certificate to us and then this is sort

1011
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,420
of what that looks like broken out in

1012
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,430
Wireshark so we have a serial number and

1013
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,440
we have sort of the subject or part of

1014
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,180
the subject this is really what we want

1015
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,620
to focus on when we're looking at these

1016
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,280
requests and when we're looking at rules

1017
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,260
so a TLS protocol it's like DNS it's

1018
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,410
like HTTP its port agnostic so if

1019
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,480
there's some sort of weird activity on a

1020
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,760
random port we can still detect it if we

1021
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,550
use the TLS protocol keyword again super

1022
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,870
powerful you could just write a generic

1023
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,750
rule you know looking for like TLS

1024
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,310
activity that's not on port 443 and

1025
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,410
that's probably strange why is there

1026
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,420
certificate being exchanged and a weird

1027
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,970
port things like that but there's also a

1028
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,080
lot of keywords that we can work with

1029
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,570
you know and we can basically parse out

1030
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,460
that entire certificate rip everything

1031
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,110
into a little bucket and just look there

1032
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,240
when we build our rules out so the most

1033
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,740
important thing or one of the more

1034
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,060
important ones that we use is called TLS

1035
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,160
subject so anything in the subject of

1036
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
that certificate we can write a rule for

1037
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,840
same goes for the cert serial so if

1038
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,610
there's a specific serial number we want

1039
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,830
to track or detect on we can just

1040
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,630
basically rip that serial number out and

1041
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,880
use it in a rule and then on the other

1042
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,010
side of it on the outbound requests in

1043
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,710
the sni we can also grab the domain name

1044
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,710
there and basically detect the request

1045
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,600
for a certificate from a server this can

1046
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,090
be useful if the actual external server

1047
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,280
is down and we just want to detect that

1048
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,050
your you know machine was trying to

1049
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:58,700
connect to it similar to like a DNS rule

1050
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,870
so this is the old way this is kind of

1051
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,000
how we had to write rules back in the

1052
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,430
day we still had the TLS keyword but we

1053
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,500
didn't have the buffers so we were able

1054
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,770
to still parse out TLS on any port there

1055
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,290
but we had to use the hex the raw hex

1056
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,820
bytes sort of sort of reminiscent of

1057
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,380
what we were looking at in the DNS side

1058
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,270
of it you know so here we have this is

1059
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,540
the certificate serial number and then

1060
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,200
we have this 5504 oay and hex

1061
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,830
essentially that is the oh you there the

1062
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,870
organization part of the certificate

1063
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,150
subject and we're doing again these

1064
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,650
positional modifiers we're trying to

1065
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,120
tell the engine hey look for this here

1066
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,350
look for this there because when we

1067
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,060
break out the shift certificate we know

1068
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,960
these things are in these specific

1069
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,020
locations

1070
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,270
but again kind of a headache who wants

1071
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,540
to do math math is boring right so with

1072
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,390
that this is the new way so we're still

1073
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,800
using the tos protocol

1074
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,420
we're still looking on any ports because

1075
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,370
we're using that protocol but then what

1076
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,290
we're able to do is use the TLS search

1077
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,330
serial keyword and then just give it the

1078
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,400
certificates serial number really

1079
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,530
straightforward really easy you know

1080
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,000
it's it is in hex that's just how the

1081
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,010
certificate serial numbers work but um

1082
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,700
it's just a little bit more thought-out

1083
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,750
similarly we have them the TLS search

1084
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,700
subject keyword and then instead of

1085
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,470
doing that hex and the positional

1086
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,090
modifiers we can just say hey the

1087
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,560
organization equals default Company Ltd

1088
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,470
really straightforward really simple and

1089
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,810
just a little bit less of a headache so

1090
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,610
again it's more efficient and it's just

1091
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,890
a lot easier as a rule writer to take

1092
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,450
care of business when we're trying to

1093
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,830
write rules to detect this stuff so when

1094
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,720
we talk about rule sets we mentioned our

1095
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,950
rule said the emerging threats rule said

1096
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,680
a couple times we have an open rule set

1097
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,510
so this is free anyone can use it

1098
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,720
I think it falls under the same license

1099
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,500
as sericata

1100
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,120
but um yeah essentially anyone can go to

1101
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,390
this URL hit it download the rules mess

1102
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,410
with in your network do whatever you

1103
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,520
want with it

1104
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,610
and then we also have a pro rule set so

1105
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,410
it's basically a paid rule set you have

1106
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:01,480
to pay for it it's essentially the same

1107
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,160
thing as the open rule set but just a

1108
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,290
lot more rules are a part of it kind of

1109
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:07,090
the difference there is when we write

1110
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,620
rules that we think are gonna have a

1111
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,210
large impact on the community as a whole

1112
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,740
so whenever there's like maybe an

1113
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,290
internet wide incident you know things

1114
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,240
like wanna cry that kind of stuff and we

1115
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,830
have coverage for that stuff we push it

1116
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,180
to the open rule set so anyone can have

1117
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,490
access to it if people in the community

1118
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,230
contribute rules to us so like if you're

1119
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,670
an analyst at your organization you find

1120
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,200
some cool malware there's not a rule

1121
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,400
written for it you write one and you

1122
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,990
send it to us we'll push it back out to

1123
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,370
the community and well thank you and say

1124
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:32,020
that's awesome

1125
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,360
but then the pro the pro rule set is

1126
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,250
more like what we do day to day so we're

1127
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,480
the ones finding the samples we're the

1128
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,040
ones reversing them we're putting in a

1129
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,200
bunch of work there so that it's a

1130
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,340
little bit more expansive it has a

1131
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,380
little bit more coverage but that one

1132
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,900
cost money it's not a ton of money but

1133
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,690
it's per sensor so it can get expensive

1134
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,990
similarly talos cisco those guys are the

1135
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,760
other main sort of rule set for

1136
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,859
they don't write rules for sericata but

1137
00:42:56,859 --> 00:42:58,630
their rules will work in sericata just

1138
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,079
not as well yeah and then they also have

1139
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,910
a community rule set that operates on

1140
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:05,319
sort of a different sort of schedule

1141
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:07,029
basically as their rules get older they

1142
00:43:07,029 --> 00:43:09,490
become free and then they also have a

1143
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,440
paid rule set as well and at the bottom

1144
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,700
there's some companies that do offer

1145
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,619
service Cercado specific rule sets

1146
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:16,599
attack detection it's like a Russian

1147
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,880
organization that writes rules around

1148
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,559
their github they do a lot of like CBE

1149
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:22,569
vulnerability research stuff which is

1150
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,220
cool but then CrowdStrike and

1151
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,869
SecureWorks also do Cercado specific

1152
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,730
rule sets but I think they both cost

1153
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,670
money they don't do any free stuff but

1154
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,170
Tom you know just ways to get some

1155
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,529
sericata specific rules so there are

1156
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,150
some cool NSM projects that do use

1157
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,529
sericata so these are kind of like

1158
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,450
all-in-one solutions that you know sort

1159
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,520
of you know come pre-configured sort of

1160
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,200
on a VM and you can just drop them in

1161
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,549
and play with them

1162
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:48,039
so silks is a really cool one a couple

1163
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,990
of guys we work with sort of manage this

1164
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,730
project it's Cercado with elasticsearch

1165
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,069
log stash cabana and then serious which

1166
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:58,210
is like a rule manager so it's pretty

1167
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,250
cool into play with security onion I'm

1168
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,299
sure a lot of people here have heard of

1169
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:04,750
this one this includes Cercado as well

1170
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,880
as a bunch of other different network

1171
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,119
security monitoring tools bro cetera

1172
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,740
rockin sm is one I'm not super familiar

1173
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,240
with this one but it does include

1174
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:19,299
sericata which is pretty cool so cool so

1175
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:21,760
community wise again we're open source

1176
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,859
we're very into the community we're into

1177
00:44:23,859 --> 00:44:25,270
the idea of giving back we want to

1178
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,579
basically engage the community and have

1179
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:29,799
the community engage us with this we're

1180
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:31,000
kind of in it together so we have a

1181
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,160
couple different ways to contribute on

1182
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,630
the emerging threat side of the house if

1183
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,490
you're writing rules if you're dealing

1184
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,079
with our rules and we're causing

1185
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,569
problems this is one way to hit us up we

1186
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:42,910
have a mail list it's open anyone can

1187
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,980
just join it and we just do signature

1188
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,319
discussion there if you're dealing with

1189
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:48,520
circa kind of stuff in general if you

1190
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,750
have questions if you have problems

1191
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,910
deploying setting it up compiling it

1192
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,460
dealing with rules whatever we also have

1193
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,279
the OSF Cercado mailing list so the OSF

1194
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:59,650
users mailing list again that's open

1195
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,569
feel free to jump on that interact with

1196
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:04,329
us they're on Twitter these are all the

1197
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:07,760
different twitter handles for the OSF

1198
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,500
Cercado specific and emerging threats

1199
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,830
specific and then IRC if anyone's in IRC

1200
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:17,770
still we're hashtags are got on freenode

1201
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,710
we gonna ask if we have a slack no we

1202
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,810
don't it looks like we're gonna save me

1203
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,560
the trouble of trying another slack room

1204
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,460
one of the things I thought was really

1205
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,260
cool in Zurich on in Prague on our

1206
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,130
yearly kind of conference we there was

1207
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,320
like a four hour a two-day four hours

1208
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,140
section where everyone there could go

1209
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,150
and see what the roadmap is for sericata

1210
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,740
I could see what features everyone's

1211
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,780
working on you can raise your hand and

1212
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,880
say it would be really cool if we did

1213
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,619
this but a little differently and like

1214
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:50,359
it was those four hours of really

1215
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:52,310
awesome discussion with people that just

1216
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,630
used sericata and I thought that was

1217
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,750
great really just sericata is a huge

1218
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,150
community and everyone is really open so

1219
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,820
if you have questions if you have ideas

1220
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,500
by all means put them out there you know

1221
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,450
it's pretty unlikely that you'll get

1222
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:07,790
flamed for anything we're all pretty

1223
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,090
pretty nice guys I can't say the same

1224
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:17,930
for Jack but but ya know seriously I

1225
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,180
mean we're you know as much a part of

1226
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,859
this as you guys are and we just want to

1227
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:23,180
make everything better so if you have

1228
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,830
suggestions ways to make it better let

1229
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:27,890
us know so just some upcoming events if

1230
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,540
any of this stuff was cool to you or

1231
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,790
resonated with you we have sri khan

1232
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:33,200
which is our annual sericata

1233
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,150
user convention it's in vancouver this

1234
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,700
year which is pretty cool it's just a

1235
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,800
two-day conference it's pretty small I'd

1236
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,140
say it's you know similar size to I

1237
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,080
guess this this kind of crowd but it's

1238
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,369
really cool if you're using sir kata if

1239
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:47,750
you're an analyst using it whatever it's

1240
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:48,830
a really great way to interact with

1241
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:50,240
other people there interact with the

1242
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,580
developers and you know yell at them and

1243
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,859
say hey make it better that's a great

1244
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:56,960
way to do that we're gonna be doing a

1245
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,100
two day training there on how to write

1246
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,380
good rules similar to the one that we're

1247
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,970
giving this weekend if that was

1248
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,520
interesting for anyone the developer

1249
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,900
training is a thing kind of talked about

1250
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,880
that and private training so if you guys

1251
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,710
are using Cercado a lot that's one thing

1252
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,060
that we can do is come on-site and help

1253
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,070
out and make everything better from that

1254
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:15,200
perspective feel free to reach out

1255
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,920
that's all on the website there alright

1256
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,660
and that's about that any question

1257
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,868
all right

1258
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,509
yeah so the question is when you have an

1259
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:47,160
eternal resolver and the DNS request

1260
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,170
appears to come from the resolver how do

1261
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,309
you go about finding the person that

1262
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:52,049
actually originated that request I've

1263
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,700
had to do this a bunch times and really

1264
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,559
it you want to have good logging on your

1265
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:57,509
resolver to see who actually made the

1266
00:47:57,509 --> 00:47:59,069
request there's nothing in serie cada

1267
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:01,079
that's gonna find that for you or tell

1268
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,660
you that that's really and I've had I've

1269
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,920
had situations in networks where there

1270
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,390
have been like three different resolvers

1271
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,829
that it's went through it takes a whole

1272
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:09,839
afternoon man it sucks but that's kind

1273
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:10,769
of the way you gotta you got to go by

1274
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:14,629
the locks on the on the DNS resolver

1275
00:48:17,029 --> 00:48:26,519
could be it could be yeah yeah good

1276
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:29,328
question yeah

1277
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,620
so the question is how active is our

1278
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,560
github it's it's very very active if you

1279
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,090
want to contribute code there is there

1280
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,820
is a code guideline and whatnot all of

1281
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,650
the are read mine our ticket system is

1282
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,030
open so you can see all the things that

1283
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,440
we're working on if you wanted to

1284
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,660
volunteer to contribute something you

1285
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,480
can do that we're really just open if

1286
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,830
you had questions about it particular

1287
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,600
things like what could I work on now we

1288
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,010
have lots of ideas depending on your

1289
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,210
experience level you know if you write a

1290
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,890
lot of Python there's stuff you could do

1291
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,630
and certain kind of update if you're

1292
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,300
gonna see your rusts we are looking for

1293
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,890
people to do that and we are hiring too

1294
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,420
so if you wanted to do part-time

1295
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,560
full-time remote coding for sericata

1296
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,430
we do have the ability to pay people and

1297
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,700
whatnot so

1298
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,599
[Music]

1299
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,840
yeah absolutely the question is like how

1300
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,520
easy is it to pull down sericata to mess

1301
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,980
with it in the lab super easy just grab

1302
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,930
it we have pre-built binary packages for

1303
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,580
all the common Alissa's that are out

1304
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,050
there you can build it from source for

1305
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:45,230
whatever you need to do yeah there are a

1306
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,510
lot a lot of guides on the read the docs

1307
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,220
again we're gonna make all these slides

1308
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,420
available on our Twitter we'll post it

1309
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,610
out with the Dakota con hashtag and then

1310
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:56,540
our read mine has older more interesting

1311
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,750
setups for some more obscure operating

1312
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,610
systems and whatnot so yeah pretty easy

1313
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,670
to pull it down and get messing with it

1314
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:09,050
any other questions no okay we'll be out

1315
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,120
at our booth over there we have a whole

1316
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,820
bunch of stickers and some stuff if you

1317
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,920
want to come out say hi ask any

1318
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,900
questions we'll be there all day and

1319
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,130
then we'll be here tomorrow for the

1320
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,680
trainings and we'll hope to see you

1321
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,150
again

1322
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,800
[Applause]

1323
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,850
there's our Twitter if you want to

1324
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,530
follow us we post stuff above Network

1325
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,920
packets

1326
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:53,680
there's no that's that's theirs

1327
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:07,089
you'll just run over to the booth in

1328
00:51:07,089 --> 00:51:10,230
case anyone is rich okay

1329
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,330
justice okay

1330
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,970
well I think I'm gonna actually just

1331
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,250
start people can roll in as they get out

1332
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,750
of the other session if it's running

1333
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,500
late or whatever can everyone hear me

1334
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,840
find out the gist a podium mic like if

1335
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,480
I'd have a choice I'd rather not babysit

1336
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,570
a microphone so anyway my name is

1337
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,510
Michael Adama here to talk about

1338
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,600
blockchain and hopefully a way that

1339
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,330
isn't pure marketing because that's kind

1340
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,840
of been a problem of late so I'll do my

1341
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,830
best I'm a TSU grad I graduated in oh

1342
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,340
five currently living in Spain where I

1343
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,520
have a small company there we do

1344
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,980
research and development of these things

1345
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,080
so if you need research or development

1346
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,670
of those things

1347
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,790
there's the plug there's the website I

1348
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:26,640
also joined the intense coin team it's a

1349
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,690
cryptocurrency project it's a not really

1350
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:32,280
cryptocurrency it's called the token

1351
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,890
coin we'll get to it doesn't matter they

1352
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:37,950
are trying to build a decentralized VPN

1353
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,280
based entirely on blockchain so just

1354
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,200
joined that not too long ago so that's

1355
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,380
pretty cool anyway hype I lied there's

1356
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,300
some hype up front in case you haven't

1357
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,400
heard of blockchain we have to get the

1358
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,980
hype going so that you can pay attention

1359
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,380
to the rest of the talk otherwise you

1360
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,980
might not care from the go anyway where

1361
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,650
exactly is blockchain on the hype cycle

1362
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,020
the Gartner hype cycle comes out every

1363
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,570
year this is where it was last year so

1364
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,390
we are officially in the peak of

1365
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:12,930
inflated expectations descending into

1366
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,740
the trough of disillusionment not

1367
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,890
exactly what you want to have for your

1368
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:22,140
upcoming product or technology but

1369
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,450
that's that's kind of how all products

1370
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,250
and technologies go they go from early

1371
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,500
adopters up to everyone thinks it's the

1372
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,180
best thing in the world and reality sets

1373
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,370
in and then somewhere along the road it

1374
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,620
settles into an actual product that

1375
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:36,840
people use and then kindly ignore in ten

1376
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,680
years because it's so normal

1377
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,080
money-wise this is the market cap as of

1378
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,780
yesterday Bitcoin sitting at about a

1379
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,610
hundred and forty eight billion dollars

1380
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,040
market cap so kind of worth paying

1381
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,270
attention to

1382
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,490
the second one is aetherium at 53

1383
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,610
billion if you rewind a couple of months

1384
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,200
those numbers were much much more

1385
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:04,830
impressive but also totally fake yeah oh

1386
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:09,810
sure yeah I'm switch the VG yeah I have

1387
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:15,030
all the dongles all of them see if this

1388
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,300
works

1389
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,340
oh geez

1390
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,880
I'm gonna come back

1391
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:48,029
yay analog technology okay

1392
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:53,309
VGA let's give this a shot okay does

1393
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:54,920
that work cool

1394
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,240
so Bitcoin hundred forty eight billion

1395
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,190
dollars fifty three billion for the next

1396
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,770
one lots of money where does that sit in

1397
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,470
relationship to like common publicly

1398
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:06,510
traded companies so well Apple is at the

1399
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:11,010
top 750 billion in market cap then 579

1400
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:15,240
for alphabet aka Google so that seems

1401
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,430
like it's not really in the same league

1402
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:19,529
but these are the top five public

1403
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,170
companies in the world these are all

1404
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,700
companies that are valued less than

1405
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,849
Bitcoin right now small companies like

1406
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:30,690
Boeing McDonald's Broadcom Starbucks ups

1407
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,579
Nike Siemens Comcast Bank of China

1408
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,380
Unilever small little companies

1409
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,349
mom-and-pop shops that can't quite

1410
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:39,510
compete against the new technology

1411
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,720
that's only ten years old anyway

1412
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,760
investment is also going crazy because

1413
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,289
there's money to be had so there's money

1414
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:49,220
to be spent last year was coming up at

1415
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,770
its 900 million coming up on a billion

1416
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,510
dollars of investment in blockchain and

1417
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:57,329
I love the term block team adjacent

1418
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:01,200
startups so that's common investing with

1419
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,359
the goal that eventually those those

1420
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:06,000
companies will develop a product and go

1421
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,380
public and then they hit the stock

1422
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,799
market and then the the value inflates

1423
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,420
and they can cash out and make money on

1424
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,849
their investment and their ROI is 50 to

1425
00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:16,640
1 or something typical Silicon Valley

1426
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:22,200
expectations unicorn style levels but we

1427
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,029
don't need that anymore if you have the

1428
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:26,099
ability to have your own currency that

1429
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:29,490
is regulated by yourself much to the

1430
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:30,839
chagrin of many governments around the

1431
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,089
world so you can actually do instead of

1432
00:59:33,089 --> 00:59:34,740
an engine ischl public offering you can

1433
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,809
do an initial coin offering and you can

1434
00:59:36,809 --> 00:59:38,760
sell shares of your technology directly

1435
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,329
to people who want to give you money so

1436
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:44,160
you get a bit of cryptography in

1437
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,660
exchange for real money so who would do

1438
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,430
this well obviously a few people have

1439
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,970
done this these are the top Aiko's first

1440
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,880
one is 257 million that they raised the

1441
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,940
next was 232

1442
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,499
the website obviously didn't know how to

1443
00:59:57,499 --> 00:59:58,910
do commas so I'm sorry about the

1444
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:01,789
readability on the numbers so that's

1445
01:00:01,789 --> 01:00:02,839
quite a bit of money too

1446
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:05,900
so what we're seeing is that based on

1447
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,449
deal volume so the amount of deals that

1448
01:00:08,449 --> 01:00:10,190
are closed there's still more deals

1449
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,680
being closed in venture capital than in

1450
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,009
ICO's but the amount of money coming in

1451
01:00:16,009 --> 01:00:18,499
from those initial coin offerings is

1452
01:00:18,499 --> 01:00:23,989
massive its way it it's about 78% its

1453
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:26,119
four-fifths of the the money coming in

1454
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:30,680
is coming in from Aiko's last month it

1455
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,920
was 1.4 billion in ICO investment so

1456
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,469
last month total it's about 8 billion

1457
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:41,420
why that's what I'm here to try to

1458
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,890
explain so that's the hype that's why

1459
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,420
everyone's going crazy that there's this

1460
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:46,579
money being thrown around for blockchain

1461
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:48,559
what is blockchain does anyone know what

1462
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,999
blockchain is it's like yeah or from a

1463
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:55,279
quote from a movie that I really like or

1464
01:00:55,279 --> 01:00:57,019
do you just have like a throwaway line

1465
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:58,130
so you don't look stupid in a

1466
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,079
conversation like oh yeah that's that

1467
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,660
then and then you fall off and hopefully

1468
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,390
nobody ask you any more questions so

1469
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:08,239
block team versus Bitcoin those get kind

1470
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:12,949
of mixed up interchangeably a little

1471
01:01:12,949 --> 01:01:14,839
disclaimer to throughout the rest of the

1472
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:15,499
presentation

1473
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:19,339
I could be well actually to death up

1474
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:21,859
here I'm trying my best to explain this

1475
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:25,279
in a way that is gonna work for a

1476
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:26,599
general audience that may or may not

1477
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,999
have experience with it or care about

1478
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:31,009
certain aspects of it you could talk for

1479
01:01:31,009 --> 01:01:33,890
an hour about mining just by itself so

1480
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,170
you can well actually meet later in the

1481
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,529
hallway and we can talk about it

1482
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:41,660
blockchain is a technology Bitcoin is an

1483
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,119
application they were invented at the

1484
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:46,969
same time blockchain was invented in

1485
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:50,059
2008 for use in Bitcoin it was a means

1486
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:51,910
to an end

1487
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:54,969
Bitcoin solved a previously unsolved

1488
01:01:54,969 --> 01:01:58,239
problem and created a new product

1489
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:05,709
Bitcoin this problem was was only or was

1490
01:02:05,709 --> 01:02:07,830
thought about for

1491
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:09,540
long time and we're gonna go through the

1492
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,060
problem but this was the breakthrough

1493
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,230
blockchain was the thing that solved

1494
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,080
this fundamental problem that enabled

1495
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,330
Bitcoin to happen and the thing that

1496
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,370
Bitcoin enabled or created was

1497
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,800
decentralized electronic cash electronic

1498
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,260
cash that you could send peer-to-peer

1499
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,900
without an intermediary so you had true

1500
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,730
peer-to-peer payments for the first time

1501
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,590
without both people having to trust

1502
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,050
someone you have electronic payments

1503
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,030
online if you send your money to PayPal

1504
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:39,210
and trust them and then PayPal sends

1505
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:42,120
your money to someone else hopefully so

1506
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,470
you have an intermediary that you both

1507
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:47,190
trusts this allows that transaction to

1508
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:48,750
happen without an intermediary and

1509
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,520
that's the magic so it's a really a

1510
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,040
breakthrough technology it can record

1511
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,260
transactions accurately without a

1512
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:57,110
central authority between all these

1513
01:02:57,110 --> 01:03:04,320
distributed entities so the technology

1514
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,120
itself is actually decentralized

1515
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,060
consensus and it opens up an entirely

1516
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,860
new way to think about building network

1517
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,750
applications if you don't have to build

1518
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,640
this central authority where people

1519
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,720
don't have to trust that central

1520
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,130
authority or what other kind of

1521
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:18,570
applications could you build this is the

1522
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:22,140
interesting question mate sound a little

1523
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:22,680
familiar

1524
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,750
it's like inventing email and creating

1525
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,510
the Internet as a byproduct and wow we

1526
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,340
can send messages to other to each other

1527
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,230
this is fantastic what else can we use

1528
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,610
on this I don't know it seems kind of

1529
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,320
useful though I mean maybe over the next

1530
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,030
3040 years we'll find some other uses

1531
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:38,940
for this gigantic network so that's kind

1532
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,570
of where we're at super early days for

1533
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:46,380
blockchain the general problem that they

1534
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,760
solved is called the Byzantine generals

1535
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,740
problem who's heard of this or seen it

1536
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,260
like in a text book or a paper or

1537
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,330
whatever okay so I'm gonna do my best

1538
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,390
with lovely graphics to try and explain

1539
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:58,770
this problem this is the problem that

1540
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:00,390
they solved and this is the core thing

1541
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:04,170
to understand you have four generals or

1542
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:08,190
X generals surrounding village or fort

1543
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,870
or castle or something that they want to

1544
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,790
take over and there's no way that they

1545
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:14,970
can like get on a conference call and

1546
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:16,770
talk to each other and say what are we

1547
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,870
gonna do so they all have their own plan

1548
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:20,760
at the beginning of the day and they

1549
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,820
have to make a plan for

1550
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,980
so they think well that's 8 o'clock 7

1551
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,390
o'clock 10 o'clock whatever we need to

1552
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,890
somehow communicate with each other and

1553
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:29,410
come up with a plan but we can't all

1554
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,210
talk at the same time we can't all meet

1555
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:34,540
were located in physically separate

1556
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:38,320
places so the first one writes a little

1557
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,700
note and sends it on a writer and says

1558
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,680
we're gonna attack at 8:00 and the guy

1559
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,390
looks at it says up yeah sure

1560
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:45,550
8 sounds great sends it on to the next

1561
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:47,920
one on his writer and this the other

1562
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,150
general sorry I'm not seeing my preview

1563
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,410
okay yeah

1564
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:54,880
so the second general that they send it

1565
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,740
to says I don't want to attack a date I

1566
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,750
want to tack at 9:00 so he crumples up

1567
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,480
that piece of paper and writes 9 o'clock

1568
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,100
then sends it to the last guy and the

1569
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,660
guy says what 95 works for me that's

1570
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,880
perfect and he send it back to the first

1571
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,260
guy and he says well that's not the plan

1572
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:11,680
so what happened I did did they all want

1573
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,470
to go at 9:00 or just one guy or nobody

1574
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:16,630
or like did somebody kill the writer

1575
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:19,180
along the way then we nobody knows so

1576
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:22,630
how do you solve this how does

1577
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,670
blockchain help these generals how do we

1578
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,260
make an analogy to what blockchain does

1579
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:29,200
to what this general problem is still

1580
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,400
have the generals they still have

1581
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,890
different plans first guy writes his

1582
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:36,270
message says we're gonna go at 8 now the

1583
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,290
thing we have to change is how the

1584
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:41,530
messages are created creating a message

1585
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,320
always takes a fixed amount of time this

1586
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,600
is the important part if you want to

1587
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,490
make a message it's got to take five

1588
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,400
minutes sounds arbitrary but that's

1589
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,990
that's the rule if you want to write a

1590
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,970
message has to take five minutes so the

1591
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,130
guy writes his message it could be on a

1592
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:58,810
piece of paper maybe he has to carve it

1593
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:01,540
out of a chunk of wood or something and

1594
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,060
he writes his plan and who he is and who

1595
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,250
it's to and and then at the end he draws

1596
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,880
a picture of a horse and he sends it to

1597
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,990
the next guy and he looks at it and

1598
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:15,040
reads the whole message and sees that

1599
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,570
there's a picture of a horse so he knows

1600
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:17,770
that it took five minutes because it

1601
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,940
takes a while to draw a picture of a

1602
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,820
horse and he goes okay yep sure a clock

1603
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:25,330
that works for me now this is where we

1604
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:26,830
change things we don't reuse the message

1605
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:29,680
he doesn't send that slate onward he

1606
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,750
doesn't change it and just like add his

1607
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,640
name at the bottom he creates a whole

1608
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,640
new message

1609
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,569
takes another five minutes and you know

1610
01:06:38,569 --> 01:06:39,680
goes into the tent

1611
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,569
and writes the message and takes five

1612
01:06:41,569 --> 01:06:43,339
minutes he comes out and the rider knows

1613
01:06:43,339 --> 01:06:45,289
that he has created a unique message

1614
01:06:45,289 --> 01:06:47,000
because it took five minutes he's

1615
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,319
waiting outside the tent for the guy to

1616
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:50,349
write his message he comes back out

1617
01:06:50,349 --> 01:06:53,029
creates the message he writes it in the

1618
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:55,069
same way this is for the the next

1619
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:57,260
general from this general draws a

1620
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:01,069
picture of his horse and then sends its

1621
01:07:01,069 --> 01:07:02,750
on its way we changed the way messages

1622
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:07,069
are distributed by always appending all

1623
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:09,440
messages to all previous messages so we

1624
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,150
don't just send the latest message we

1625
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:12,650
send all the messages that have ever

1626
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:15,740
been sent in this communication so now

1627
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:19,010
the second guy gets both messages and he

1628
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,599
knows that east through each message

1629
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:23,299
took five minutes to create and he knows

1630
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:25,039
he sees two pictures of two distinct

1631
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,380
horses and so he's pretty satisfied by

1632
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:29,690
all that he agrees at eight o'clock he

1633
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:32,539
goes into the tent and he writes his

1634
01:07:32,539 --> 01:07:33,859
message for five minutes and draws a

1635
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:35,690
picture of his horse and sends it to the

1636
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:38,059
last guy now the last guy knows that all

1637
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:40,130
three generals want to go at eight

1638
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:43,000
o'clock and those are all valid messages

1639
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,920
and he says well I want to go at ten

1640
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,119
that's stupid

1641
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:49,700
eight o'clock sway too early crumples up

1642
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,980
all the messages or destroys him and

1643
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:54,109
then he goes into the tent to write the

1644
01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:55,819
final communication well after five

1645
01:07:55,819 --> 01:07:58,400
minutes he's interrupted are you done

1646
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,500
writing the message oh not really I've

1647
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,440
only written this one well send that

1648
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,960
along the last guy gets only one message

1649
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,079
he knows something has gone wrong so

1650
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:10,819
those previous messages have been thrown

1651
01:08:10,819 --> 01:08:12,799
away they've been they were attempted to

1652
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:16,250
be altered if the last guy had 20

1653
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,259
minutes to make his message he could

1654
01:08:18,259 --> 01:08:20,658
Forge all the other messages in time and

1655
01:08:20,658 --> 01:08:22,698
and create consensus that way but he

1656
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:25,158
can't he only has five minutes to create

1657
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:27,319
a message all the messages have to come

1658
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:29,120
along and so the last guy knows

1659
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,429
something's wrong some something has

1660
01:08:31,429 --> 01:08:31,969
happened

1661
01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:34,158
we don't have consensus we don't all

1662
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:37,158
agree on what the state of this plan is

1663
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:41,060
so how does that relate to blockchain it

1664
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,649
seems a little arbitrary during drawing

1665
01:08:42,649 --> 01:08:44,630
pictures of horses and carving things

1666
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:48,229
into slates so each general

1667
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:51,040
in this analogy is a node on the network

1668
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,630
it's an instance of a decentralized

1669
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,339
application so it's a piece of piece of

1670
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:57,170
software running on your computer that's

1671
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,350
the general sitting there on the network

1672
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:02,359
the network itself is the rider going

1673
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,710
back and forth that's pretty

1674
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,220
straightforward every message that is

1675
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:10,460
being sent we call that a transaction

1676
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,979
not a message it's just a transaction

1677
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:17,450
going from A to B in some way each block

1678
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:20,000
can contain multiple transactions so

1679
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,520
don't picture the guy carving out a

1680
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,630
single sheet of paper

1681
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,299
picture him like slapping the picture of

1682
01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:29,180
a horse on the front of a book like a

1683
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,399
whole bunch of messages that he's done

1684
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:34,250
writing then he does the you know five

1685
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,380
minutes operation puts them together and

1686
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:41,450
sends it along its way each of these

1687
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:43,460
blocks or chunks of messages must be

1688
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,200
created in a fixed amount of time and

1689
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,630
that's called the block time for Bitcoin

1690
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:48,799
that's ten minutes every ten minutes

1691
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:51,890
would make a new block and this proof of

1692
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:55,100
work that's the guy in the tent carving

1693
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,350
out the message or drawing the picture

1694
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:59,300
of the horse some sort of effort has to

1695
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,850
be expended to create the message and

1696
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:04,640
it's some sort of effort that you can

1697
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,800
easily verify so it shouldn't take ten

1698
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,090
minutes to create in ten minutes to

1699
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,260
verify that it'd be horrible

1700
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,910
it should take ten minutes to create and

1701
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,500
you glance at it and go yeah that looks

1702
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,570
like a picture of a horse difficulty

1703
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:19,100
we're trying to create a fixed amount of

1704
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,410
time some people are better at drawing

1705
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:22,940
than others so maybe they can draw a

1706
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:26,210
really quick so then you don't say we'll

1707
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,860
draw a picture of a horse maybe you have

1708
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,330
a whole fleet of generals and they're

1709
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:31,400
really good at drawing pictures so you

1710
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,890
say well draw for horses it slows them

1711
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:35,810
down so that they still take five

1712
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,920
minutes to create their messages so

1713
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,530
enough about drawing horses mining not

1714
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,810
every general wants to draw horses right

1715
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:46,640
they're not gonna sit in the tent and

1716
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,440
draw the horses themselves so they would

1717
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,210
outsource that to somebody else in their

1718
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:51,560
crew that really wants to do it and

1719
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,989
maybe pay the money to do it this is the

1720
01:10:53,989 --> 01:10:56,180
mining function of blockchain somebody

1721
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:58,010
has to do this effort to create these

1722
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:59,840
messages and provide validity to the

1723
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,760
network so since you're expending

1724
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,030
effort and electricity probably you

1725
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:06,980
should be rewarded for that because if

1726
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:10,460
no one's doing that function the network

1727
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,349
stops that's the thing that keeps the

1728
01:11:12,349 --> 01:11:16,400
network running so it's rewarded anyway

1729
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,809
and blockchain pretty straightforward is

1730
01:11:17,809 --> 01:11:19,340
a sequence of blocks you're changing the

1731
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,019
blocks together every time you append a

1732
01:11:21,019 --> 01:11:23,840
message you have a bigger chunk of of

1733
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,369
material and the important part is you

1734
01:11:28,369 --> 01:11:30,800
have this big chain of blocks this big

1735
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,070
sequence of messages but everyone has a

1736
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:36,139
big sequence of messages all those

1737
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:37,909
messages are distributed to every

1738
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:40,340
participant in the network all the time

1739
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:45,289
so everybody has this information and

1740
01:11:45,289 --> 01:11:48,860
then it's usually called a public ledger

1741
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:51,349
so a ledger is like an accounting you

1742
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,900
know your your plus balance and your

1743
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,429
minus or your ins and out credits and

1744
01:11:55,429 --> 01:11:57,440
debits you have this ledger of things

1745
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,730
that were transacted and there's a

1746
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:00,769
specific order to them everyone has a

1747
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:04,369
copy of that ledger so everyone has a

1748
01:12:04,369 --> 01:12:06,050
copy of every transaction and every

1749
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:08,300
message that was ever sent and that

1750
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,280
means that every node in the network can

1751
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,619
know the truth so if somebody starts

1752
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:15,289
lying everyone could say that guy's a

1753
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,619
liar that I mean 51 percent of us know

1754
01:12:18,619 --> 01:12:20,929
that this is wrong so that's ignore

1755
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:22,869
those messages from this other node

1756
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:26,030
that's how we get consensus everyone

1757
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,289
knows the truth all the time they can

1758
01:12:27,289 --> 01:12:30,710
all talk to each other all the time so

1759
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:34,250
if there's no central authority how do

1760
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,150
we have like user accounts you know if

1761
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,500
you want to sign up for a service online

1762
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,030
you have to sign up for a service and

1763
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:42,440
like register an account and then they

1764
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,539
send you a confirmation email and you

1765
01:12:44,539 --> 01:12:45,739
click on a link and it goes to their

1766
01:12:45,739 --> 01:12:47,480
site and it activates your account like

1767
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,489
who does that function in this

1768
01:12:49,489 --> 01:12:52,360
distributed decentralized application

1769
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,340
you don't that's the answer you don't

1770
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:58,099
create accounts you just create public

1771
01:12:58,099 --> 01:13:00,949
and private keys so common you know PKI

1772
01:13:00,949 --> 01:13:02,539
infrastructure you create a pair of

1773
01:13:02,539 --> 01:13:05,030
public private keys and you use those to

1774
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,289
interact with the network and other

1775
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:10,269
users on the network the public key is

1776
01:13:10,269 --> 01:13:12,500
something like your username on the

1777
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,210
network on the blockchain network

1778
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:18,680
that's what people send messages to so

1779
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,450
if you've seen like donate you know

1780
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:24,470
donate Bitcoin buttons or sections on a

1781
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,240
website it's like a really long string

1782
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,950
of random characters it looks like

1783
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:30,380
that's the public key and that's that's

1784
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,090
their address on the network that's your

1785
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:35,060
user name on the network the private key

1786
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,060
is like your password well actually yeah

1787
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:42,350
it's like your password so you just to

1788
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:43,280
think about those two pieces of

1789
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,290
information in that way you can generate

1790
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,180
them independently of the blockchain and

1791
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,730
you know on your computer privately you

1792
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:50,960
don't need permission from anyone to

1793
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,190
interact with the network you create

1794
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:54,310
your username and password by yourself

1795
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:57,830
so I sign messages to you with my

1796
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:59,210
private key if I want to send you a

1797
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,920
message I sign that message with my

1798
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,290
private key and I address it to your

1799
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:06,110
public key and I put that message into

1800
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:09,890
the network and then everyone validates

1801
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:13,310
the message integrity with my public key

1802
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,650
so everyone knows that I sent the

1803
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:17,450
message and only I could have sent the

1804
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:19,490
message or at least only the person that

1805
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:22,130
has my private key so there's

1806
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:23,570
confirmation from everyone in the

1807
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:24,800
network that the message that I'm

1808
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,260
sending is valid it also confirms that

1809
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:31,520
only I could have sent it put another

1810
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,210
way in Bitcoin land your public key is

1811
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:38,510
used to deposit things and your private

1812
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:43,100
key is used to withdraw things so this

1813
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,470
is where the term wallet comes into play

1814
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:48,770
and I don't really like this term does

1815
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,840
anyone have a wallet her has run a

1816
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,260
wallet Bitcoin wallets yeah okay so the

1817
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:56,180
wallet is participating in the Bitcoin

1818
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,010
network and it's downloading all the

1819
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:00,770
transactions so it can know the truth of

1820
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,630
the world right the true state of the

1821
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:06,350
Bitcoin network and that's how you

1822
01:15:06,350 --> 01:15:07,790
participate on the network if you don't

1823
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:08,360
have a wallet

1824
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,450
you can't know what's going on so this

1825
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:14,120
is a horrible term once you get out of

1826
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:18,200
Bitcoin land it's a really bad way to

1827
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,810
call it it's just a pair of keys it's

1828
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,520
not a wallet it's not like a physical

1829
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,010
wallet that you have on your computer if

1830
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,630
anyone has your keys they have your

1831
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:27,540
Bitcoin so it's

1832
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:30,030
like your wallet is a physical thing

1833
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:36,060
that you could like you could lose you

1834
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,490
only lost your keys if you lose your

1835
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:41,250
keys you lose your wallet if you have

1836
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,720
your keys written down on a piece of

1837
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,270
paper like if you'd actually take the

1838
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:47,220
big long hash that's your private key

1839
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,450
and write it down on a piece of paper

1840
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:50,910
you can destroy your computer you can

1841
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:53,220
set it on fire and throw it away and you

1842
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,250
get a new computer and you could type in

1843
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:58,350
the key that you wrote down that's your

1844
01:15:58,350 --> 01:15:59,820
private key and you could get your

1845
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,950
wallet back so it's not in a physical

1846
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:05,330
space it's just a piece of information

1847
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:07,620
has anyone heard the story the super

1848
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,000
famous story of the guy in England that

1849
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,680
mined a bunch of Bitcoin and threw away

1850
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,870
his hard drive like it was worth

1851
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:15,480
hundreds of millions of pounds and so he

1852
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,950
started hiring people to go search

1853
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:18,540
through landfills to try and find his

1854
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,870
hard drive yeah keep your private keys

1855
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:26,100
safe and remember that you have those

1856
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,350
Bitcoin also 50 cent just realized he

1857
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,540
took Bitcoin donations for an album like

1858
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:33,750
five years ago and the discovery has now

1859
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:36,000
5 million bucks in the bank in Bitcoin

1860
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,830
after everything went through the roof

1861
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:39,990
so you know keep track of these things

1862
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:43,920
they can change in time here's a good

1863
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,450
question if you're writing software if

1864
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:46,620
you're gonna build something new is

1865
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,230
blockchain even applicable and this is

1866
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:51,120
where the hype really goes crazy

1867
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,340
everyone just puts a big layer of

1868
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:56,280
blockchain on there their product or

1869
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,990
they at least their marketing pitch I

1870
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,790
just put that icing on there and then

1871
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:01,320
they hope somebody comes and invests in

1872
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,020
their company kodak did it so now we're

1873
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,870
gonna make blockchain digital rights

1874
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,840
management for photos or something and

1875
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,970
they got investment some coffee shop it

1876
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,440
was just called itself blockchain

1877
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,180
something something and they were

1878
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,490
suddenly super famous so everyone's

1879
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:20,270
doing this but should you as an engineer

1880
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:23,040
do you need a datastore if you don't

1881
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,170
need to store data you don't need a

1882
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:27,990
block chain if everything is stateless

1883
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,940
and just kind of is like a processing

1884
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,520
application you don't need blocking if

1885
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,320
you do need to store data do you have

1886
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,290
multiple writers there's only one who

1887
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:40,650
cares don't don't worry about it

1888
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:43,500
just just write to your file and call it

1889
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,850
good but are there multiple concurrent

1890
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:46,770
writers can they trip each other up

1891
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:50,280
that's important to manage and then do

1892
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:54,719
the transaction order matter if it

1893
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,130
doesn't then you don't need it either

1894
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,139
because the whole problem that it solves

1895
01:17:58,139 --> 01:17:59,940
is ordering the transactions for

1896
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:03,290
multiple writers and disparate Network

1897
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:06,780
and then are there actually any

1898
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,730
untrusted participants if it's some

1899
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,130
internal product for your company and it

1900
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:13,290
goes between components that you've

1901
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:16,409
generated that you've engineered five

1902
01:18:16,409 --> 01:18:17,730
components that you've engineered every

1903
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:20,520
single one of them there's not really

1904
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,020
any untrusted participants so you

1905
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,170
probably don't need to do it either and

1906
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:26,550
if there are untrusted participants

1907
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:29,580
could a third party be used so try and

1908
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,110
think of a situation where a third party

1909
01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:33,530
can't be used a trusted third party

1910
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:35,340
sometimes it's kind of difficult because

1911
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:39,000
we just trust like all Facebook's in the

1912
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,139
news oops we you know like sign up for

1913
01:18:43,139 --> 01:18:44,969
this account with my other credentials

1914
01:18:44,969 --> 01:18:47,219
and that's a that's a great mediator of

1915
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:49,290
private information this other company

1916
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:50,670
and I don't care because it makes my

1917
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:53,010
life easy but what happens if you

1918
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:54,719
couldn't trust third party and what well

1919
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,619
what would a situation be like that

1920
01:18:57,619 --> 01:19:00,449
anything international if you're dealing

1921
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:04,500
with regulation between countries there

1922
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,690
is no one higher than each country

1923
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:09,330
individually so if this country has an

1924
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:10,800
idea of the truth and this other country

1925
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,510
has an idea of the truth there's no

1926
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,110
mediator

1927
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:16,409
so those are two untrusted parties there

1928
01:19:16,409 --> 01:19:17,940
might be diplomatic consequences or

1929
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:19,110
whatever but if you're talking about

1930
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:21,239
let's say a car registry in between

1931
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:26,429
different countries or roaming roaming

1932
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:28,980
between different mobile providers they

1933
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:31,350
need to settle their bills somehow so if

1934
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,270
one person lies and says oh yeah your

1935
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,739
customer was on my network and made like

1936
01:19:34,739 --> 01:19:37,949
$10,000 worth of calls pay me there's no

1937
01:19:37,949 --> 01:19:39,989
one to mediate that dispute it's between

1938
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:41,610
two telecoms that might be

1939
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,190
government-owned anyway no one steps in

1940
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:46,699
so they need to have some sort of

1941
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:49,860
untrusted validation that's where it

1942
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:50,699
comes in we

1943
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:54,179
interesting becomes very interesting I

1944
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:56,800
didn't mention one thing because this is

1945
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,030
the current problem with blockchain

1946
01:19:58,030 --> 01:20:00,790
scalability how many transactions per

1947
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:03,429
second do you need I hope it's not very

1948
01:20:03,429 --> 01:20:06,699
many it's very slow as you can imagine

1949
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:09,460
you have a gigantic network of thousands

1950
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,260
and thousands of nodes that all have to

1951
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:13,949
reach consensus every step along the way

1952
01:20:13,949 --> 01:20:17,199
or the majority of them have to reach

1953
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,270
consensus along the way and they all

1954
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:21,330
have to process every single transaction

1955
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:25,449
every single one so where are we at visa

1956
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:27,429
can do about twenty four thousand

1957
01:20:27,429 --> 01:20:32,560
transactions per second which is a lot

1958
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,900
more than the fastest blockchain

1959
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:38,139
competitor ripple was designed to be

1960
01:20:38,139 --> 01:20:41,080
very very fast and it can only do 1500

1961
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,989
per second and it falls off pretty quick

1962
01:20:43,989 --> 01:20:47,320
after that bitcoins way at the end with

1963
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:51,310
seven seven transactions per second so

1964
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,949
don't build anything too finely grained

1965
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:58,349
or two doesn't need to be too reactive

1966
01:20:58,349 --> 01:21:00,520
but there's a portent thing to keep in

1967
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:05,139
mind Visa was founded in 1958 it's had a

1968
01:21:05,139 --> 01:21:07,389
while they've had some time to figure

1969
01:21:07,389 --> 01:21:09,369
out how to make this really fast ripple

1970
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:11,679
was invented six years ago with the

1971
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,330
technology that was only available ten

1972
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:16,900
years ago so you know cut them a little

1973
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,849
bit of slack they'll probably figure it

1974
01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:19,440
out

1975
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,330
this is the major focus of blockchain

1976
01:21:22,330 --> 01:21:24,760
innovation right now is how to scale

1977
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,270
this how do we maintain consensus

1978
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:31,199
provable consensus and still scale it up

1979
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:35,260
right now they use proof of work proof

1980
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,560
of work is drawing the horse or

1981
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,139
calculating the answer to a math problem

1982
01:21:40,139 --> 01:21:42,340
but they're also working on proof of

1983
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,710
stake which is if I have a bunch of

1984
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:48,639
money in this currency I'll just bet you

1985
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:51,130
that my answers are correct so I'll take

1986
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:53,290
a chunk of my coins and put them in a

1987
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:56,010
place that I can't touch and if I keep

1988
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:58,090
providing false information to the

1989
01:21:58,090 --> 01:21:59,679
network other people verify it and say

1990
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,800
it's wrong then they're rewarded for

1991
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,100
proving that I'm

1992
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,440
so I'm betting you money that I'm

1993
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,570
telling the truth on my node basically

1994
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:11,360
and if I'm not my money goes away so

1995
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,630
there's a no need to do some massive

1996
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,520
calculation you're just betting that

1997
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,130
people are not gonna lie and lose their

1998
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,470
money and then they're rewarded for also

1999
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,120
participating in the network so that's

2000
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,350
an interesting one proof of stake is

2001
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:27,880
very interesting proof of authority is

2002
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,990
kind of starts to smell like

2003
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:33,080
centralization right no these guys are

2004
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,910
good and these guys are bad so who says

2005
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:36,410
that they're good and bad hmm

2006
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:38,090
starts to get a little shaky but of

2007
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,470
course things get a lot quicker if you

2008
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:41,210
can just trust a few nodes to generate

2009
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:45,190
positive and verifiable information

2010
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,900
there's a couple ways you can scale just

2011
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,120
like a database instead of having every

2012
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,220
node Trant process every transaction

2013
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:55,430
every time well only the even-numbered

2014
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:57,890
nodes try a process the even

2015
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,450
transactions and only the odd number

2016
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:01,280
nodes trand process the oddness

2017
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,960
transactions so there's a 50% gain there

2018
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:07,610
you can do it again you can make it more

2019
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:09,620
fine-grain but at some point you need

2020
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:12,080
only scales linearly it's not it's not

2021
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,040
like a solution really there's also

2022
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,320
research going into off chain operations

2023
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,230
where you have what they call an anchor

2024
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:23,480
of truth inside the network so let's say

2025
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,210
I'm playing checkers to play checkers on

2026
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,790
a bit a blockchain network would take a

2027
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:31,580
long time so I make a move

2028
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,320
everyone confirms the transaction then I

2029
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,180
move this checker to this square and

2030
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:36,530
then everyone confirms okay yeah and

2031
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:38,180
then the other player is free to go and

2032
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,280
they can make their move and then every

2033
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,570
everybody in the entire network

2034
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:44,870
processes that move so that's not that

2035
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:46,700
would not work right now so what they do

2036
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:49,670
is say I'm gonna make a move and then

2037
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:51,170
we're both going to sign each other's

2038
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:54,320
moves at off of the chain in between us

2039
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,490
two we establish a peer-to-peer

2040
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:57,800
connection we talk to each other every

2041
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,570
time you make a move I use a key and

2042
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:02,150
sign it and then you sign my move and

2043
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:03,980
back and forth and back and forth and

2044
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:07,370
you make this state channel so you have

2045
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:09,170
the sequence of events that's in a

2046
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:12,380
channel that progresses through many

2047
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,570
many many different states every change

2048
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:16,310
in state is signed along the way and

2049
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:17,750
then it goes back

2050
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,460
to the blockchain and somebody verifies

2051
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:22,040
it so that that final state is sent back

2052
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,450
to the blockchain there's a reward

2053
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,220
function for somebody to verify that

2054
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:27,560
yeah all those moves make sense all

2055
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,600
those signatures make sense and then

2056
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,270
they confirm that it is a valid sequence

2057
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,310
of transactions so that's how you can

2058
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:37,910
speed things up where not every single

2059
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:39,710
step of the way is so important to be

2060
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:41,560
recorded in the blockchain

2061
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:44,180
there's also side chains this is called

2062
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:46,420
sorry the last ones called raid and then

2063
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:49,070
in one of the projects I'll talk about

2064
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:51,110
in a bit aetherium that's they call that

2065
01:24:51,110 --> 01:24:53,330
Raiden the research is going into that

2066
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,480
side chains and that's called plasma

2067
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,920
basically instead of having one chain

2068
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,480
that everyone follows you can like make

2069
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:02,450
a little side chain over here and do a

2070
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:04,820
bunch of independent operations it's

2071
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,110
kind of like a state channel but it's

2072
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:08,240
formed as a block chain independent of

2073
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,250
the other one and then it loops back in

2074
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:13,250
and connects back to the main chain also

2075
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:14,840
a validation function on that to make

2076
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,210
sure that everything is you know what

2077
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:18,980
they know that nobody's lying in that

2078
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,200
situation either

2079
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:24,790
so aetherium who's heard of aetherium oh

2080
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:27,470
it's pretty good awesome

2081
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:32,750
yeah aetherium is pretty cool so I'll

2082
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,970
talk about it a bit this is actually the

2083
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,530
next section is completely on a theorem

2084
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,060
so it a theory and foundation grants

2085
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:39,830
just to show that scalability is like a

2086
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:41,900
big deal these were awarded on the

2087
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:45,950
seventh and look what the top money went

2088
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:48,320
to one and a half million for

2089
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,600
scalability another hundred thousand for

2090
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,610
scalability another fifty thousand for

2091
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:54,140
scalability another twenty five and

2092
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:58,280
twenty five so the gross percent are the

2093
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,010
majority of the money and these research

2094
01:26:01,010 --> 01:26:02,840
grants went for scalability with the top

2095
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:05,600
prize one and a half million compared to

2096
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,450
the next one it's three times over the

2097
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:12,010
next one so lots of money being put into

2098
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:16,750
scalability research aetherium is cool

2099
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:19,590
atheria Miz pretty cool

2100
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:24,030
if Bitcoin was blockchain 1.0 where we

2101
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:26,010
just you know prove the concept and show

2102
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:27,840
that it worked and got people excited

2103
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,850
that this was a possibility now that

2104
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:32,970
this problem had been solved that was in

2105
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:36,870
2008 and launched in 2009 aetherium

2106
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:38,880
seems to be something like blockchain

2107
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,840
2.0 it was proposed in 2013 and launched

2108
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:48,330
in 2015 by a guy who is invited you know

2109
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:50,250
every recording an interview with him

2110
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,950
it's just staring into someone who's

2111
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:54,600
very very smart and then you rewind the

2112
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,150
video and listen to it again because wow

2113
01:26:57,150 --> 01:27:00,690
ok you figured that out by yourself very

2114
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:02,730
cool to watch the introductory video of

2115
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:05,160
him proposing this idea too because it's

2116
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,440
a one guy from Canada like a group of

2117
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,390
researchers now are working there and

2118
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:13,040
it's turned to this gigantic engineering

2119
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,630
force there's tons of money being put

2120
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,280
into it because they're innovating like

2121
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,410
crazy

2122
01:27:18,410 --> 01:27:20,670
Bitcoin only implements really really

2123
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:24,450
basic scripting right send this amount

2124
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:27,420
of this coin to this person with this

2125
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:30,030
key with this signature so people were

2126
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:31,740
trying to innovate within that space and

2127
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,690
trying to like kind of abuse those

2128
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:35,070
parameters to implement other

2129
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:37,340
applications on top of this network and

2130
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:41,220
they kept running into limitations it

2131
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:43,320
wasn't designed to do much and so then

2132
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:46,470
they would make a copy of the code start

2133
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,870
a new cryptocurrency that did a specific

2134
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:50,760
other thing and this happened over and

2135
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,470
over and over dozens and dozens of time

2136
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:54,750
to implement one specific application so

2137
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:59,190
this guy said what if it just let you

2138
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,920
program inside the blockchain instead of

2139
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,020
having the blockchain be a fixed set of

2140
01:28:04,020 --> 01:28:06,390
functions why don't we just allow

2141
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:09,330
languages to be compiled and loaded into

2142
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:12,300
the blockchain and executed so they have

2143
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,580
turing-complete languages languages not

2144
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,470
just one they've come through for now

2145
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:18,990
mutant lol serpent and solidity and

2146
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:21,570
solidity looks pretty approachable

2147
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:25,590
it looks like JavaScript that little bit

2148
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:29,670
of code is implements your own

2149
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,130
cryptocurrency you allocate coins and

2150
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:33,269
you can distribute them and you can

2151
01:28:33,269 --> 01:28:34,979
for them between people and you only

2152
01:28:34,979 --> 01:28:36,629
need that's not the entire thing but

2153
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:39,809
let's say 100 lines of code and in 100

2154
01:28:39,809 --> 01:28:41,159
lines of code you can implement your own

2155
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,409
cryptocurrency on top of the etherium

2156
01:28:43,409 --> 01:28:47,039
Network so this was huge and they of

2157
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:48,269
course had to come up name for it

2158
01:28:48,269 --> 01:28:50,579
distributed apps the apps i don't know

2159
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:52,079
how you say it I don't think anyone's

2160
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:53,909
ever said it in public probably but

2161
01:28:53,909 --> 01:28:55,979
decentralized applications suddenly you

2162
01:28:55,979 --> 01:28:56,699
don't need to build your own

2163
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,139
infrastructure you don't need to come up

2164
01:28:58,139 --> 01:28:59,879
with how do I build my blockchain how do

2165
01:28:59,879 --> 01:29:01,319
I get people to join it I need to have

2166
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:03,859
scale before it'll even process anything

2167
01:29:03,859 --> 01:29:07,019
it's there it's running it's a virtual

2168
01:29:07,019 --> 01:29:08,969
machine it's a decentralized virtual

2169
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:11,119
machine that you can program for and

2170
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:14,299
they call these things smart contracts

2171
01:29:14,299 --> 01:29:16,379
so a little chunks of code that you can

2172
01:29:16,379 --> 01:29:18,209
stick up in there and interact with and

2173
01:29:18,209 --> 01:29:22,559
since they're provably secure or that

2174
01:29:22,559 --> 01:29:24,809
consensus will be reached on them you

2175
01:29:24,809 --> 01:29:26,819
can do things simple things you can like

2176
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:29,879
vote over them you could do insurance

2177
01:29:29,879 --> 01:29:31,969
contracts over them health records

2178
01:29:31,969 --> 01:29:36,749
establish provenance on a piece of art

2179
01:29:36,749 --> 01:29:42,419
or a piece of piece of meat actually I'm

2180
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:44,299
gonna talk about cows in a bit anyway

2181
01:29:44,299 --> 01:29:47,729
royalties people implement distribution

2182
01:29:47,729 --> 01:29:50,189
rights for music on top of it you embed

2183
01:29:50,189 --> 01:29:53,939
a little bit of cryptography into songs

2184
01:29:53,939 --> 01:29:56,569
and have it ping back and automatically

2185
01:29:56,569 --> 01:29:58,859
transfer money when the song is used

2186
01:29:58,859 --> 01:30:03,179
things that are you know good by paper

2187
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:05,459
pushers if they think that deep learning

2188
01:30:05,459 --> 01:30:07,709
and sensor technology is going to get

2189
01:30:07,709 --> 01:30:09,629
rid of all the drivers in the world this

2190
01:30:09,629 --> 01:30:11,279
might get rid of all the bureaucrats in

2191
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:12,599
the world this might get rid of every

2192
01:30:12,599 --> 01:30:14,549
office visit and like well you have to

2193
01:30:14,549 --> 01:30:15,659
sign this paper but you have to bring

2194
01:30:15,659 --> 01:30:17,219
this form but you can't be a copy it's

2195
01:30:17,219 --> 01:30:19,109
got to be a stamp it's good all that

2196
01:30:19,109 --> 01:30:23,039
good just gone because you can automate

2197
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:27,239
this stuff and it's trustworthy so the

2198
01:30:27,239 --> 01:30:31,229
life of the cow right let's say there's

2199
01:30:31,229 --> 01:30:35,069
no central authority in your your state

2200
01:30:35,069 --> 01:30:36,959
or you don't trust the federal one or

2201
01:30:36,959 --> 01:30:38,549
you're trying to go between two

2202
01:30:38,549 --> 01:30:39,809
countries they don't have any agreement

2203
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:43,079
with each other you can put a tag on a

2204
01:30:43,079 --> 01:30:44,250
cow when it

2205
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:48,330
it comes into this world and you put a

2206
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:51,210
QR code on it and and scan it and you

2207
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:52,740
scan your ID and you say this cow

2208
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,870
belongs to me and then you take it to

2209
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:57,000
the veterinarian and you have you scan

2210
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,460
the cow and your ID and the veterinarian

2211
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:03,030
and you get a record that it went there

2212
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:04,380
all right that gets put into the

2213
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:06,510
blockchain and then I sell it to

2214
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,280
somebody else so I scan my ID in the

2215
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:10,410
count and the person that I sold it to

2216
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:12,360
and they transferred me the money and

2217
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:13,800
they can show that I sold it on this

2218
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,760
date and they take it to another

2219
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,860
veterinarian and they can take it to an

2220
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,090
auction and it could be transferred to

2221
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:20,070
another person and then it could be

2222
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:22,080
brought to a slaughterhouse and put into

2223
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,370
little packages and sold in a

2224
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:25,650
supermarket and I can take out my phone

2225
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:29,040
and scan a QR code on that sirloin and

2226
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,770
it'll tell me all that stuff like you

2227
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:34,020
could build that and you wouldn't need

2228
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,490
any infrastructure you wouldn't need any

2229
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:39,060
permission from anybody to build it you

2230
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,980
could just build it you could just build

2231
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:44,100
the mobile app and the app that runs on

2232
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,320
the veterinarian's computer that keeps

2233
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,970
synchronizing all the blockchain state

2234
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:51,420
and the auction house and you would have

2235
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:54,390
this amazing tracking ability with

2236
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:55,800
absolute trust between all the

2237
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,810
participants and you don't need anyone

2238
01:31:57,810 --> 01:32:00,900
to give you permission to do that so

2239
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:02,190
what if it's not a cow what if it's a

2240
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:05,670
car a car is significantly smarter than

2241
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:10,620
a cow now how now right

2242
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:14,910
did not mean to do that Wow anyway a car

2243
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:16,530
could be integrated with the blockchain

2244
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:18,870
- so I could rent the car from my friend

2245
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:21,450
and send him a payment and his phone can

2246
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:23,850
send a command to the car to unlock

2247
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:27,150
itself and then my NFC radio on my phone

2248
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:30,840
could start the car and I don't need any

2249
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,400
permission to build any of that either I

2250
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,110
mean you need a can bus integration and

2251
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:37,020
you need a mobile app and you could the

2252
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:38,700
payment gateway is there payments are

2253
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,920
solved transferring the temporary

2254
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,590
ownership or possession of the car is

2255
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:45,510
solved you could even tie in an

2256
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:47,250
insurance contract that's activated

2257
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,720
because they know that I'm gonna own the

2258
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,840
car for 72 hours and they could activate

2259
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,370
an insurance contract and what I've done

2260
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:55,440
you could have like prorated insurance

2261
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,020
for the you know 14 and a half hours

2262
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:59,610
that you own the car you could do all

2263
01:32:59,610 --> 01:33:00,630
sorts of things like that

2264
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:04,980
so yeah unregulated going to take a

2265
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:07,860
while to get that clarified as to how

2266
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,720
much of this is possible and how much

2267
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:15,420
isn't but I think what is the the

2268
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:18,480
quickest way to say it is tcp/ip is a

2269
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,400
communication protocol you can transfer

2270
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,770
information back and forth but

2271
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:26,150
blockchain is a value exchange protocol

2272
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:29,490
so if I have in the same way like if I

2273
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:32,460
pull out for $1 bills I can only give

2274
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:34,770
them to four people but if I have like a

2275
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:36,180
digital picture I can give it to a bunch

2276
01:33:36,180 --> 01:33:37,980
of people and I could say like well I

2277
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:40,350
only sold it four times the digital

2278
01:33:40,350 --> 01:33:42,360
picture I get I own only four people in

2279
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,580
the world on this digital picture well

2280
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:45,690
do they I mean they could just make

2281
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:47,880
copies of it they this is that there's

2282
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,740
no way to say that you can't increase

2283
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:51,330
the value of your digital photograph

2284
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:53,100
because you just promised that you only

2285
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,770
sold it a few times but with blockchain

2286
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:57,510
you could show that you only sold it

2287
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:59,790
that many times and so it gives value to

2288
01:33:59,790 --> 01:34:01,680
the things that you're sending back and

2289
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:07,490
forth utility tokens this is kind of

2290
01:34:07,490 --> 01:34:13,440
where I'm interested in I think I think

2291
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,820
you'll kind of see the utility of them

2292
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:18,090
haha the utility namecoin this is

2293
01:34:18,090 --> 01:34:20,190
decentralized dns it's an implementation

2294
01:34:20,190 --> 01:34:22,659
of DNS that's completely decentralized

2295
01:34:22,659 --> 01:34:25,120
so nobody can take over nobody can put

2296
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,540
false information it's a trusted DNS

2297
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:30,010
that's distributed all over the world

2298
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:32,820
and can be relied upon to resolve names

2299
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:36,429
pretty cool this has got the best name

2300
01:34:36,429 --> 01:34:38,230
of the group the interplanetary file

2301
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:40,989
system that's a decentralized file

2302
01:34:40,989 --> 01:34:44,320
storage or contact delivery network so I

2303
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,230
don't I don't have to trust anyone that

2304
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:49,090
I send this file up there and no one's

2305
01:34:49,090 --> 01:34:51,190
gonna manipulate it or prevent access to

2306
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:53,880
it or somehow restrict it or it's

2307
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:57,310
decentralized trusted it's tough to

2308
01:34:57,310 --> 01:34:58,780
scale because can you imagine running

2309
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:01,540
YouTube on a decentralized blockchain

2310
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:04,030
right now pretty impossible everyone

2311
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:06,100
would have to have every copy or a copy

2312
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,230
of every video ever uploaded to YouTube

2313
01:35:08,230 --> 01:35:13,380
this not gonna happen this year anyway

2314
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,520
enum this is a phone think normally I

2315
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,719
talk about phone stuff

2316
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,880
I let do a lot of cell phone stuff so

2317
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,659
enum is a way to resolve a DNS name to a

2318
01:35:22,659 --> 01:35:24,850
telephone number or a telephone number

2319
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:27,370
to a DNS name so this is a decentralized

2320
01:35:27,370 --> 01:35:30,610
enum Edom failed because there was no

2321
01:35:30,610 --> 01:35:32,469
central authority there was no one in

2322
01:35:32,469 --> 01:35:33,670
the world that could say this phone

2323
01:35:33,670 --> 01:35:37,290
number maps to this DNS address it was -

2324
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:40,120
you had to trust too many people or you

2325
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,670
had to pay for it or whatever it was it

2326
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:45,190
was fundamentally flawed but this is

2327
01:35:45,190 --> 01:35:47,440
this fixes it it's decentralized enum

2328
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,639
this is exactly what they wanted in the

2329
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:52,330
first place the one that I'm working on

2330
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:56,530
now is decentralized VPN it's faster

2331
01:35:56,530 --> 01:35:57,850
than tor all right because you're not

2332
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:59,020
going through a bunch of nodes it's just

2333
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:00,929
simple VPN but it's peer-to-peer and

2334
01:36:00,929 --> 01:36:03,940
then there's an incentive to run the

2335
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:05,920
exit node because you'll get paid you'll

2336
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,810
get paid in these tokens for running the

2337
01:36:07,810 --> 01:36:09,520
exit node you can also control the

2338
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,840
traffic that goes through the exit node

2339
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,090
have a little more granular control and

2340
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:15,489
then this is the cool part to me if you

2341
01:36:15,489 --> 01:36:17,739
can't afford VPN service well you can

2342
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:19,239
fire up a computer in the corner and

2343
01:36:19,239 --> 01:36:21,850
have it start mining the coins for this

2344
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:24,280
service and then once you have a few you

2345
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,570
can establish a connection to somebody

2346
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:28,030
else running a wallet running the daemon

2347
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:30,489
and pay them to exit through the air

2348
01:36:30,489 --> 01:36:33,070
connection so you can earn VPN

2349
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:35,650
connectivity by just mining

2350
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:40,870
coins and spending it on the network I'm

2351
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:42,159
gonna go back to drawing horses now

2352
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:44,260
because this is kind of an important

2353
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,800
point this proof of work algorithm

2354
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,080
there's a bunch of them and the one

2355
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,230
that's chosen for Manero and intense

2356
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:56,560
coin is a fork of monaro is kryptonite

2357
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,429
whatever it's egalitarian mining meaning

2358
01:36:59,429 --> 01:37:01,989
when you're drawing these horses when

2359
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:03,580
you're mining and solving mathematical

2360
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,530
puzzles you're not drawing horses

2361
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:07,960
solving math problems

2362
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:11,650
that's called it usually its measured in

2363
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:13,840
hash power how many hashes of a specific

2364
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,969
problem can you perform in a second and

2365
01:37:15,969 --> 01:37:17,860
the network stops if you don't have any

2366
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:18,600
hash power

2367
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:20,800
so people are incentivized and they're

2368
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,320
paid to provide it you can do these

2369
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,780
calculations on the CPU on a GPU or on

2370
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:28,600
an ASIC ASIC is a application-specific

2371
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,340
integrated circuit so it's a

2372
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:33,100
custom-built device that just does these

2373
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:35,320
hashes so what you're talking about

2374
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,810
in order of magnitude is CPU maybe you

2375
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:40,449
can do hundreds of hashes a second GPU

2376
01:37:40,449 --> 01:37:42,940
maybe thousands tens of thousands ASIC

2377
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,429
might be hundreds of millions I mean

2378
01:37:45,429 --> 01:37:47,679
it's designed to just do that it's not a

2379
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,090
general-purpose computer it's designed

2380
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:51,909
just do this so there's been a lot of

2381
01:37:51,909 --> 01:37:56,710
work on making these algorithms ASIC

2382
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:59,949
resistant so there's the sha-256 was

2383
01:37:59,949 --> 01:38:02,830
Bitcoin not ASIC resistant at all very

2384
01:38:02,830 --> 01:38:06,280
easy to program into device script made

2385
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,750
it so that it required too much memory

2386
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:09,100
so you should probably use at least a

2387
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:11,590
GPU we can't use Nasik eath hashes

2388
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:15,370
another memory it really wants to use a

2389
01:38:15,370 --> 01:38:16,030
lot of memory

2390
01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:17,949
kryptonite that's the one that uses a

2391
01:38:17,949 --> 01:38:21,250
whole bunch of like low-level CPU cache

2392
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:23,440
so if you don't have a bunch of CPU

2393
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,330
cache it's gonna run really slow so it

2394
01:38:25,330 --> 01:38:27,130
doesn't run fast on GPUs either it

2395
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:29,170
doesn't run fast on Asics now they're

2396
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:31,690
working on Asics

2397
01:38:31,690 --> 01:38:35,020
and the problem with well why don't you

2398
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:36,400
want people to run a six and why don't

2399
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,510
you want them to earn more money on your

2400
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:40,420
network because they can gang up and do

2401
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,670
like a 51% attack this whole thing

2402
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:44,350
depends on consensus of the majority of

2403
01:38:44,350 --> 01:38:46,389
the nodes so if the majority of the hash

2404
01:38:46,389 --> 01:38:48,580
power is calculating the answers to

2405
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:51,670
problems is lying to you the whole

2406
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:55,870
network breaks because I can say well he

2407
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:57,460
transferred all of his bitcoins to me

2408
01:38:57,460 --> 01:38:59,950
look most of the network thinks he did

2409
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:01,540
and then everyone says no I guess so I

2410
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:03,280
guess he I guess he did and then that

2411
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,720
becomes part of the blockchain and it's

2412
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:08,110
permanent you can't delete it so there's

2413
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:10,210
a lot of work trying to work trying to

2414
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:12,310
find a sakra sistent proof of work

2415
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:14,710
algorithms something that runs the same

2416
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:17,460
speed on a CPU as a GPU as an ASIC and

2417
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:20,770
that lets people participate in the

2418
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:22,660
network which distributes the hash power

2419
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:26,350
over a wider chunk of the participants

2420
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:29,170
that was the original idea of Bitcoin in

2421
01:39:29,170 --> 01:39:31,090
the original white paper which by the

2422
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:33,040
way read it it's probably one of the

2423
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,100
most concise explanations of how

2424
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,510
blockchain or how a new technology could

2425
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:41,050
work is eight pages long I mean it's it

2426
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:42,910
describes the entire thing in less than

2427
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:45,190
a dozen pages it's incredible but the

2428
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:47,620
original idea was that every node can

2429
01:39:47,620 --> 01:39:51,010
participate and one CPU means one vote

2430
01:39:51,010 --> 01:39:53,830
so it wasn't designed that one person

2431
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:55,450
could have a million votes it was

2432
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:57,370
designed that one CPU participating the

2433
01:39:57,370 --> 01:40:01,900
network has a vote and that's it so now

2434
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,570
this isn't hype this is like I'll put on

2435
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:07,420
big rose-colored glasses and talk about

2436
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,700
how wonderful everything is is this how

2437
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,280
the web should maybe be like maybe it

2438
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:13,240
should have been like this from the

2439
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:16,950
beginning web 1.0 everything was static

2440
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:19,240
you made your geo cities page about your

2441
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:21,220
favorite band and you had your 19

2442
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,890
animated gifs going back and forth and

2443
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:25,420
it was static and you went to fan sites

2444
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:26,440
and you're like that's cool that guy

2445
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:30,130
really likes that band and then web 2.0

2446
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,750
had JavaScript so you could program some

2447
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:34,240
stuff right and Ajax happened and all of

2448
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,860
a sudden like the flickr uploader never

2449
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:38,350
changed the page and Wow

2450
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:39,580
you could do all this stuff without the

2451
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:42,700
page reloading and it was very

2452
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:46,270
interactive but somebody had to provide

2453
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:47,800
all the infrastructure for that so you

2454
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,720
ended up with a bunch of walled gardens

2455
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:52,150
so you didn't have like geo cities with

2456
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:56,050
all you know everyone's little personal

2457
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,870
space that everyone is on Facebook and

2458
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:00,310
you can't see what they're doing unless

2459
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:02,190
you're on Facebook and all your

2460
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:05,110
content belongs to Facebook and it's

2461
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:06,700
only available on Facebook and if you

2462
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:08,800
share a post you can only share it to

2463
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,270
the people that they let you share it

2464
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:11,530
with and if you want to share it to more

2465
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:12,670
people you have to pay them more money

2466
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,070
so that more people see your posts it's

2467
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:17,650
horrible so they provide the

2468
01:41:17,650 --> 01:41:19,420
infrastructure which means they extract

2469
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:22,000
value from your personal data to pay for

2470
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,210
the infrastructure if you didn't know

2471
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:27,310
that I mean that's what they do they

2472
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:29,500
that's otherwise it wouldn't be free

2473
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,870
you're the product they take all your

2474
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:33,010
information everything that you do and

2475
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:34,360
they study in the cell to add companies

2476
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:36,000
and they try and get you to buy stuff

2477
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,220
that's it so what if there wasn't any

2478
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:43,300
need for a entity a company a publicly

2479
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:46,360
traded money maker to own the

2480
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:47,440
infrastructure what if it was

2481
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:49,140
decentralized what if it ran on

2482
01:41:49,140 --> 01:41:52,450
everybody's computer all the time that

2483
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:54,100
would be pretty cool and then you would

2484
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:56,290
control your information alright you

2485
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:57,280
could choose how you want it to

2486
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,990
participate now how anonymous you want

2487
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:02,200
it to be it'd be pretty cool there's a

2488
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,910
couple that have already started working

2489
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:05,100
on it

2490
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:09,100
steam accom is like medium calm but

2491
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:11,170
you're paid for content and comments so

2492
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:12,580
if you write good comments a good

2493
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:15,070
content people can upload you an upvote

2494
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:18,250
automatically transfers of micro sliver

2495
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:21,340
of coin to your account and if you write

2496
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:22,930
intelligent comments on other people's

2497
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:23,350
posts

2498
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:25,480
you also get transferred a little bit of

2499
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:30,580
a coin for doing that earn calm it's

2500
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:31,870
like LinkedIn but you're paid to be

2501
01:42:31,870 --> 01:42:34,810
contacted like what if LinkedIn would

2502
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:37,780
make it possible for headhunters to pay

2503
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:39,820
me five dollars if they wanted to send

2504
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:42,370
me an email right now they pay LinkedIn

2505
01:42:42,370 --> 01:42:45,880
for the ability to send me email well

2506
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:48,940
that's crap I mean you literally pay for

2507
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,770
in mail you pay for a subscription for

2508
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:52,480
to be a pro user and a headhunter and

2509
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:55,210
then LinkedIn gets paid every time I'm

2510
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,190
bugged by a stranger who wants to talk

2511
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:00,130
to me that I don't know this inverts it

2512
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:02,620
so that I would get paid five bucks if

2513
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:06,070
you want to talk to me and it's almost

2514
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:08,470
like they predicted it this is an unused

2515
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:13,150
HTTP error code from 1999 who was never

2516
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:15,489
implemented payment required for

2517
01:43:15,489 --> 01:43:19,119
- 404 everyone knows right now found

2518
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:22,539
same one like we found the content but

2519
01:43:22,539 --> 01:43:26,110
you didn't pay us for Oh - now it's

2520
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:28,449
possible before it was impossible to do

2521
01:43:28,449 --> 01:43:31,409
now you could you can implement a 402

2522
01:43:31,409 --> 01:43:32,590
anyway

2523
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:36,519
super early days if there's any problem

2524
01:43:36,519 --> 01:43:37,179
with it right now

2525
01:43:37,179 --> 01:43:39,789
it might get solved I would guess it

2526
01:43:39,789 --> 01:43:41,530
gets solved it's a very very beginning

2527
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:42,730
of everything

2528
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:44,619
there's even a new one called hash graph

2529
01:43:44,619 --> 01:43:47,289
it's not blockchain it's orders and

2530
01:43:47,289 --> 01:43:49,570
orders and orders of magnitude faster

2531
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:52,150
it doesn't require any proof of work but

2532
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,710
its patented and owned by a private

2533
01:43:53,710 --> 01:43:54,789
company because they're smart and they

2534
01:43:54,789 --> 01:43:58,019
want to make money yeah I mean surprise

2535
01:43:58,019 --> 01:44:01,559
but what could that be if it's not

2536
01:44:01,559 --> 01:44:03,849
fifteen hundred transactions per second

2537
01:44:03,849 --> 01:44:06,039
but like a quarter million transactions

2538
01:44:06,039 --> 01:44:07,889
per second and it doesn't require

2539
01:44:07,889 --> 01:44:10,090
electricity to be used needlessly

2540
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:13,300
calculating the answers to pointless

2541
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:15,550
mathematical puzzles like if that whole

2542
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:18,099
part could be removed what would that

2543
01:44:18,099 --> 01:44:19,630
mean that would really change everything

2544
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:22,719
so really early who knows what's gonna

2545
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:25,030
happen blockchain might not be I mean it

2546
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:26,110
might be talking about blockchain now

2547
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:27,639
like it's amazing and then in ten years

2548
01:44:27,639 --> 01:44:30,909
like that was pretty naive first shot at

2549
01:44:30,909 --> 01:44:33,820
this idea but it proved the point so

2550
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:36,940
anyway that's all I have if you have

2551
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:40,599
questions please ask me and I will try

2552
01:44:40,599 --> 01:44:42,929
my best

2553
01:44:47,359 --> 01:44:49,969
not for you no you don't have to pay

2554
01:44:49,969 --> 01:44:54,939
five bucks to talk to me three it's fine

2555
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:05,480
change

2556
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:12,160
yeah the question is is there any

2557
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,400
changes coming up to computing

2558
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,420
technology in general that would render

2559
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:20,710
this like useless or make it make it

2560
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:24,580
easy to count yet well you're you're

2561
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:26,220
always betting against public key

2562
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:29,770
cryptography and there's a significant

2563
01:45:29,770 --> 01:45:32,680
motivation to find a loophole in public

2564
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,390
key right if you found the loophole to

2565
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:36,970
that that's I think the total

2566
01:45:36,970 --> 01:45:39,610
cryptocurrency market cap is 350 billion

2567
01:45:39,610 --> 01:45:41,950
all of them together so that's

2568
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:43,330
significant motivation every bank

2569
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:45,880
transfer is done in you know PK every

2570
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:48,160
interaction with a website is public

2571
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:51,520
private Keys the one question is quantum

2572
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,920
which I am not qualified to talk about

2573
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:57,100
at all but there is research going into

2574
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:59,830
being quantum resistant because a

2575
01:45:59,830 --> 01:46:01,990
significantly powered quantum computer

2576
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:04,800
could calculate the answer to the

2577
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,840
fundamental math problems behind public

2578
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,710
key private key infrastructure so that's

2579
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:13,390
the only one that's kind of on the radar

2580
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:16,440
is like quantum computing

2581
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:28,260
how does yeah how does supply chain

2582
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:30,300
management match up with scalability it

2583
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,340
depends on your granularity of your

2584
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:34,770
supply chain if you're measuring every

2585
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:40,860
single you know piece of electronics on

2586
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:43,140
a board on a PCB or something if you're

2587
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:45,660
scanning those at the speed that they're

2588
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:49,050
being soldered on to the PCB they might

2589
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:54,510
get tough but if you account for the

2590
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:56,970
fact that it's not scalable at that

2591
01:46:56,970 --> 01:47:00,170
level then it does solve the problem

2592
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:03,570
between like a manufacturer and China a

2593
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:07,770
shipping company in the Middle East and

2594
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:12,210
a sales company in Europe and Returns

2595
01:47:12,210 --> 01:47:13,680
Department in the United States or

2596
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:21,270
something yeah yep there there was a it

2597
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:23,310
verified like where something came from

2598
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:26,970
verifying it that food is actually been

2599
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:30,360
farmed responsibly yeah at some level if

2600
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:34,050
it's not a computer program you're

2601
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:36,060
talking to you have to trust the

2602
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:39,090
interaction between the person inputting

2603
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:41,760
the data and and like the farm

2604
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,010
that's reporting that it's organic there

2605
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:45,390
still has to be like an on-the-ground

2606
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:48,860
truth check to see if it if it is or not

2607
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:51,840
but that's a problem with everything

2608
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,960
it's a general problem but as far as

2609
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,200
once you've established that then

2610
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:59,760
proving that this company scanned this

2611
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,890
box of bananas and sent it to this other

2612
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:05,010
shipping agency that's that's solved

2613
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:08,790
without requiring anybody to or without

2614
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:10,410
demanding any trust from any of those

2615
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:12,630
companies involved after it's been put

2616
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:15,090
in the box and sealed then after that

2617
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:18,270
your trust is established I think it's

2618
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:19,530
pretty it's pretty interesting there was

2619
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:23,310
a ICO that got made fun of a lot because

2620
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:25,320
it was like banana coin or something

2621
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:28,770
calm and I mean it's just fun to make

2622
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:30,210
fun of it because now they may have made

2623
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:31,590
a bunch of raised a bunch of money based

2624
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:32,700
on the idea that they

2625
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:35,430
delivering bananas in a responsible way

2626
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:38,370
or reliably trackable way something like

2627
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:40,550
that

2628
01:48:43,159 --> 01:48:45,800
okay you can bug me in the hall or

2629
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,929
whatever if you need anything else so

2630
01:48:47,929 --> 01:48:48,850
thank you

2631
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:57,239
[Applause]

2632
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:19,219
oh thanks

2633
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:27,020
was it okay to kiss tired I spent 80% of

2634
01:49:27,020 --> 01:49:28,639
the presentation on the visiting

2635
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:30,949
generals and like how are those tie

2636
01:49:30,949 --> 01:49:32,989
together because I've heard it kind of

2637
01:49:32,989 --> 01:49:35,360
hand waved over a bunch of times it

2638
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,159
relates to this old problem and we

2639
01:49:37,159 --> 01:49:41,409
solved it what

2640
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:54,730
no cuz it's all its own it's all

2641
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:56,590
one-to-one there's more advanced stuff

2642
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:58,449
coming out like if I have your public

2643
01:49:58,449 --> 01:49:59,389
key

2644
01:49:59,389 --> 01:50:01,310
and you have your private key and you

2645
01:50:01,310 --> 01:50:02,840
have my public games I have my private

2646
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,690
right then we can establish trust

2647
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:12,199
directly we don't need to and there's

2648
01:50:12,199 --> 01:50:15,080
also no there's also to making sure I

2649
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,090
didn't leave one of these jabbers behind

2650
01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:19,840
there's also

2651
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:22,580
what I cannot I can use HDMI adapter for

2652
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:25,990
yes I have an it no I don't have that Oh

2653
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:33,680
is there nothing okay that's all I have

2654
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,960
oh I I'm pretty sure there was an email

2655
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:38,180
that said I could use HDMI so that's why

2656
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:41,170
I brought in HDMI No

2657
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:51,410
is there an HDMI cord oh it wasn't

2658
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:53,920
working before

2659
01:52:57,210 --> 01:53:01,300
because we can't get flashed upon there

2660
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:04,380
oh you can't get it on the youtubes room

2661
01:53:04,380 --> 01:53:06,640
can we do the stream with just the video

2662
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:09,700
and without the slides because I kind of

2663
01:53:09,700 --> 01:53:30,420
need to slide so thank you

2664
01:53:58,739 --> 01:54:02,370
it's all started

2665
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:33,590
I guess I should start

2666
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:39,940
I'm gonna go ahead and start presenting

2667
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:42,570
in a second are you guys able to sorry

2668
01:54:42,570 --> 01:54:46,349
if you don't mind Thanks

2669
01:54:46,530 --> 01:54:50,289
okay so thanks for going ahead and

2670
01:54:50,289 --> 01:54:52,750
coming to choose to come see my talk my

2671
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,579
name is Megan Roddy I'll be presenting

2672
01:54:54,579 --> 01:54:57,159
on strengthening your psych ops team by

2673
01:54:57,159 --> 01:54:58,739
leveraging neurodiversity

2674
01:54:58,739 --> 01:55:01,570
start with a bit about myself I'm

2675
01:55:01,570 --> 01:55:04,270
currently a graduate student in at Sam

2676
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:05,920
Houston State University and digital

2677
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,349
forensics I also have a bachelors in

2678
01:55:08,349 --> 01:55:10,329
mathematics and a few certifications in

2679
01:55:10,329 --> 01:55:11,110
cyber security

2680
01:55:11,110 --> 01:55:14,079
I currently work at the Texas Department

2681
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:15,719
of Public Safety as a cyber security

2682
01:55:15,719 --> 01:55:18,099
analyst while doing security consulting

2683
01:55:18,099 --> 01:55:20,860
on the side and I have 21 years

2684
01:55:20,860 --> 01:55:22,780
experience like many speakers at these

2685
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:25,599
conferences my experience is 21 years in

2686
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:29,679
life and most relevant to this talk I

2687
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:33,849
have Asperger's syndrome so for this

2688
01:55:33,849 --> 01:55:36,820
talk I'm going to give an outline of an

2689
01:55:36,820 --> 01:55:39,070
introduction to what my talk is about

2690
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:42,190
and why I give this talk inform you guys

2691
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:46,590
of the problem I identified and why and

2692
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:48,849
basically the reason that I'm giving

2693
01:55:48,849 --> 01:55:50,590
this talk the evidence of other

2694
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:52,150
companies who have already discovered

2695
01:55:52,150 --> 01:55:54,429
what I'm speaking about today and the

2696
01:55:54,429 --> 01:55:58,809
solution and how to adapt to as employer

2697
01:55:58,809 --> 01:56:01,659
or a co-worker of an individual that I'm

2698
01:56:01,659 --> 01:56:05,590
talking about I like to start my talk

2699
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:07,090
with a couple quotes regarding

2700
01:56:07,090 --> 01:56:09,520
neurodiversity the first one is from

2701
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:12,159
Steve Silberman an autism advocate he

2702
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:13,389
says that one way to think of

2703
01:56:13,389 --> 01:56:15,280
neurodiversity is to think in terms of

2704
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,889
human operating systems just because a

2705
01:56:17,889 --> 01:56:19,960
PC is not running Windows doesn't mean

2706
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:20,679
that is broken

2707
01:56:20,679 --> 01:56:25,300
a similar quote talks about sports and

2708
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:29,829
how teams of sports teams they typically

2709
01:56:29,829 --> 01:56:33,909
don't employ don't hire or take on

2710
01:56:33,909 --> 01:56:37,119
athletes just because they're the best

2711
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:39,760
overall they don't need all great

2712
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:42,159
runners are all great kickers they hire

2713
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:44,980
a team with a variety of skills so that

2714
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:48,099
together they can do the best in their

2715
01:56:48,099 --> 01:56:51,100
field the same thing applies and

2716
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:53,650
I'm giving this talk is the idea behind

2717
01:56:53,650 --> 01:56:57,010
what I'm speaking on is that you need a

2718
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:58,990
variety on your team and that means in

2719
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:01,510
bringing in individuals who think

2720
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:04,500
differently than yourselves

2721
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:06,610
so the individuals I'm talking about

2722
01:57:06,610 --> 01:57:09,630
today are a group of highly productive

2723
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:11,920
individuals who have an extreme

2724
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:14,530
attention to detail our logical and

2725
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:16,570
calculated passionate about the work

2726
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:20,440
they do and hyper focused specifically

2727
01:57:20,440 --> 01:57:21,970
I'm talking about individuals with

2728
01:57:21,970 --> 01:57:24,430
high-functioning autism here I like to

2729
01:57:24,430 --> 01:57:26,080
give a disclaimer because there's a lot

2730
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:30,640
of talk in the community about how we

2731
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:32,500
don't want to be generalized into a

2732
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,780
bucket so my talk is not to tell you

2733
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:36,610
that every single individual on the

2734
01:57:36,610 --> 01:57:39,310
autism spectrum should be in security

2735
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:42,340
and nowhere else you may have a second

2736
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:43,930
cousin with autism don't tell him to

2737
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:46,000
drop out of art school because I said

2738
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,700
that he's good at security so this is

2739
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:51,820
just it's a a group a subgroup of

2740
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:53,260
high-functioning autistic who are

2741
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:54,730
interested in the field and good at

2742
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:57,520
these skills and don't I'm speaking

2743
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,230
about high-functioning autism I titled

2744
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:01,810
my talk neurodiversity and not autism

2745
01:58:01,810 --> 01:58:05,860
because these same themes apply to what

2746
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:07,390
I'm talking about with neuro diversity

2747
01:58:07,390 --> 01:58:09,550
in general is that we need to be

2748
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:11,860
accepting and bringing these individuals

2749
01:58:11,860 --> 01:58:14,590
into the field whether it's autism

2750
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:17,770
bipolar disorder depression anxiety it

2751
01:58:17,770 --> 01:58:19,750
all applies in to subversive fiying your

2752
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:23,230
team so the problem I'm approaching with

2753
01:58:23,230 --> 01:58:24,640
this talk is that there's a high

2754
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,440
unemployment rate among high-functioning

2755
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:29,620
autism autistics despite the fact that

2756
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:33,280
only under 5% of individuals on the

2757
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,800
spectrum are considered to be mentally

2758
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:37,120
disabled at the point where they are

2759
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:39,670
unable to hold a full-time job or any

2760
01:58:39,670 --> 01:58:41,890
job at all there's still a high

2761
01:58:41,890 --> 01:58:44,620
unemployment rate ninety-five percent of

2762
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:47,170
individuals with autism are either of

2763
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:49,000
average intelligence or above average

2764
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,790
intelligence and so are fully capable of

2765
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:54,760
holding a job so why is are they aren't

2766
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:56,920
or why are they not employed it comes

2767
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,360
down to the social and behavioral

2768
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,430
disabilities associated with

2769
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:03,220
high-functioning autism basically we're

2770
01:59:03,220 --> 01:59:04,250
weird

2771
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:08,060
I like to go over a few of the things

2772
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:10,700
that I personally experience and that

2773
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:12,080
you may see other individuals with

2774
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:14,840
high-functioning autism experience first

2775
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:17,720
is I typically talk at a very loud

2776
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:20,450
volume even in personal conversations

2777
01:59:20,450 --> 01:59:24,020
this tends to annoy people it frustrates

2778
01:59:24,020 --> 01:59:25,220
people especially when they're trying to

2779
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:27,230
work on something and they can hear me

2780
01:59:27,230 --> 01:59:29,240
from across the room I'm told to be

2781
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:31,430
quiet and to use my indoor voice

2782
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:32,990
as you would tell your five-year-old

2783
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:35,810
child it's frustrating I don't realize I

2784
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:38,300
do it a lot of the time but I understand

2785
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:39,950
how it can frustrate people especially

2786
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:44,930
after they pointed out I also am very

2787
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:47,540
blunt when I speak to people if I

2788
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:49,910
believe something is the truth and it is

2789
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:52,580
solid fact I will tell you I actually

2790
01:59:52,580 --> 01:59:54,050
have a new example I used to give a

2791
01:59:54,050 --> 01:59:57,560
different one but this weekend before I

2792
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:00,140
came into town my fiancee was sick I

2793
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:01,640
think he has like bronchitis or

2794
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:03,590
something but he's stubborn and won't go

2795
02:00:03,590 --> 02:00:06,980
to a doctor and so he was he saw me the

2796
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:08,600
other day we're having dinner and he was

2797
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:10,880
like are you okay because I guess I was

2798
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:13,580
lucky upset I said that coffee is really

2799
02:00:13,580 --> 02:00:15,860
starting to annoy me so I'm just gonna

2800
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:18,770
go away so I'm very direct with what I

2801
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:20,510
say I'll say things that offend you like

2802
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:22,430
because he probably was not happy I was

2803
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:24,530
telling him his sickness was a nuisance

2804
02:00:24,530 --> 02:00:25,040
to me

2805
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,530
but typically I don't think about what I

2806
02:00:27,530 --> 02:00:30,530
say and how people will interpret that

2807
02:00:30,530 --> 02:00:34,700
so that can turn people off and really I

2808
02:00:34,700 --> 02:00:36,650
don't understand that what I'm saying is

2809
02:00:36,650 --> 02:00:39,440
inappropriate and the context and that

2810
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:43,030
some things are to be kept to yourself

2811
02:00:43,090 --> 02:00:46,880
this is a picture that shows kind of one

2812
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:48,590
of those weird behaviors I'm talking

2813
02:00:48,590 --> 02:00:51,530
about this is a picture of the jeans I

2814
02:00:51,530 --> 02:00:54,230
own they are all the same brand same

2815
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:58,490
size same style same color I am very

2816
02:00:58,490 --> 02:01:01,250
hyper sensitive to certain materials and

2817
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:03,260
fabric and I don't like shopping it

2818
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:05,090
stresses me out so I found a pair of

2819
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:07,610
jeans I like and I bought as many pairs

2820
02:01:07,610 --> 02:01:09,920
as I could because it would be a

2821
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:11,930
disaster if one pair was ruined and all

2822
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:14,240
of a sudden I had to go on the journey

2823
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:16,239
of finding a pair of jeans

2824
02:01:16,239 --> 02:01:18,430
so this is that kind of weird behavior

2825
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:20,800
where you're gonna think I'm strange and

2826
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:23,320
you know just as human human nature you

2827
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:26,050
now kind of don't wanna so she ate with

2828
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:29,160
me so this also points out a

2829
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:31,060
characteristic from individuals with

2830
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:34,080
autism is that there's a lot of times

2831
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,010
hypersensitivities associated you'll

2832
02:01:36,010 --> 02:01:37,360
find a lot of individuals who

2833
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:39,370
fluorescent lights make it difficult for

2834
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:41,680
them to pay attention at work or in

2835
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:43,390
general fluorescent flights are

2836
02:01:43,390 --> 02:01:46,840
basically painful fabrics tastes any

2837
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:50,560
sort of sensory processing can be very

2838
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,210
much intensified and that's one of the

2839
02:01:52,210 --> 02:01:54,219
things that makes it difficult to work

2840
02:01:54,219 --> 02:01:58,180
or it results in us experience abating

2841
02:01:58,180 --> 02:02:02,200
strange behaviors despite these things

2842
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:03,670
there are companies who have been able

2843
02:02:03,670 --> 02:02:06,160
to look past these social and behavioral

2844
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:08,760
disabilities and realize that

2845
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:11,200
individuals with autism provide

2846
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:14,890
invaluable skills to the industry I'll

2847
02:02:14,890 --> 02:02:16,989
start off with some statistics an

2848
02:02:16,989 --> 02:02:18,880
overview of companies employers in

2849
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,070
Australia who have employees on the

2850
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:23,110
autism spectrum and the overall

2851
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:25,000
consensus was that these individuals

2852
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,219
were benefitting their team they had

2853
02:02:27,219 --> 02:02:29,590
above average performance and exhibited

2854
02:02:29,590 --> 02:02:31,060
so the characteristics I mentioned

2855
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:32,920
before the attention to detail the

2856
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:35,880
quality and the work ethic and passion

2857
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:38,200
they brought in different skills that

2858
02:02:38,200 --> 02:02:40,390
they found that neurotypical individuals

2859
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:44,280
did not have and they reported positive

2860
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:46,960
adaptations in the work culture they the

2861
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,760
individuals were adjusting fine when

2862
02:02:48,760 --> 02:02:50,530
given the right environment to thrive in

2863
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:53,440
and there was no significant additional

2864
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:55,390
cost to the employers that can be a

2865
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:58,210
stereotype is something that's wrongly

2866
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:00,460
assumed is that you're gonna incur all

2867
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:02,610
these costs for for all these

2868
02:03:02,610 --> 02:03:05,020
adaptations and the things that you have

2869
02:03:05,020 --> 02:03:07,180
to do to follow ATA laws and all that

2870
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:09,160
but they found that it's not really true

2871
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,719
especially in the case of the autism

2872
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:11,700
spectrum

2873
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:14,170
so the first company I typically bring

2874
02:03:14,170 --> 02:03:16,210
up is actually a collective of companies

2875
02:03:16,210 --> 02:03:19,960
but if specifically si P I like their

2876
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,730
logic behind why they started their

2877
02:03:21,730 --> 02:03:24,489
autism at work program they looked at

2878
02:03:24,489 --> 02:03:27,100
the statistics that 1% of the world was

2879
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:28,390
on the autism spectrum

2880
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:31,300
so in their minds if 1% of the world was

2881
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:33,250
on the autism spectrum then why

2882
02:03:33,250 --> 02:03:35,020
shouldn't 1 percent of their workforce

2883
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:37,870
be on the spectrum they saw so they

2884
02:03:37,870 --> 02:03:41,490
sought out to buy 20/20 have a matching

2885
02:03:41,490 --> 02:03:44,290
population of autistic individuals at

2886
02:03:44,290 --> 02:03:47,050
their company as they do in the world

2887
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:49,390
and so they started their autism at work

2888
02:03:49,390 --> 02:03:52,420
program behind them came Microsoft New

2889
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:55,000
Relic HP and many more technical

2890
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,010
programs that have technical companies

2891
02:03:57,010 --> 02:03:59,260
that have these programs these programs

2892
02:03:59,260 --> 02:04:02,740
seeks to help the individuals just to

2893
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:05,260
working a full time job along with

2894
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:08,260
helping the managers and co-workers who

2895
02:04:08,260 --> 02:04:09,820
have not been in a situation where

2896
02:04:09,820 --> 02:04:12,940
they've had to regularly interact with

2897
02:04:12,940 --> 02:04:15,220
individuals with autism learn how to

2898
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:19,270
properly do that this is one of my

2899
02:04:19,270 --> 02:04:21,280
favorite examples is the Israeli army

2900
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:26,200
they have laws in their country that any

2901
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:29,170
when you turn 18 you must serve a few

2902
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:31,090
years in the military the Israeli army

2903
02:04:31,090 --> 02:04:33,280
and the Israeli army is known as a

2904
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:36,400
strong military force and what was

2905
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,050
happening was there was many

2906
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:39,700
high-functioning autistic individuals

2907
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:42,250
who would turn 18 and as all their peers

2908
02:04:42,250 --> 02:04:44,560
were going off to join the military they

2909
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,180
were getting letters exempting them from

2910
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:48,130
service and saying they can stay home

2911
02:04:48,130 --> 02:04:49,570
and not worry about it

2912
02:04:49,570 --> 02:04:52,180
but the things these individuals wanted

2913
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:53,860
to fit in with their peers they wanted

2914
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,510
to serve their country as many of their

2915
02:04:55,510 --> 02:04:58,360
peers we're doing out of high school so

2916
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:00,880
seeing that there were were a pool of

2917
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,940
people who did have the mental

2918
02:05:03,940 --> 02:05:08,050
capability to work full-time they

2919
02:05:08,050 --> 02:05:10,330
decided to start an individual unit

2920
02:05:10,330 --> 02:05:12,130
called the visual intelligence division

2921
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:16,060
or unit 9900 in which these individuals

2922
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:18,370
spend their entire day sitting in front

2923
02:05:18,370 --> 02:05:20,470
of computer monitors and comparing

2924
02:05:20,470 --> 02:05:22,930
satellite images over time they do this

2925
02:05:22,930 --> 02:05:24,900
to help the ground forces identify

2926
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:27,910
potential threats that have emerged in

2927
02:05:27,910 --> 02:05:30,220
the environments for example maybe there

2928
02:05:30,220 --> 02:05:33,160
was nothing on the road the road was

2929
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:35,140
clear and now there's some weird mound

2930
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:37,240
over in the corner and they can notify

2931
02:05:37,240 --> 02:05:39,700
to watch out for IEDs or other

2932
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:41,050
explosives and boo

2933
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:42,630
traps that may have been planning

2934
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:45,670
additional things military forces moving

2935
02:05:45,670 --> 02:05:47,710
that are typically stealthily these

2936
02:05:47,710 --> 02:05:49,900
individuals were able to go long periods

2937
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:51,550
of time they also have an extreme

2938
02:05:51,550 --> 02:05:53,500
tension to detail so they would notice

2939
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:57,989
small changes that their neurotypical

2940
02:05:57,989 --> 02:06:00,159
neurotypical employees typically would

2941
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:03,670
not the best thing that came out of this

2942
02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:06,429
is that the commanders of this division

2943
02:06:06,429 --> 02:06:08,739
decided that they didn't want to fully

2944
02:06:08,739 --> 02:06:11,079
segregate they and they didn't need to

2945
02:06:11,079 --> 02:06:12,880
fully segregate the autistic community

2946
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:15,790
and realize that all it took was a

2947
02:06:15,790 --> 02:06:17,440
little bit of learning about how these

2948
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:21,460
individuals needed to be led and they

2949
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:24,820
were able to move them into the general

2950
02:06:24,820 --> 02:06:26,800
population of military forces and put

2951
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:30,909
them in typical military roles so it was

2952
02:06:30,909 --> 02:06:32,260
a learning experience for them at first

2953
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:33,849
they thought that this group of

2954
02:06:33,849 --> 02:06:35,559
individuals would be so different as so

2955
02:06:35,559 --> 02:06:37,570
difficult to manage that they needed to

2956
02:06:37,570 --> 02:06:39,520
segregate them but when they realized

2957
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:41,500
there's individuals wanting to to work

2958
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:43,960
in other roles and that it really wasn't

2959
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:45,400
that hard to manage them in this place

2960
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:47,559
they they decided to make the change and

2961
02:06:47,559 --> 02:06:51,849
it's proved well for them lastly is

2962
02:06:51,849 --> 02:06:54,309
again several companies in a group of

2963
02:06:54,309 --> 02:06:57,699
companies that employ autistic

2964
02:06:57,699 --> 02:07:01,059
individuals specifically expertise is a

2965
02:07:01,059 --> 02:07:02,949
French and Canadian company that

2966
02:07:02,949 --> 02:07:06,630
provides big data security and

2967
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:09,369
programming services to various other

2968
02:07:09,369 --> 02:07:12,790
companies they say that from for a

2969
02:07:12,790 --> 02:07:14,440
different and innovative vision of IT

2970
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:17,139
beyond the traditional perimeters with

2971
02:07:17,139 --> 02:07:19,420
very expert profiles and closer to the

2972
02:07:19,420 --> 02:07:22,329
Machine the logic 'no sand calculated

2973
02:07:22,329 --> 02:07:24,070
thinking of individuals with

2974
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:27,159
high-functioning autism is valuable to

2975
02:07:27,159 --> 02:07:30,639
them as they are closer to the machine

2976
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:32,500
in the sense they think more like a

2977
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:34,900
computer than a neurotypical individual

2978
02:07:34,900 --> 02:07:38,020
would they're not the only company that

2979
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:41,050
does this you have specialists turn non

2980
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:43,030
pariah ttle institute specialist guilds

2981
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:45,699
empirical auto con all these companies

2982
02:07:45,699 --> 02:07:48,699
either employ a large workforce of

2983
02:07:48,699 --> 02:07:51,040
contractors with autism to perform IT

2984
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,860
services to other companies or they

2985
02:07:53,860 --> 02:07:54,820
bring in in

2986
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:57,640
with autism train them up in security

2987
02:07:57,640 --> 02:08:00,280
and IT then help find employers who are

2988
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:02,740
willing to work with them and get them

2989
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:05,260
jobs and help those employers learn the

2990
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:07,450
differences in managing neurodiverse

2991
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:13,090
employees JPMorgan is another example of

2992
02:08:13,090 --> 02:08:15,340
a company with an autism at work program

2993
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:18,040
and they said that after three to six

2994
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:20,590
months the autistic workers were doing

2995
02:08:20,590 --> 02:08:23,740
the work that took three years worth of

2996
02:08:23,740 --> 02:08:26,140
training for other individuals and they

2997
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:28,090
did it more productively this is an

2998
02:08:28,090 --> 02:08:29,980
example of quick learning and

2999
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:31,960
productivity at work when they're put in

3000
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:33,640
the right environment they were able to

3001
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:40,840
do the work of multiple employees so

3002
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,400
what do I think the solution is I

3003
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,500
believe the solution when it comes down

3004
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,990
to it is awareness we need to learn to

3005
02:08:46,990 --> 02:08:48,280
not look at individuals with

3006
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:52,180
high-functioning autism as individuals

3007
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:54,460
with a disability though they do have a

3008
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:56,590
disability what we should be focusing on

3009
02:08:56,590 --> 02:08:58,840
as employers is not their weaknesses but

3010
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:00,660
the challenges they bring to the company

3011
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:03,100
just as you would with any neurotypical

3012
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:04,630
employee you're gonna think about what

3013
02:09:04,630 --> 02:09:05,980
their strengths are and how you can

3014
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:07,690
utilize them in the company you should

3015
02:09:07,690 --> 02:09:09,070
do be doing the same thing with

3016
02:09:09,070 --> 02:09:10,660
neurodiverse employees you should be

3017
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,970
thinking about how they're an asset to

3018
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:14,800
your company not all the things they're

3019
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:18,280
not good at and the truth is yes you

3020
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:20,020
will have to adapt to the employee these

3021
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:21,550
employees are different and think

3022
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:23,710
different and behave different than

3023
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:26,350
neurotypical employees but like that

3024
02:09:26,350 --> 02:09:28,000
Australians today said it's not going to

3025
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,830
be a cost to you and really it's pretty

3026
02:09:29,830 --> 02:09:32,440
simple let me give some examples of this

3027
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:36,419
so you can learn how simple it really is

3028
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:40,540
so to start off I want to say forget how

3029
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:42,540
you manage neurotypical employees

3030
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:46,050
because it's not going to be the same I

3031
02:09:46,050 --> 02:09:48,250
provide this example of something I've

3032
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:51,040
actually experienced let's say that at

3033
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:54,400
your company your employee comes to you

3034
02:09:54,400 --> 02:09:57,070
with a great project idea and then they

3035
02:09:57,070 --> 02:09:58,540
want to have it considered they want it

3036
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:01,120
to be a new project implemented well

3037
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:03,070
currently there's a limit on resources

3038
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:04,460
bandwidth

3039
02:10:04,460 --> 02:10:06,590
no it's really not a great time for your

3040
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:08,300
company to take on new projects you need

3041
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:09,950
to get what we have off fireplace oh

3042
02:10:09,950 --> 02:10:12,800
then go to a neurotypical employee you

3043
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:14,960
may say you know that's great

3044
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:25,250
let's reappropriation to process as I

3045
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:28,420
find a less busy to be a ambiguous and

3046
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:31,700
subjective phrasing what I may consider

3047
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:35,030
to be less busy is typically a lot what

3048
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:37,489
would be very busy to iner a typical

3049
02:10:37,489 --> 02:10:39,440
individual because I typically can

3050
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:42,830
handle a lot more work and tasks when

3051
02:10:42,830 --> 02:10:46,580
I'm working so saying less busy I find

3052
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:49,670
it hard to determine what you consider

3053
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:52,130
to be less busy and what a neurotypical

3054
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:55,219
person would so I'm looking for more

3055
02:10:55,219 --> 02:10:58,580
solid deadlines I say remind me about in

3056
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:02,150
a couple weeks for me that means a date

3057
02:11:02,150 --> 02:11:04,280
I can put on my calendar a time to

3058
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:06,670
reappropriation

3059
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,969
two years two months however long you

3060
02:11:16,969 --> 02:11:17,239
need

3061
02:11:17,239 --> 02:11:19,880
but that solid date provides a lot more

3062
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:21,980
comfort than a subjective term in which

3063
02:11:21,980 --> 02:11:26,150
I'm now having to take into account what

3064
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:27,650
you may be thinking which is difficult

3065
02:11:27,650 --> 02:11:31,969
for me so as you can see that was zero

3066
02:11:31,969 --> 02:11:33,830
extra dollars that you're spending per

3067
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:35,750
month in your department and it was a

3068
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:37,670
two word difference there was nothing

3069
02:11:37,670 --> 02:11:41,690
about that that put a strain on you as a

3070
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:43,969
company or as a manager it was just

3071
02:11:43,969 --> 02:11:46,370
simply taking into account that a more

3072
02:11:46,370 --> 02:11:53,030
solid deadline was needed so at a higher

3073
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:53,570
level

3074
02:11:53,570 --> 02:11:56,750
what HFA employees need is structure and

3075
02:11:56,750 --> 02:12:00,290
routine they need clarity on what you

3076
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:02,719
need from them they would appreciate

3077
02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:05,660
patience and understanding knowing that

3078
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:08,180
they don't know all the things they do

3079
02:12:08,180 --> 02:12:12,290
that may be considered strange or

3080
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:14,060
inappropriate to a general environment

3081
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:15,739
understand that when I say something to

3082
02:12:15,739 --> 02:12:16,769
you that offends you

3083
02:12:16,769 --> 02:12:19,260
there's a very good chance that I did

3084
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:21,749
not mean to offend you and I thought I

3085
02:12:21,749 --> 02:12:24,119
was just saying something that was

3086
02:12:24,119 --> 02:12:28,440
obvious or fact and that it wouldn't be

3087
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:32,760
taken incorrectly by making these simple

3088
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:35,579
changes what you will get in return is a

3089
02:12:35,579 --> 02:12:38,099
highly productive employee as JP Morgan

3090
02:12:38,099 --> 02:12:40,289
said typically twice as productive from

3091
02:12:40,289 --> 02:12:41,219
what they saw

3092
02:12:41,219 --> 02:12:43,349
you'll get thorough work that's well

3093
02:12:43,349 --> 02:12:45,360
done and a dedicated and passionate

3094
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:48,719
employee that love everything they do in

3095
02:12:48,719 --> 02:12:50,639
their job and are willing to work as

3096
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:55,050
hard as they can for the company some of

3097
02:12:55,050 --> 02:12:57,269
the more specific things that what I

3098
02:12:57,269 --> 02:12:59,519
like to do is I like to take what many

3099
02:12:59,519 --> 02:13:01,710
people would consider weaknesses or

3100
02:13:01,710 --> 02:13:04,260
disabilities or negative things affected

3101
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:08,880
with my autism and show how that can be

3102
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,920
used to your advantage rather than it

3103
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:13,550
being a disability and nothing more

3104
02:13:13,550 --> 02:13:16,499
for example I get bored really easily

3105
02:13:16,499 --> 02:13:19,219
I also knock out tasks pretty quick so

3106
02:13:19,219 --> 02:13:22,349
when I get bored at work I'm not the

3107
02:13:22,349 --> 02:13:24,210
kind of person who thinks we all get on

3108
02:13:24,210 --> 02:13:26,429
Twitter and like just hang out until

3109
02:13:26,429 --> 02:13:29,099
something else comes up for me and my

3110
02:13:29,099 --> 02:13:30,840
mind work his work and so for those

3111
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:32,940
eight hours I'm doing whatever it's

3112
02:13:32,940 --> 02:13:35,849
assigned to me well if I have nothing to

3113
02:13:35,849 --> 02:13:37,980
decide I get bored I googled the word

3114
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:40,920
bored and I just sit there and don't

3115
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:42,510
know what to do it stresses me out I

3116
02:13:42,510 --> 02:13:45,059
actually have a more difficult time when

3117
02:13:45,059 --> 02:13:47,340
I don't have anything to work on but you

3118
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:49,800
as an employer shouldn't think of this

3119
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:53,909
as a disability this is perfect for you

3120
02:13:53,909 --> 02:13:57,090
I write requisition orders and write

3121
02:13:57,090 --> 02:13:59,639
procedures and do all of the tasks that

3122
02:13:59,639 --> 02:14:03,210
nobody ever wants to do I do the entire

3123
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:07,050
and other duties as required of the job

3124
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:09,599
description because I would rather do

3125
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:11,489
that than sit around and either do

3126
02:14:11,489 --> 02:14:14,670
things non-work-related or do nothing so

3127
02:14:14,670 --> 02:14:16,619
as an employer this is not a benefit

3128
02:14:16,619 --> 02:14:18,510
this is not a disability or a weakness

3129
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:20,969
to you this is a major benefit and the

3130
02:14:20,969 --> 02:14:23,010
chance to have all those tasks that

3131
02:14:23,010 --> 02:14:24,749
every other employee groans about

3132
02:14:24,749 --> 02:14:28,789
completed with nothing said

3133
02:14:28,999 --> 02:14:32,570
like with my thing about specifying time

3134
02:14:32,570 --> 02:14:35,030
ranges and not using ambiguous phrasings

3135
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:37,999
and descriptions such as less busy try

3136
02:14:37,999 --> 02:14:39,800
and be specific with your instructions

3137
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:42,469
if you need me to do something try and

3138
02:14:42,469 --> 02:14:44,179
guide me in the direction of what I need

3139
02:14:44,179 --> 02:14:46,670
to do recently I've been really

3140
02:14:46,670 --> 02:14:49,190
frustrated with school from an academic

3141
02:14:49,190 --> 02:14:52,579
perspective because schools don't always

3142
02:14:52,579 --> 02:14:53,210
get it right

3143
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:56,449
and working full time like working in

3144
02:14:56,449 --> 02:14:57,860
the real industry I've learned things

3145
02:14:57,860 --> 02:14:59,329
are much different than with school

3146
02:14:59,329 --> 02:15:01,489
however I think the reason that I always

3147
02:15:01,489 --> 02:15:03,499
did school and enjoyed school was

3148
02:15:03,499 --> 02:15:05,510
because homework assignments tell you

3149
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:06,229
what to do

3150
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:08,510
they say click here and then click here

3151
02:15:08,510 --> 02:15:10,519
and then do this and then do that

3152
02:15:10,519 --> 02:15:12,320
they're very straightforward in their

3153
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,599
specific set of directions building

3154
02:15:14,599 --> 02:15:16,820
furniture - that's always fun to me

3155
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:18,679
because it tells me what to screw in

3156
02:15:18,679 --> 02:15:23,749
where and one so in the same way I find

3157
02:15:23,749 --> 02:15:26,570
it easier to perform an assignment when

3158
02:15:26,570 --> 02:15:29,749
I'm told what to do directly do this

3159
02:15:29,749 --> 02:15:33,440
specific task so I suggest that you try

3160
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:35,749
and do that within your employees but

3161
02:15:35,749 --> 02:15:39,409
also I'd like to learn and grow from my

3162
02:15:39,409 --> 02:15:41,539
weaknesses so if my weakness is that I'm

3163
02:15:41,539 --> 02:15:44,449
dependent on a specific outline and you

3164
02:15:44,449 --> 02:15:46,369
need me to be more - independent and

3165
02:15:46,369 --> 02:15:50,659
take a more broad assignment and get

3166
02:15:50,659 --> 02:15:52,639
into the nitty-gritty details of it and

3167
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:54,099
learn how to do it myself

3168
02:15:54,099 --> 02:15:57,199
teach me how to do that maybe slowly

3169
02:15:57,199 --> 02:15:59,630
wean me off of the direct instructions

3170
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:01,729
and be like well you know how last time

3171
02:16:01,729 --> 02:16:03,590
you did this I want you to do a similar

3172
02:16:03,590 --> 02:16:05,809
thing and kind of teach me how I can

3173
02:16:05,809 --> 02:16:07,880
learn myself to figure out the task

3174
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:10,460
without needing hand-holding the entire

3175
02:16:10,460 --> 02:16:12,349
time because I don't want to be hand

3176
02:16:12,349 --> 02:16:15,079
held but I also need to learn how to do

3177
02:16:15,079 --> 02:16:17,539
it myself as anyone would learn any

3178
02:16:17,539 --> 02:16:22,400
other task another aspect of

3179
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:25,249
high-functioning autism it's an intense

3180
02:16:25,249 --> 02:16:28,789
obsession with basically anything I had

3181
02:16:28,789 --> 02:16:31,729
varying obsessions growing up I had for

3182
02:16:31,729 --> 02:16:33,620
a while I really enjoyed like Guinness

3183
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:35,209
World Records and what Ripley's Believe

3184
02:16:35,209 --> 02:16:36,769
It or Not and had all the books and

3185
02:16:36,769 --> 02:16:40,040
videos and loved researching that after

3186
02:16:40,040 --> 02:16:41,730
that I moved to Doctor Who I

3187
02:16:41,730 --> 02:16:43,921
intense obsession with Doctor Who for

3188
02:16:43,921 --> 02:16:45,630
several years bought all the merchandise

3189
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:48,030
the magazines watched every episode like

3190
02:16:48,030 --> 02:16:52,110
20 times so again a lot of times I'm

3191
02:16:52,110 --> 02:16:54,240
that weirdo who's has the bedroom with

3192
02:16:54,240 --> 02:16:56,550
all the posters and I'm obsessed and all

3193
02:16:56,550 --> 02:16:58,080
I want to talk to you about is that

3194
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:01,230
specific subject but employers can use

3195
02:17:01,230 --> 02:17:02,610
this to their advantage because

3196
02:17:02,610 --> 02:17:04,139
typically they need to sneeze in a

3197
02:17:04,139 --> 02:17:07,740
specific area and you can assist these

3198
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:09,630
individuals and finding what their

3199
02:17:09,630 --> 02:17:11,280
interest is and what they can be an

3200
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:13,530
expert in because if you encourage me to

3201
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:16,350
be an expert on a specific topic I am

3202
02:17:16,350 --> 02:17:18,540
motivated to learn everything I can in

3203
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:20,850
that topic for example if you needed

3204
02:17:20,850 --> 02:17:22,620
someone who is really good at memory

3205
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:24,719
forensics because you found that there's

3206
02:17:24,719 --> 02:17:27,300
a lack of memory forensic skills send me

3207
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:29,130
some resources to memory forensics

3208
02:17:29,130 --> 02:17:31,200
challenges encouraged me to develop

3209
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:35,130
those skills send me to online CTS that

3210
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:37,171
include memory forensics challenges so I

3211
02:17:37,171 --> 02:17:39,421
can challenge my skills and all of a

3212
02:17:39,421 --> 02:17:41,160
sudden that's my obsession when I go

3213
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:43,530
home I'm learning these skills because

3214
02:17:43,530 --> 02:17:44,639
to me this is something I'm really

3215
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:46,830
interested in and I feel I'm good at I

3216
02:17:46,830 --> 02:17:48,930
want to improve my skills and then I

3217
02:17:48,930 --> 02:17:51,240
want to show them off at work how I'm a

3218
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:54,120
master at memory forensics now so that's

3219
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:57,540
the kind of thing where again strange

3220
02:17:57,540 --> 02:17:59,730
thing weird behavior a benefit to the

3221
02:17:59,730 --> 02:18:04,110
employer my final point I make in my

3222
02:18:04,110 --> 02:18:05,790
talk is that the most important thing

3223
02:18:05,790 --> 02:18:08,010
you can do is something that honestly as

3224
02:18:08,010 --> 02:18:10,500
a manager you should be doing with every

3225
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:12,719
single employee whether they are

3226
02:18:12,719 --> 02:18:14,760
neurotypical or having neurodiversity

3227
02:18:14,760 --> 02:18:17,280
disorder what you should be doing as

3228
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:19,950
being a mentor I find it particularly

3229
02:18:19,950 --> 02:18:22,110
helpful to me as an individual who has a

3230
02:18:22,110 --> 02:18:25,080
disability that I often don't realize

3231
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:27,660
what I'm doing but I also find this

3232
02:18:27,660 --> 02:18:30,860
important as I said to all employees

3233
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:33,719
what I'd recommend is taking 30 minutes

3234
02:18:33,719 --> 02:18:36,900
once every few months going at lunch

3235
02:18:36,900 --> 02:18:38,400
sitting down with your employee

3236
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:40,921
one-on-one and discussing with them what

3237
02:18:40,921 --> 02:18:42,570
you've noticed what they can improve on

3238
02:18:42,570 --> 02:18:45,270
ask them what they want what they think

3239
02:18:45,270 --> 02:18:47,130
they what they've been struggling with

3240
02:18:47,130 --> 02:18:49,380
that you can help them with have a real

3241
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:51,450
discussion about lines of improvement a

3242
02:18:51,450 --> 02:18:53,671
lot of times there's things I don't know

3243
02:18:53,671 --> 02:18:55,549
I'm doing and so it takes that

3244
02:18:55,549 --> 02:18:59,148
a few minutes aside where yes I'm the

3245
02:18:59,148 --> 02:19:00,920
center of attention basically and you

3246
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:03,950
tell me that hey you've been doing this

3247
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:05,780
in the office it's been making people

3248
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:06,379
mad

3249
02:19:06,379 --> 02:19:08,750
maybe we can readjust this behavior and

3250
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:11,058
how can we fix this and I will fix it

3251
02:19:11,058 --> 02:19:13,549
because again I don't want to do things

3252
02:19:13,549 --> 02:19:15,500
that are offending people or upsetting

3253
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:17,629
people but how can I fix what I don't

3254
02:19:17,629 --> 02:19:22,010
know so this is something again one of

3255
02:19:22,010 --> 02:19:23,808
the most important things on my list I

3256
02:19:23,808 --> 02:19:26,629
like to I like to learn what I'm doing

3257
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:28,968
wrong so I can fix it because though I

3258
02:19:28,968 --> 02:19:31,160
may have an understanding employer now

3259
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:34,340
who's willing to work with me I don't

3260
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:37,340
want you to be understanding in the

3261
02:19:37,340 --> 02:19:39,920
sense that you ignore everything that I

3262
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:43,549
do because oh it's just a thing because

3263
02:19:43,549 --> 02:19:45,468
what happens when I get a new job and

3264
02:19:45,468 --> 02:19:48,379
that employer isn't as understanding and

3265
02:19:48,379 --> 02:19:51,200
now I'm doing the exact same things that

3266
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:52,790
I didn't know I'm doing and I'm being

3267
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:54,770
penalized for them it's really not

3268
02:19:54,770 --> 02:19:57,649
benefiting anyone whereas if you at the

3269
02:19:57,649 --> 02:20:00,229
time or an understanding a manager and

3270
02:20:00,229 --> 02:20:02,319
you discuss with me where I can improve

3271
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:05,030
then that's how I'm going to go ahead

3272
02:20:05,030 --> 02:20:06,920
and grow and be able to move forward in

3273
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:12,380
life and be a better employee my talk

3274
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:13,850
always ends up being shorter than I

3275
02:20:13,850 --> 02:20:15,740
intend it to so I'm hoping there's some

3276
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:18,740
questions out there so that I can keep

3277
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:20,300
talking for a bit anyone got any

3278
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:22,479
questions

3279
02:20:29,490 --> 02:20:31,439
really the the getting bored one was the

3280
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:34,890
hardest because so the job I met now is

3281
02:20:34,890 --> 02:20:38,040
actually my first full-time job and I

3282
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:41,790
made at first a lot of managers found it

3283
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:43,620
more frustrating than anything for me to

3284
02:20:43,620 --> 02:20:45,149
be like what can I do what can I do what

3285
02:20:45,149 --> 02:20:46,890
can I do what can I do but then they

3286
02:20:46,890 --> 02:20:49,229
soon realize like when I'm saying that

3287
02:20:49,229 --> 02:20:51,390
like I will literally do anything so

3288
02:20:51,390 --> 02:20:53,729
like whoa there's this requisition order

3289
02:20:53,729 --> 02:20:55,530
that I didn't want to file three months

3290
02:20:55,530 --> 02:21:00,000
ago so here's the paperwork so that was

3291
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,859
really hard for me because when I sit

3292
02:21:01,859 --> 02:21:03,689
idle I get stressed and then I get

3293
02:21:03,689 --> 02:21:06,149
frustrated and really it add just AIT's

3294
02:21:06,149 --> 02:21:08,910
my condition more than everything so

3295
02:21:08,910 --> 02:21:10,710
that was what the biggest struggles but

3296
02:21:10,710 --> 02:21:13,170
again my managers took notice of that

3297
02:21:13,170 --> 02:21:16,050
and they've learned that the best thing

3298
02:21:16,050 --> 02:21:18,660
to do is to like have a list of tasks

3299
02:21:18,660 --> 02:21:20,729
kind of like backburner tasks that they

3300
02:21:20,729 --> 02:21:22,290
can throw at me when I come to them and

3301
02:21:22,290 --> 02:21:26,580
say that I need assistance any other

3302
02:21:26,580 --> 02:21:30,050
questions yeah

3303
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:45,840
yeah so it so one encouraged them that's

3304
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:51,510
a hard one so it's really all about

3305
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:54,330
encouragement I know a lot of times the

3306
02:21:54,330 --> 02:21:55,980
students with these conditions can just

3307
02:21:55,980 --> 02:21:58,380
get discouraged especially you know

3308
02:21:58,380 --> 02:22:01,230
knowing that they're there is some some

3309
02:22:01,230 --> 02:22:02,790
struggles in the industry getting in

3310
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:04,771
when when you have a disability and the

3311
02:22:04,771 --> 02:22:06,990
way people look at you so it's

3312
02:22:06,990 --> 02:22:09,870
encouraging them to themselves find the

3313
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:13,590
benefits and for them to learn why their

3314
02:22:13,590 --> 02:22:16,110
condition is a benefit to them and how

3315
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:18,721
to leverage those benefits rather than

3316
02:22:18,721 --> 02:22:20,400
accepting that they have a disability

3317
02:22:20,400 --> 02:22:23,130
and so they might not get a job and that

3318
02:22:23,130 --> 02:22:23,670
sucks

3319
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:25,980
so it's really about massaging I like

3320
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,010
making them realize because before they

3321
02:22:29,010 --> 02:22:30,780
can get their managers to realize they

3322
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:33,150
have to realize themselves so this first

3323
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:35,160
step is making sure they're confident in

3324
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,771
in their skills and confident in their

3325
02:22:37,771 --> 02:22:39,420
strengths and know what their strengths

3326
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:40,950
are rather than focusing on their

3327
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:43,280
weaknesses

3328
02:22:43,710 --> 02:22:46,080
I'd also I find a lot of individuals

3329
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:47,340
come to me and say they're having

3330
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:48,690
trouble getting connected into the

3331
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:52,471
community like the IT community so the

3332
02:22:52,471 --> 02:22:54,150
other thing is like pointing them in the

3333
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:55,980
directions of places they can network

3334
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:58,380
because we're also in an industry where

3335
02:22:58,380 --> 02:22:59,940
a lot of the times is about the people

3336
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:02,311
you know and so encouraging them to go

3337
02:23:02,311 --> 02:23:06,420
to meetups and conferences and CTS and

3338
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:07,860
develop those relationships in the

3339
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:11,460
industry can also help any other

3340
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:13,939
questions

3341
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:21,500
yeah

3342
02:23:29,830 --> 02:23:32,109
yeah there's the organizations that do

3343
02:23:32,109 --> 02:23:35,500
help individuals get in I'm not really I

3344
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:37,600
haven't been able to really find I like

3345
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:41,470
a more social community focused towards

3346
02:23:41,470 --> 02:23:43,960
that aspect obviously on Twitter there's

3347
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:46,600
it's a huge info set community and then

3348
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:48,670
at the same time I've discovered a huge

3349
02:23:48,670 --> 02:23:50,740
autistic community I love this if

3350
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:53,109
there's that overlap it's a great thing

3351
02:23:53,109 --> 02:23:54,640
that I'd love to do again there's a lot

3352
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:56,500
of neurodiversity conferences there's a

3353
02:23:56,500 --> 02:23:58,870
lot of IT conferences I think it'd be a

3354
02:23:58,870 --> 02:24:01,630
great thing to put that together it

3355
02:24:01,630 --> 02:24:03,850
probably is a lot of us people who would

3356
02:24:03,850 --> 02:24:06,100
be the attendees and the speakers don't

3357
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:08,500
have these social skills to do that and

3358
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:11,260
so is kind of hard making a social event

3359
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:15,670
with through non social people so but

3360
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:17,470
but that would be a great thing that I'd

3361
02:24:17,470 --> 02:24:23,188
love to see in the future yeah

3362
02:24:28,830 --> 02:24:34,020
yeah so um a lot of the times it's a lot

3363
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:36,660
of things that make it difficult to work

3364
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:38,550
with these individuals as they are weird

3365
02:24:38,550 --> 02:24:40,740
they do annoy people in a sense so I

3366
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:42,990
piss off my co-workers all the times

3367
02:24:42,990 --> 02:24:44,910
like it's surprising they keep me around

3368
02:24:44,910 --> 02:24:47,250
and still invite me out to the afternoon

3369
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:51,090
socials but so the the thing that is

3370
02:24:51,090 --> 02:24:53,130
kind of a bi-directional relationship

3371
02:24:53,130 --> 02:24:54,750
they need to learn that like some of the

3372
02:24:54,750 --> 02:24:56,910
things I do and say like I don't mean

3373
02:24:56,910 --> 02:24:58,920
and like if I offend them I probably

3374
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:00,840
don't know I'm offending them and so

3375
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:02,520
it's patience and understanding on that

3376
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:05,310
they're part but me learning it's also

3377
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:06,990
me taking into account that when they

3378
02:25:06,990 --> 02:25:08,760
say something like hey that wasn't cool

3379
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:10,680
like I can't get defensive like and be

3380
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:12,510
like oh well yeah you don't understand

3381
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:14,220
it's not fair and like blah blah blah

3382
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:16,380
like so it's a bi-directional

3383
02:25:16,380 --> 02:25:19,200
relationship of them understanding that

3384
02:25:19,200 --> 02:25:22,890
things I say and do are some things that

3385
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:24,660
I can't control or don't know about and

3386
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:26,910
me in return learning that the the

3387
02:25:26,910 --> 02:25:28,410
feedback they give me and the things

3388
02:25:28,410 --> 02:25:30,960
they say to me aren't meant to make me

3389
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:32,310
mad and they're not trying to be mean to

3390
02:25:32,310 --> 02:25:33,810
me they're trying to help me grow and

3391
02:25:33,810 --> 02:25:36,420
socialize and so it's also a lot about

3392
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:38,520
inclusiveness I've been really lucky to

3393
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:40,740
have these co-workers who despite me and

3394
02:25:40,740 --> 02:25:42,120
knowing them saw the times they'll still

3395
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:44,790
invite me out so after work socials so

3396
02:25:44,790 --> 02:25:47,310
it's a lot about it's the huge thing is

3397
02:25:47,310 --> 02:25:48,840
inclusiveness making sure that the

3398
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:51,030
employee doesn't feel set off to the

3399
02:25:51,030 --> 02:25:52,920
side and involving them in anything you

3400
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:54,270
do just as you would with another

3401
02:25:54,270 --> 02:26:01,800
employee yep and other questions okay

3402
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:03,120
well I really want to thank you for

3403
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:05,160
speaking and it's really been great if

3404
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:08,069
any of you are in the open sock training

3405
02:26:08,069 --> 02:26:09,960
with recon InfoSec tomorrow I'll see you

3406
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:12,030
guys there I'll be helping run that so

3407
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:15,050
should be a good time

3408
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:21,958
[Applause]

3409
02:26:42,020 --> 02:26:44,270
simple time about it being too long and

3410
02:26:44,270 --> 02:26:46,449
it's

3411
02:27:59,410 --> 02:28:02,410
like

3412
02:33:39,290 --> 02:33:42,290
yeah

3413
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:51,820
it's a very big state

3414
02:34:27,640 --> 02:34:30,740
[Music]

3415
02:36:53,670 --> 02:36:58,439
so maybe we do maybe we don't allow it

3416
02:44:44,170 --> 02:44:47,309
[Applause]

3417
02:52:02,499 --> 02:52:05,749
this might work okay so I guess we'll

3418
02:52:05,749 --> 02:52:06,380
get started

3419
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:08,270
I'm Chuck with Raska presenting over the

3420
02:52:08,270 --> 02:52:09,619
wire tips and tricks for executing

3421
02:52:09,619 --> 02:52:12,289
Python and memory a little bit about

3422
02:52:12,289 --> 02:52:14,180
myself I work a small cybersecurity

3423
02:52:14,180 --> 02:52:16,039
company called Black Lantern security in

3424
02:52:16,039 --> 02:52:17,239
Charleston South Carolina

3425
02:52:17,239 --> 02:52:21,199
do most of the dev work there pretty big

3426
02:52:21,199 --> 02:52:23,899
in the Python that's my main Jam kind of

3427
02:52:23,899 --> 02:52:25,939
fanboy and then if I'm probably known

3428
02:52:25,939 --> 02:52:26,989
for anything is for drinking Guinness

3429
02:52:26,989 --> 02:52:28,999
drink a lot again it's kind of infamous

3430
02:52:28,999 --> 02:52:32,709
for taking two at a time right away so

3431
02:52:32,709 --> 02:52:34,699
go over a little bit of what we're going

3432
02:52:34,699 --> 02:52:36,590
to talk about today why would you want

3433
02:52:36,590 --> 02:52:38,749
to execute Python in memory what can you

3434
02:52:38,749 --> 02:52:40,729
do if it they're a little bit of

3435
02:52:40,729 --> 02:52:42,439
background on Python importing because

3436
02:52:42,439 --> 02:52:43,909
that's probably the most important thing

3437
02:52:43,909 --> 02:52:46,069
how this is all going to work out and

3438
02:52:46,069 --> 02:52:48,919
then a demo basically just basically

3439
02:52:48,919 --> 02:52:51,680
owner of just doing stuff in memory some

3440
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:54,380
fancy importing some scheduling stuff

3441
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:55,880
when you don't have access to things

3442
02:52:55,880 --> 02:52:58,310
like a cron or task scheduler on windows

3443
02:52:58,310 --> 02:53:00,439
and then databases whether it be some

3444
02:53:00,439 --> 02:53:03,289
kind of file or relational database

3445
02:53:03,289 --> 02:53:06,800
small see some cool stuff there so use

3446
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:09,109
cases why would you want to do this for

3447
02:53:09,109 --> 02:53:10,880
Blue Team and Red Team to kind of stand

3448
02:53:10,880 --> 02:53:14,499
at the same side one of them might be

3449
02:53:14,499 --> 02:53:17,149
obstacle Amash cough this morning he

3450
02:53:17,149 --> 02:53:18,829
talked about sometimes we just give away

3451
02:53:18,829 --> 02:53:20,810
our source code and Python that's really

3452
02:53:20,810 --> 02:53:22,069
relevant because it's a scripting

3453
02:53:22,069 --> 02:53:23,419
language whatever you see is what you

3454
02:53:23,419 --> 02:53:27,590
get and so you're gonna see exactly what

3455
02:53:27,590 --> 02:53:28,340
people are doing

3456
02:53:28,340 --> 02:53:30,949
if the source code is there versus like

3457
02:53:30,949 --> 02:53:32,359
if it's native code you know it gets

3458
02:53:32,359 --> 02:53:33,829
compiled down to assembly or something

3459
02:53:33,829 --> 02:53:35,749
like that but that's useful for both

3460
02:53:35,749 --> 02:53:38,569
Blue Team and Red Team Blue team you

3461
02:53:38,569 --> 02:53:39,979
don't want to attack or know exactly

3462
02:53:39,979 --> 02:53:42,919
what your stuff does sometimes on the

3463
02:53:42,919 --> 02:53:44,419
red team you also don't want the blue

3464
02:53:44,419 --> 02:53:45,800
team to be able read your code and see

3465
02:53:45,800 --> 02:53:48,979
you download and bad stuff blue team

3466
02:53:48,979 --> 02:53:51,079
again one of the ways I've used it

3467
02:53:51,079 --> 02:53:53,419
before is the actually patched stuff

3468
02:53:53,419 --> 02:53:55,369
where I didn't want to write to disk I

3469
02:53:55,369 --> 02:53:57,680
just wanted to add new functionality to

3470
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:59,749
my program so I had a little runner in

3471
02:53:59,749 --> 02:54:01,489
there that would base the import from

3472
02:54:01,489 --> 02:54:03,949
outside instead of writing to disk and

3473
02:54:03,949 --> 02:54:05,959
importing from there are doing if you've

3474
02:54:05,959 --> 02:54:07,279
used Python some kind of pip install

3475
02:54:07,279 --> 02:54:08,840
something like that I could just do it

3476
02:54:08,840 --> 02:54:11,359
over the wire red team again you could

3477
02:54:11,359 --> 02:54:13,060
update your own software doing that

3478
02:54:13,060 --> 02:54:14,980
maybe you wanted to add new scanner

3479
02:54:14,980 --> 02:54:18,490
functionality to your Red Team tool and

3480
02:54:18,490 --> 02:54:20,980
Red Team another relevant one is you

3481
02:54:20,980 --> 02:54:22,180
don't want to write to disk a lot of

3482
02:54:22,180 --> 02:54:23,410
times because that's an indicator of

3483
02:54:23,410 --> 02:54:27,100
compromise you want to stop or you might

3484
02:54:27,100 --> 02:54:28,600
not be able to either they might have it

3485
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:30,610
access control to where you could get

3486
02:54:30,610 --> 02:54:32,800
your one little Python widget on there

3487
02:54:32,800 --> 02:54:34,960
and you want to load more stuff in and

3488
02:54:34,960 --> 02:54:36,190
the only way to do that was through

3489
02:54:36,190 --> 02:54:42,280
memory so Python importing if you've

3490
02:54:42,280 --> 02:54:44,470
ever program a Python you just see

3491
02:54:44,470 --> 02:54:46,480
something like do anything cool just

3492
02:54:46,480 --> 02:54:48,760
import whatever the library is called

3493
02:54:48,760 --> 02:54:51,550
and how that actually works there's two

3494
02:54:51,550 --> 02:54:53,500
things called finders and loaders and

3495
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:56,950
when you it's all imports American

3496
02:54:56,950 --> 02:54:58,810
Python first thing it does is it tries

3497
02:54:58,810 --> 02:55:02,110
to find where your Python script is

3498
02:55:02,110 --> 02:55:03,820
coming in so whatever you're importing

3499
02:55:03,820 --> 02:55:06,160
it's gonna look through first it looks

3500
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:08,590
through built-ins and then it looks

3501
02:55:08,590 --> 02:55:10,480
through site packages anything you might

3502
02:55:10,480 --> 02:55:12,810
have flowed through pip and then third

3503
02:55:12,810 --> 02:55:15,700
the other one is just in your Python

3504
02:55:15,700 --> 02:55:18,760
project if I look through there and this

3505
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:21,070
is really important on order to because

3506
02:55:21,070 --> 02:55:23,530
if you name something the same as it

3507
02:55:23,530 --> 02:55:25,300
built in it's actually gonna load the

3508
02:55:25,300 --> 02:55:26,560
built in first thing be really mad

3509
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:28,270
trying to debug why your thing isn't

3510
02:55:28,270 --> 02:55:29,740
doing what you think it is it's using

3511
02:55:29,740 --> 02:55:31,510
some functionality from a built in so

3512
02:55:31,510 --> 02:55:34,690
important to note on that what finders

3513
02:55:34,690 --> 02:55:37,750
don't do is pass a spec to a loader and

3514
02:55:37,750 --> 02:55:40,510
the loader halls it's doing is it knows

3515
02:55:40,510 --> 02:55:42,850
exactly where it has to load from now it

3516
02:55:42,850 --> 02:55:44,140
will do certain things though to check

3517
02:55:44,140 --> 02:55:47,170
to make sure it's not already loaded it

3518
02:55:47,170 --> 02:55:50,320
will tell it basically how to load it in

3519
02:55:50,320 --> 02:55:52,660
the memory one I'll show you example why

3520
02:55:52,660 --> 02:55:53,830
you have to tell at different ways

3521
02:55:53,830 --> 02:55:57,490
especially when we're going across the

3522
02:55:57,490 --> 02:55:59,640
wire

3523
02:55:59,940 --> 02:56:01,620
[Music]

3524
02:56:01,620 --> 02:56:04,271
okay so I'm gonna do a little demo here

3525
02:56:04,271 --> 02:56:08,761
show you some stuff so uh something I

3526
02:56:08,761 --> 02:56:11,650
cooked up basically so just a memory

3527
02:56:11,650 --> 02:56:13,601
importer and you can see right away

3528
02:56:13,601 --> 02:56:16,860
you got something called fine module and

3529
02:56:16,860 --> 02:56:20,110
basically we're gonna pass it what we're

3530
02:56:20,110 --> 02:56:23,681
gonna name it and this first one right

3531
02:56:23,681 --> 02:56:25,900
here is actually gonna see if it's a

3532
02:56:25,900 --> 02:56:28,271
built in again you don't want to step on

3533
02:56:28,271 --> 02:56:31,811
your own feet doing this and then on the

3534
02:56:31,811 --> 02:56:34,199
next one

3535
02:56:34,631 --> 02:56:40,870
it actually making sure nothing on the

3536
02:56:40,870 --> 02:56:42,580
site package either because the lorries

3537
02:56:42,580 --> 02:56:45,311
going to take care of that okay so the

3538
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:46,601
loaders kind of the more important part

3539
02:56:46,601 --> 02:56:49,811
when doing it in memory and it's gonna

3540
02:56:49,811 --> 02:56:51,400
load some packages it's gonna make sure

3541
02:56:51,400 --> 02:56:52,780
it's not there but the big part right

3542
02:56:52,780 --> 02:56:56,410
here is we're gonna tell it to read from

3543
02:56:56,410 --> 02:57:01,021
a URL to actually read the file across

3544
02:57:01,650 --> 02:57:05,860
and then again if you were headed or a

3545
02:57:05,860 --> 02:57:08,440
like a PI C file there's other modes you

3546
02:57:08,440 --> 02:57:17,290
have to do for that so this is just a

3547
02:57:17,290 --> 02:57:18,971
really simple example if using that to

3548
02:57:18,971 --> 02:57:21,700
load from a local server I'm gonna put

3549
02:57:21,700 --> 02:57:24,461
up here in a moment it's just a package

3550
02:57:24,461 --> 02:57:26,650
called neat if you want to see you what

3551
02:57:26,650 --> 02:57:29,471
that looks like I was gonna do is a

3552
02:57:29,471 --> 02:57:33,011
class with a print statement and the

3553
02:57:33,011 --> 02:57:35,440
server is just a class server that's

3554
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:38,950
going to open up its directory so any

3555
02:57:38,950 --> 02:57:41,230
path you hit there we can get the file

3556
02:57:41,230 --> 02:57:43,650
from there

3557
02:57:49,851 --> 02:57:53,540
so if we run this you see how neat is

3558
02:57:53,540 --> 02:57:55,820
this pretty neat I think I mean able do

3559
02:57:55,820 --> 02:57:57,380
a cross memory like that and all as it

3560
02:57:57,380 --> 02:57:59,960
did you see the server it actually looks

3561
02:57:59,960 --> 02:58:05,840
in that directory path for either it's

3562
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:09,380
either gonna look for a package or just

3563
02:58:09,380 --> 02:58:12,530
a Python module so in this case it went

3564
02:58:12,530 --> 02:58:14,721
first went for the module perla package

3565
02:58:14,721 --> 02:58:17,931
I couldn't find it so instead went to

3566
02:58:17,931 --> 02:58:19,340
the next level of let's just see if

3567
02:58:19,340 --> 02:58:20,931
there is just a file called that which

3568
02:58:20,931 --> 02:58:24,040
it was and I pulled over and executed

3569
02:58:24,040 --> 02:58:26,480
and so on the next sample this luckily

3570
02:58:26,480 --> 02:58:28,221
in Python you don't usually have to

3571
02:58:28,221 --> 02:58:29,181
write your own stuff because there's

3572
02:58:29,181 --> 02:58:30,891
awesome people out there who write stuff

3573
02:58:30,891 --> 02:58:32,450
for you and so there's actually is

3574
02:58:32,450 --> 02:58:34,641
called a package called HTTP import

3575
02:58:34,641 --> 02:58:36,380
which does all that stuff I just showed

3576
02:58:36,380 --> 02:58:37,370
you you don't have to write your own

3577
02:58:37,370 --> 02:58:38,990
finder and loader if you don't want to

3578
02:58:38,990 --> 02:58:44,620
you can just use this if you're using

3579
02:58:44,620 --> 02:58:47,391
just HTTP it makes you throw this up

3580
02:58:47,391 --> 02:58:49,600
there

3581
02:58:49,811 --> 02:58:53,931
it has a contact management for remote

3582
02:58:53,931 --> 02:58:56,660
repos so that it will both load it into

3583
02:58:56,660 --> 02:58:58,940
your namespace and remove it after

3584
02:58:58,940 --> 02:59:01,040
you're done sometimes you may want that

3585
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:03,380
something you may not just you don't

3586
02:59:03,380 --> 02:59:04,790
want namespace conflicts is one reason

3587
02:59:04,790 --> 02:59:07,360
not to do that or one reason to do that

3588
02:59:07,360 --> 02:59:10,130
and so you can see we can give it a list

3589
02:59:10,130 --> 02:59:12,650
of modules to import again let's tell it

3590
02:59:12,650 --> 02:59:14,391
what URL to hit and we have the server

3591
02:59:14,391 --> 02:59:19,870
up and these would be the imports you do

3592
02:59:19,870 --> 02:59:23,870
to get be able to access this but say

3593
02:59:23,870 --> 02:59:26,391
you didn't know the names or something

3594
02:59:26,391 --> 02:59:26,690
like that

3595
02:59:26,690 --> 02:59:28,580
and you want to make it more dynamic you

3596
02:59:28,580 --> 02:59:30,771
could do a request across get a list of

3597
02:59:30,771 --> 02:59:34,070
imports import them into some kind of

3598
02:59:34,070 --> 02:59:36,110
dictionary or some data structure and

3599
02:59:36,110 --> 02:59:38,750
actually access them that way to instead

3600
02:59:38,750 --> 02:59:42,530
of using the namespace to hit them so if

3601
02:59:42,530 --> 02:59:45,221
we run this one

3602
02:59:48,119 --> 02:59:51,729
so again I you'll see repeated text

3603
02:59:51,729 --> 02:59:53,439
because we did it both with the

3604
02:59:53,439 --> 02:59:56,770
namespace and one without so again the

3605
02:59:56,770 --> 02:59:58,300
neat one prints out how neat is this

3606
02:59:58,300 --> 03:00:02,050
pretty neat we just to show you the

3607
03:00:02,050 --> 03:00:07,300
hello one is a package so you can see we

3608
03:00:07,300 --> 03:00:10,600
have this exposed over here and it has a

3609
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:13,569
file inside there so sometimes when you

3610
03:00:13,569 --> 03:00:17,020
see like the from hello import hi hello

3611
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:18,520
is the package and we can import stuff

3612
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:21,760
from there caveat saan this when using

3613
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:24,640
this HTTP import it doesn't like when

3614
03:00:24,640 --> 03:00:26,080
your package name is the same as the

3615
03:00:26,080 --> 03:00:28,029
file name you're importing so if it was

3616
03:00:28,029 --> 03:00:31,210
from hi import hi it would fail out so

3617
03:00:31,210 --> 03:00:32,590
just something to note if you do use it

3618
03:00:32,590 --> 03:00:34,479
and another caveat to doing this stuff

3619
03:00:34,479 --> 03:00:38,470
in memory is it has to be Python files

3620
03:00:38,470 --> 03:00:40,750
for here you might be able to make a

3621
03:00:40,750 --> 03:00:42,310
finder loader some how to do it but you

3622
03:00:42,310 --> 03:00:43,600
think of stuff like shared objects or

3623
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:46,180
dll's those aren't going to work for

3624
03:00:46,180 --> 03:00:49,270
this so things like there's my sequel

3625
03:00:49,270 --> 03:00:52,540
database has like a shared object for

3626
03:00:52,540 --> 03:00:54,010
Linux like you not gonna be able load up

3627
03:00:54,010 --> 03:00:56,550
something like that necessarily but

3628
03:00:56,550 --> 03:00:59,500
again you can just see okay you got into

3629
03:00:59,500 --> 03:01:01,359
memory we're able to load code across

3630
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:03,040
and they're doing pretty simple things

3631
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:04,840
but we'll do some cooler stuff a little

3632
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:06,989
bit

3633
03:01:11,990 --> 03:01:14,521
so that's just exiting code and then

3634
03:01:14,521 --> 03:01:15,931
there's stuff like what if you want to

3635
03:01:15,931 --> 03:01:18,150
schedule something a lot of times when

3636
03:01:18,150 --> 03:01:19,170
you're building out something you want

3637
03:01:19,170 --> 03:01:21,601
to do something at certain time usually

3638
03:01:21,601 --> 03:01:23,220
have access to something like cron job

3639
03:01:23,220 --> 03:01:26,431
or task scheduler and windows there's a

3640
03:01:26,431 --> 03:01:31,101
neat library in a Python called schedule

3641
03:01:31,101 --> 03:01:34,670
that allows you reduce scheduled tasks

3642
03:01:34,670 --> 03:01:39,120
and again another so I was looking it

3643
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:41,521
off my server I have running locally but

3644
03:01:41,521 --> 03:01:43,440
you can also you know go to github or

3645
03:01:43,440 --> 03:01:46,021
something they have a nice magic get

3646
03:01:46,021 --> 03:01:47,580
help function here but all it's doing is

3647
03:01:47,580 --> 03:01:49,080
getting to the ROC content and pulling

3648
03:01:49,080 --> 03:01:52,260
that file across and so we're gonna do

3649
03:01:52,260 --> 03:01:55,771
here and schedule something as soon as

3650
03:01:55,771 --> 03:01:57,300
this program starts it's going to create

3651
03:01:57,300 --> 03:01:59,750
a loop it's gonna check for any

3652
03:01:59,750 --> 03:02:04,490
scheduled jobs I so sleep a little bit

3653
03:02:04,490 --> 03:02:06,450
then we have a little flag here it's

3654
03:02:06,450 --> 03:02:07,980
gonna load in new scheduled stuff from

3655
03:02:07,980 --> 03:02:10,910
my server to tell the scheduled new jobs

3656
03:02:10,910 --> 03:02:13,710
but it starts off with just a ten-second

3657
03:02:13,710 --> 03:02:16,021
job and then the new schedule when it

3658
03:02:16,021 --> 03:02:18,480
hits will add a new job called added new

3659
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:20,311
schedule every five seconds again this

3660
03:02:20,311 --> 03:02:21,931
is looking at cross from memory so

3661
03:02:21,931 --> 03:02:23,101
that's another cool thing right here

3662
03:02:23,101 --> 03:02:24,720
because we're loading that schedule from

3663
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:27,300
github we can still use that even though

3664
03:02:27,300 --> 03:02:28,681
we don't have it loaded on our computer

3665
03:02:28,681 --> 03:02:31,440
because we loaded that namespace into a

3666
03:02:31,440 --> 03:02:34,230
memory and so even though this one has

3667
03:02:34,230 --> 03:02:37,170
no idea schedules on that computer it

3668
03:02:37,170 --> 03:02:38,370
will find out as soon as it tries to

3669
03:02:38,370 --> 03:02:41,641
import this when you saw the loader the

3670
03:02:41,641 --> 03:02:43,141
loader already looks for stuff pretty

3671
03:02:43,141 --> 03:02:45,720
loaded so it will know that schedules

3672
03:02:45,720 --> 03:02:46,710
there and it doesn't need to try to

3673
03:02:46,710 --> 03:02:48,480
import it from here which is nice

3674
03:02:48,480 --> 03:02:49,740
because then we can actually use it in

3675
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:58,290
other scripts so if we run this you'll

3676
03:02:58,290 --> 03:03:01,141
see it start adding jobs here again

3677
03:03:01,141 --> 03:03:02,580
there's one we already have on here -

3678
03:03:02,580 --> 03:03:05,101
this runs every 10 seconds and then

3679
03:03:05,101 --> 03:03:07,050
there's one that we added that adds new

3680
03:03:07,050 --> 03:03:09,360
ones every five seconds so if you need

3681
03:03:09,360 --> 03:03:11,610
to run like a scan every you know you

3682
03:03:11,610 --> 03:03:13,200
can create jitter and stuff to feed at

3683
03:03:13,200 --> 03:03:14,190
different stuff you can run it on

3684
03:03:14,190 --> 03:03:16,351
certain days schedules pretty cool for

3685
03:03:16,351 --> 03:03:18,720
that and again doing this all in memory

3686
03:03:18,720 --> 03:03:19,980
so we didn't touch this which is really

3687
03:03:19,980 --> 03:03:23,930
nice to be able to automate stuff

3688
03:03:24,799 --> 03:03:27,049
through a schedule and not have to talk

3689
03:03:27,049 --> 03:03:28,759
to the OS or any think that and give

3690
03:03:28,759 --> 03:03:34,339
ourselves away so that's kind of neat

3691
03:03:34,339 --> 03:03:39,619
next thing is databases so usually

3692
03:03:39,619 --> 03:03:41,390
there's not too many things that do this

3693
03:03:41,390 --> 03:03:43,009
but sequel light happens allow you to

3694
03:03:43,009 --> 03:03:45,140
just pull in a whole database in memory

3695
03:03:45,140 --> 03:03:46,069
which is really nice

3696
03:03:46,069 --> 03:03:47,569
again thank you for like scanning

3697
03:03:47,569 --> 03:03:49,039
something you're scanning for hosts

3698
03:03:49,039 --> 03:03:51,619
around you you could just put it into

3699
03:03:51,619 --> 03:03:53,569
some kind of flat file memory but then

3700
03:03:53,569 --> 03:03:56,629
it's really hard to both update that dig

3701
03:03:56,629 --> 03:03:58,970
out certain data you want before that so

3702
03:03:58,970 --> 03:04:01,850
I'm gonna look at actually creating a

3703
03:04:01,850 --> 03:04:08,419
database in memory and go to code here a

3704
03:04:08,419 --> 03:04:11,449
little bit we have a save DB function

3705
03:04:11,449 --> 03:04:13,270
that's gonna save it back to our server

3706
03:04:13,270 --> 03:04:16,159
we have a load DB function that's gonna

3707
03:04:16,159 --> 03:04:19,100
load it back up from the server and the

3708
03:04:19,100 --> 03:04:22,850
main one right here is gonna just create

3709
03:04:22,850 --> 03:04:27,369
a database insert some data into there

3710
03:04:27,369 --> 03:04:29,569
it's gonna select them data just to show

3711
03:04:29,569 --> 03:04:32,409
that we actually put some data in there

3712
03:04:32,409 --> 03:04:36,229
if you see this hitter dump it's

3713
03:04:36,229 --> 03:04:40,129
actually pulling out the transactions so

3714
03:04:40,129 --> 03:04:42,470
you're not actually saving the database

3715
03:04:42,470 --> 03:04:43,579
you're saving the commands that make

3716
03:04:43,579 --> 03:04:45,259
that database so you'll see like create

3717
03:04:45,259 --> 03:04:48,919
table scans insert XYZ things like that

3718
03:04:48,919 --> 03:04:52,029
and that's what we're actually saving

3719
03:04:53,199 --> 03:04:58,249
again if you do it in memory and again

3720
03:04:58,249 --> 03:04:59,989
this a contact manager so as soon as you

3721
03:04:59,989 --> 03:05:03,249
leave this contact manager it goes away

3722
03:05:03,249 --> 03:05:08,629
so just gonna show you that to that you

3723
03:05:08,629 --> 03:05:10,689
have to be kind of careful about that

3724
03:05:10,689 --> 03:05:13,579
because we're outside of the first one

3725
03:05:13,579 --> 03:05:15,109
but let's say we make a new connection

3726
03:05:15,109 --> 03:05:17,209
to the memory obviously just disappeared

3727
03:05:17,209 --> 03:05:19,279
got eaten up by garbage collection

3728
03:05:19,279 --> 03:05:21,850
because we said we were done with it and

3729
03:05:21,850 --> 03:05:24,770
if we try to look for that again it's

3730
03:05:24,770 --> 03:05:27,199
gonna air out and that's right here a

3731
03:05:27,199 --> 03:05:29,180
print this will be hid because we are

3732
03:05:29,180 --> 03:05:30,829
not gonna have it table just trying to

3733
03:05:30,829 --> 03:05:33,649
show that and then the load BB is gonna

3734
03:05:33,649 --> 03:05:36,169
pick back up from our server what we

3735
03:05:36,169 --> 03:05:38,330
saved there

3736
03:05:38,330 --> 03:05:40,400
I'm another cool thing I'll hit on here

3737
03:05:40,400 --> 03:05:43,550
before we demo it is something called

3738
03:05:43,550 --> 03:05:48,050
the IO import so right here you can see

3739
03:05:48,050 --> 03:05:50,120
we're gonna make a temp file again this

3740
03:05:50,120 --> 03:05:52,460
is making a file in memory so we're not

3741
03:05:52,460 --> 03:05:53,960
touching disk and we're going to write

3742
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:58,010
our sequel transactions through that

3743
03:05:58,010 --> 03:06:00,530
file and then send that over so that we

3744
03:06:00,530 --> 03:06:01,910
don't have to create a file on disk to

3745
03:06:01,910 --> 03:06:07,520
do it so what this should do is create a

3746
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:09,229
table write some data to it save it to

3747
03:06:09,229 --> 03:06:11,510
our server and then our server's gonna

3748
03:06:11,510 --> 03:06:15,650
send back that DB file to us so they can

3749
03:06:15,650 --> 03:06:20,090
read it again and so that went pretty

3750
03:06:20,090 --> 03:06:24,020
fast but the Select right here is what

3751
03:06:24,020 --> 03:06:26,300
you see in this first one that's the

3752
03:06:26,300 --> 03:06:29,210
data in our database the this will be

3753
03:06:29,210 --> 03:06:31,010
hid was when we tried to access that

3754
03:06:31,010 --> 03:06:33,590
memory again again we got out of that

3755
03:06:33,590 --> 03:06:36,350
context so in destroyed the database and

3756
03:06:36,350 --> 03:06:38,510
so this will be hid no such table name

3757
03:06:38,510 --> 03:06:40,310
scan data which we expected and then

3758
03:06:40,310 --> 03:06:45,260
when we loaded back up the database you

3759
03:06:45,260 --> 03:06:46,700
can see again we're gonna try to select

3760
03:06:46,700 --> 03:06:48,800
that data again and we got it this time

3761
03:06:48,800 --> 03:06:51,290
because uh it's headed back over and you

3762
03:06:51,290 --> 03:06:53,479
can see on our server side here we have

3763
03:06:53,479 --> 03:06:55,130
our scans file it's actually just a

3764
03:06:55,130 --> 03:06:59,600
transaction data okay so that's pretty

3765
03:06:59,600 --> 03:07:02,270
much it for the examples but I wanted to

3766
03:07:02,270 --> 03:07:03,350
put it all together just to show you

3767
03:07:03,350 --> 03:07:05,990
like how useful could this be to me

3768
03:07:05,990 --> 03:07:08,300
those are pretty short examples of doing

3769
03:07:08,300 --> 03:07:10,160
something let us say you wanted some

3770
03:07:10,160 --> 03:07:13,330
kind of control on command

3771
03:07:13,330 --> 03:07:15,290
so you just want to be able to run

3772
03:07:15,290 --> 03:07:17,390
commands give it some data and do some

3773
03:07:17,390 --> 03:07:24,440
stuff show you the scan file so this is

3774
03:07:24,440 --> 03:07:25,670
gonna be a whole script we're gonna send

3775
03:07:25,670 --> 03:07:28,490
it over it has schedule in it something

3776
03:07:28,490 --> 03:07:30,680
that our computer shouldn't know

3777
03:07:30,680 --> 03:07:32,229
anything about because it's not

3778
03:07:32,229 --> 03:07:34,760
installed we're gonna read it from

3779
03:07:34,760 --> 03:07:38,540
github and we're gonna say save a

3780
03:07:38,540 --> 03:07:41,840
database every five seconds I believe

3781
03:07:41,840 --> 03:07:43,250
it's what we're gonna schedule to do it

3782
03:07:43,250 --> 03:07:46,960
basically we're going to pretend lips

3783
03:07:46,960 --> 03:07:50,369
we're gonna pretend this is a scan

3784
03:07:50,369 --> 03:07:51,689
we're just gonna put data a database and

3785
03:07:51,689 --> 03:07:54,479
throw it back and so you could think

3786
03:07:54,479 --> 03:07:56,270
about this like what if you wanted to

3787
03:07:56,270 --> 03:07:59,189
scan hosts around you and then keep

3788
03:07:59,189 --> 03:08:01,379
updating some central database you could

3789
03:08:01,379 --> 03:08:04,109
have every client you have some vector

3790
03:08:04,109 --> 03:08:05,459
server all the data it's getting and

3791
03:08:05,459 --> 03:08:07,709
then readjust that in your own database

3792
03:08:07,709 --> 03:08:09,930
that's central so that you know more

3793
03:08:09,930 --> 03:08:14,579
date about it and yeah so how's this

3794
03:08:14,579 --> 03:08:16,560
gonna do is schedule every five seconds

3795
03:08:16,560 --> 03:08:23,669
to do that scan and the runner is pretty

3796
03:08:23,669 --> 03:08:25,890
basic it doesn't do a whole lot other

3797
03:08:25,890 --> 03:08:30,569
than the first thing it does when it

3798
03:08:30,569 --> 03:08:31,979
runs the command is the checks let's see

3799
03:08:31,979 --> 03:08:33,509
if it has any imports that need to be

3800
03:08:33,509 --> 03:08:36,209
imported again because a lot of these

3801
03:08:36,209 --> 03:08:38,129
are gonna be coming into memory and

3802
03:08:38,129 --> 03:08:41,129
we're gonna stay stick them there then

3803
03:08:41,129 --> 03:08:42,749
the main is just something I'm making in

3804
03:08:42,749 --> 03:08:45,029
my scripts I'm sending across so I know

3805
03:08:45,029 --> 03:08:51,089
what to run okay and this is just an

3806
03:08:51,089 --> 03:08:59,569
outlook to when we run this you can see

3807
03:08:59,569 --> 03:09:04,829
it imported the scan and then we also

3808
03:09:04,829 --> 03:09:06,569
have one called run because you need

3809
03:09:06,569 --> 03:09:09,779
something that actually hit the schedule

3810
03:09:09,779 --> 03:09:10,979
to tell it they actually run the job

3811
03:09:10,979 --> 03:09:12,689
that it's supposed to be doing but you

3812
03:09:12,689 --> 03:09:13,770
won't see scan ever show up again

3813
03:09:13,770 --> 03:09:15,989
because I have it off the command list

3814
03:09:15,989 --> 03:09:18,089
after the first time so every five

3815
03:09:18,089 --> 03:09:19,589
seconds we're running a scheduled scan

3816
03:09:19,589 --> 03:09:22,770
basically in memory to a database saying

3817
03:09:22,770 --> 03:09:24,299
that database back to us so that

3818
03:09:24,299 --> 03:09:25,379
hopefully you can do something useful

3819
03:09:25,379 --> 03:09:29,609
for it to it and you'll see we're

3820
03:09:29,609 --> 03:09:30,810
getting database files with timestamps

3821
03:09:30,810 --> 03:09:35,538
on them from that scanning actually

3822
03:09:37,499 --> 03:09:39,359
and that's pretty much a talk I just

3823
03:09:39,359 --> 03:09:41,819
want to give a thanks to Dakota Khan for

3824
03:09:41,819 --> 03:09:44,180
inviting me out to give this talk

3825
03:09:44,180 --> 03:09:47,399
there's a bunch of links on here there's

3826
03:09:47,399 --> 03:09:49,409
a link to a repo of code that I was just

3827
03:09:49,409 --> 03:09:52,949
showing get on HP imports pretty cool

3828
03:09:52,949 --> 03:09:55,439
that's the memory importer if you don't

3829
03:09:55,439 --> 03:09:57,749
want to write your own schedule

3830
03:09:57,749 --> 03:10:01,170
the scheduler Python program and then

3831
03:10:01,170 --> 03:10:04,020
these last few links are about basically

3832
03:10:04,020 --> 03:10:06,270
how importing works in Python if you

3833
03:10:06,270 --> 03:10:07,289
want to read more about that there's a

3834
03:10:07,289 --> 03:10:11,939
bunch of links there and with that I

3835
03:10:11,939 --> 03:10:23,520
guess are there any questions so I'm

3836
03:10:23,520 --> 03:10:25,739
saving them to an in-memory file if you

3837
03:10:25,739 --> 03:10:28,890
saw again this string i/o and it's just

3838
03:10:28,890 --> 03:10:37,050
transactions so I'm making a temp file

3839
03:10:37,050 --> 03:10:38,970
basically so I can dump that transaction

3840
03:10:38,970 --> 03:10:41,670
data and then I'm sending that file from

3841
03:10:41,670 --> 03:10:44,039
memory to the server so it's never

3842
03:10:44,039 --> 03:10:47,449
touching disk in the client

3843
03:10:52,939 --> 03:10:56,060
okay and if you have any questions and

3844
03:10:56,060 --> 03:10:57,439
sitting around town don't be afraid to

3845
03:10:57,439 --> 03:11:00,789
ask or than that that's it

3846
03:11:01,690 --> 03:11:07,959
[Applause]

3847
03:12:28,660 --> 03:12:31,380
right

3848
03:12:33,540 --> 03:12:40,890
what's that Wow
