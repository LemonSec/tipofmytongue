1
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,340
giving up my house but still we're gonna

2
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,419
have I promise you we're gonna have a

3
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:34,679
good time

4
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,720
so for this presentation I try to come

5
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,220
up with kind of a provocative title

6
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,539
which is like do you need a security

7
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,159
team right which makes you think well

8
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,919
we're talking to say right so um but

9
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,299
we're going to work through it and um

10
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,980
you know talk through a few things um

11
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,720
and hopefully have a good time

12
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,340
um before we get started so I work at

13
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,779
trusted Tech we're in a security

14
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,520
consulting company based in Northeast

15
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,080
Ohio work around the world all different

16
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,220
kinds of things

17
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,960
but one of the things whenever I go to a

18
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,820
presentation I always think like well

19
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,900
why should I listen to this person

20
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,159
that's talking right like you see a lot

21
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,620
of presentations and what I always say

22
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,700
is I'm certainly not smarter than

23
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,900
anybody else but I've been doing this

24
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,220
for a very long time

25
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,880
um

26
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,080
so I've been at Charleston tech for

27
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,059
about 10 years prior to that work for a

28
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,220
security startup for a few years that we

29
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,419
sold to Oracle and before that wasn't

30
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,059
security Consulting as well uh and I've

31
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,559
really been privileged and fortunate to

32
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,000
work with organizations of all sizes so

33
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,620
everything from sole proprietorships um

34
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,360
you know where somebody writes the code

35
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,740
takes out the trash

36
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,340
um

37
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,080
you know does all the sales all the way

38
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,299
up to the fortune 10. um and so a lot of

39
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:31,620
board presentations a lot of working

40
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,820
with different organizations we got to

41
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,260
see what works and what doesn't

42
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,900
um as far as uh certification I've been

43
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,000
a CI SSP forever um

44
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,880
and have a ISO 27 0001 lead auditor I

45
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,460
let my PCI qsa expire a long time ago

46
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,740
and a couple other things but very

47
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,700
familiar with a lot of the Frameworks

48
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,539
and standards that are out there

49
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,059
so I was on Twitter I think it was and I

50
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,500
read about how to give a presentation

51
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,480
and it said that you should give your

52
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,120
conclusion first uh to kind of

53
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,200
let people know what they're going to

54
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,520
hear right and tie it back to it in the

55
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,840
end

56
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,480
and I think the important thing is

57
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,159
um over the years I've really come to

58
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,840
the conclusion that a lot of what we

59
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,220
think of as security functions or

60
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,980
security roles uh also could very easily

61
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,240
have a home in other parts of the

62
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,380
organization

63
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,159
um

64
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,740
they can very easily be distributed to

65
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,100
other functions in the org um and and by

66
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,299
that I don't mean just training

67
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:25,679
everybody and saying security is

68
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,140
everybody's job right it's really the

69
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,640
different things that we think of as

70
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,039
security roles really can be done by

71
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,840
other functions um and with security

72
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,720
providing an oversight and a uh kind of

73
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,440
a guidance and governance function

74
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,000
so that usually upsets a lot of people

75
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,559
because people wonder you know what am I

76
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,059
going to say about that and we'll get to

77
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,200
what I promise

78
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,580
but also I think it's really important

79
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,960
to consider the source

80
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,100
um we're going to talk about you know

81
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,500
kind of My Views uh with how specialized

82
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,240
Securities become it's very difficult

83
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,820
oftentimes to have a full team and

84
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,960
Outsourcing it can make a lot of sense

85
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,640
in a lot of places but of course I work

86
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,440
for a consulting company right I mean so

87
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,000
I want to be very clear right I mean

88
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,140
it's kind of like if I tell you that you

89
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,700
need you know something that's very

90
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,380
important that I disclose that's the

91
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,700
industry that I'm in right I mean you

92
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,740
know they'll be unfair not to

93
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,039
um but uh yeah I think hopefully uh you

94
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:14,880
know we're gonna say is going to make

95
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,039
some sense feel free to ask questions uh

96
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,419
yeah let me cut me off whatever else

97
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,020
throughout this

98
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,919
but another thing is of course having a

99
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,679
shocking claim right and you know if you

100
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,940
look at this article from a while back

101
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,679
you know it talks from Bloomberg it

102
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,960
talks about you know how many job

103
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,299
openings there are right

104
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,500
um you know some sources will tell you

105
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,480
there are a couple million job openings

106
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,380
right

107
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,600
um and you start to wonder whether

108
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,279
that's really a shortage or more of a

109
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,980
misalignment of expectations the other

110
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,020
piece is really the definition of what a

111
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:47,940
cyber security rule is I mean there's

112
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,440
some that are pretty obvious right like

113
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,900
a pen tester or certain governance roles

114
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,000
perhaps but a lot of what we think of as

115
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,700
a security function is also a basic I.T

116
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,140
function in a lot of ways right so if

117
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,299
you have a firewall admin who's putting

118
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,039
in Secure rules right is that a security

119
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,559
role or an I.T role

120
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,120
um

121
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,400
the other thing is you know there feels

122
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,600
like there's not necessarily a shortage

123
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,039
of people that want to work in security

124
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,919
but there still is a shortage of people

125
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,419
um who are who are great at it in a lot

126
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:18,000
of ways and a lot of these things aren't

127
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,640
art as much as the science and you also

128
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,919
with individual specialization there are

129
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:23,940
a lot of people who might be very good

130
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,760
at one technology right or one function

131
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,380
that might be very good at you know

132
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,940
application security or they might be

133
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,140
very good at a certain specific

134
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,580
technology

135
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,480
um

136
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,279
but that doesn't necessarily mean that

137
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,779
you can hire one person that can do

138
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,159
everything right oftentimes you need to

139
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,020
have these larger teams where it's going

140
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,399
to make more sense to kind of spread

141
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,500
these functions and rules out sorry

142
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,440
across different you know functions

143
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,240
and there also seems to be a huge

144
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,740
shortage of organizations that really

145
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,360
understand the market Hey Kevin how are

146
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,600
you so

147
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:57,539
um so Kevin and I work together

148
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:58,860
sorry sorry to call you out in the

149
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,820
middle of this

150
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,480
um

151
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,980
I also think you really like real quick

152
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,720
aside I was saying earlier I was on a

153
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,740
stage just like this at the Federal

154
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,840
Reserve a few years ago when I fell off

155
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,460
right in the middle of a presentation so

156
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,360
I'm a little nervous about walking

157
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,860
around so I'll probably do that a little

158
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,779
bit less

159
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,600
but it's funny because you know in this

160
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,679
industry you tend to get a lot of

161
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,059
recruiting emails

162
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,580
and they're absolutely ridiculous

163
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,419
um you know one of the things I've

164
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,279
always done is I will always talk to

165
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,600
recruiters I know a lot of people don't

166
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,480
like to and for two reasons right I like

167
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,559
to know what companies are hiring

168
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,059
because maybe they need us to help do

169
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,399
some work is one thing but another thing

170
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,080
is you know I'll have friends and I have

171
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,340
people that are looking for work and if

172
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,720
a recruiter wants to call me about a job

173
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,100
I'm happy to what are the requirements

174
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,360
what are the expectations maybe I know

175
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,740
somebody right

176
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,260
um and help help in that way

177
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,179
but they'll oftentimes look for somebody

178
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,580
that can do just this really broad range

179
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,039
of things you know and and with things

180
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,500
that just don't exist in one person and

181
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,000
oftentimes we'll have a really low

182
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,679
salary to offer for us and it's not

183
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,360
realistic in the market

184
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,279
um you know people are also oftentimes

185
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,539
looking when they talk about like a CSO

186
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,860
or whatever

187
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,600
at mid-sized companies the other guys

188
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,520
want somebody that can do governance

189
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,620
right policies build a program do

190
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,779
strategy but also get their hands dirty

191
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,460
and plug things in and configure things

192
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,340
and everything else and fewer and fewer

193
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,600
of those people are existing in the

194
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,880
market and they're commanding a very

195
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,799
high salary so something to think about

196
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,559
as well as we look at whether or not

197
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,779
we're going to you know continue to

198
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,580
structure Security Programs in the way

199
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,059
that we have

200
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,440
and one of the things is because there's

201
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,419
so much specialization as I said I've

202
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:35,100
been with my current company about 10

203
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,200
years and been in the industry

204
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
longer than that but in the old days you

205
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,640
know I felt like I had a really good

206
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,840
handle on just about every security

207
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,080
domain out there right you could really

208
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,000
know and have some awareness of you know

209
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,860
most of the security software

210
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,120
um you know you could kind of have an

211
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,220
idea of of all these things

212
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,380
but now it's gotten extremely

213
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,600
specialized uh you know their tools and

214
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
software out there that are less a tool

215
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,159
or software or more so a career right

216
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,779
there are certain things that you might

217
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,399
buy for the environment that you then

218
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,779
have to hire somebody that's a

219
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:07,980
specialist in it

220
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,940
um

221
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,580
and it's just continued to become more

222
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,860
and more specialized and I think has led

223
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,539
to uh you know additional Outsourcing

224
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,820
and other things like that

225
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,020
and when you start to continue to look

226
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,520
at organizations and how much

227
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,260
specialization they can have right are

228
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,460
they going to have 20 different people

229
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,799
that each of them does a very specific

230
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,299
different thing as opposed to utility

231
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,880
players and I'm more of a utility player

232
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,679
myself but oftentimes utility players

233
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,000
are going to have that depth of

234
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,260
knowledge in every domain

235
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,940
and one of the things I open them think

236
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,440
about is you know if you go back a

237
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,360
couple hundred years you could read an

238
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,520
encyclopedia and have a pretty good

239
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,340
summary of you know what humans knew at

240
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,539
the time right I mean there's a lot of

241
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,640
nuance to that I get it

242
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,419
um

243
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,299
when I was growing up I'm 44 so I didn't

244
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:55,799
have the internet in my house when I was

245
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:57,120
in high school so we used to go use the

246
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,760
card catalog and do research that way

247
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,520
but I've always been a procrastinator

248
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,740
and I'm super lazy and the only

249
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,840
encyclopedia we had in our house was

250
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,580
decorative if it was a funk and wagonals

251
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,399
from like 1870 and so when I was really

252
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:12,960
late in assignment I would use that

253
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,600
stupid thing right and it was fine right

254
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,399
I mean you know nothing's changed from

255
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,100
1870 and now from you know the year the

256
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,179
country was founded or something like

257
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,440
that

258
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,940
um but back then I used to look at that

259
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,440
thing and just you'd read through it and

260
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,000
you could just really that's pretty much

261
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,380
what people knew right I mean you could

262
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,480
know all these different things

263
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,100
and in many ways I liken that to our

264
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,080
industry right you know a number of

265
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,640
years ago you could really be a

266
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,019
specialist in all these different things

267
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,940
and now it just feels like it's gotten

268
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,559
so big

269
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,620
um

270
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,940
kind of on a similar note

271
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,740
um on assessments years ago I used to

272
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,019
say that on the plane ride out you could

273
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:50,100
usually just about write the report

274
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,899
right 15 years ago because you knew

275
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:52,980
exactly what you're going to find right

276
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,840
every organization had the same problems

277
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,700
and that's very different now

278
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,019
um people have gotten much better at

279
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,059
that but it's something to think about

280
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,220
right especially as we you know for

281
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,899
anybody that's in school now think about

282
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:05,640
what you watch your career path to be

283
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,799
right and especially if it's highly

284
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,839
specialized on technology you know how

285
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,460
much work that's going to require over

286
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,139
the years to stay on top of it right if

287
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,119
you want to be a specialist in something

288
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,280
very specific it's a lot to keep track

289
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,119
of

290
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,679
um you know on the advisory side where I

291
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,260
work obviously regulations and things

292
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,240
like that are are similar in many ways

293
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,879
but to that end you know I think a lot

294
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:32,820
about you know what is our actual role

295
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,980
um you know is it to advise right that's

296
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,139
what I do a lot of I don't necessarily

297
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,940
you know plug things in or or make

298
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,500
changes but oftentimes give advice on

299
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,199
what to do or consult and make

300
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,699
recommendations

301
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,260
um testing I mean obviously that's a

302
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,639
huge topic uh you know a lot of people

303
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,719
that I talk to that's what their

304
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,899
interest is in they want to test things

305
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,760
in implementation

306
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,040
um and kind of moving towards you know

307
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,300
one of the things that we talk a lot

308
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,380
about

309
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,020
um is existence versus Effectiveness

310
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,480
right so how many controls do you have

311
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,400
you know what's in place what does your

312
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,280
program look like versus does it work

313
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,560
right so do I have a lock on my door yes

314
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,400
does it keep anybody out no

315
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,260
and are we equipped to you know kind of

316
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,480
build programs run programs you know

317
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,900
Implement tools run tools etc etc

318
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,040
and again you know we think about

319
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,380
specialization and how we're structuring

320
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,240
security at organizations that becomes

321
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,320
more and more important as a

322
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,800
consideration

323
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,579
another thing especially when I speak to

324
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,560
anybody at schools is to talk a lot

325
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,579
about

326
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:39,660
um kind of the information security

327
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,280
industry versus kind of what we think of

328
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,980
as hacking culture Etc et cetera and

329
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,140
kind of what we picture for that

330
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,420
um especially for kind of a career or a

331
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,099
future role

332
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,900
um you know I love working in in

333
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,040
governance

334
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,480
um you know I like to joke that you know

335
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,920
there's never a governance emergency

336
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,980
right like we have a whole incident

337
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,060
response team

338
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,280
and as we know they're busiest around

339
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,079
holidays right because that's when a lot

340
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,060
of this stuff happens no one has ever

341
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,619
called me at two in the morning and

342
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,700
asked me to write a policy

343
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,020
okay zero laughs I got like one laugh

344
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,359
out of that like I like these test jokes

345
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,640
and if nobody laughs and I kind of know

346
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,579
like what I'm dealing with my usual one

347
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,380
is we talk about like the cloud and I

348
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,380
say like it's a nebulous concept

349
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,380
nothing it's a good dad joke and you can

350
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,700
tell who took Latin right when they were

351
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,020
younger too right

352
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,000
um but anyway if that joke doesn't work

353
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,440
then I just kind of roll like it's

354
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,480
whatever we're good and if people laugh

355
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,040
at that then you'll get you'll get all

356
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,440
of me so

357
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,240
right that's just how it is

358
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,619
but it's something that I think about

359
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,359
you know is that

360
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,099
you know there's there's a lot of

361
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,020
culture and um camaraderie and other

362
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,520
things and a lot of parts of our

363
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,440
industry but there's not necessarily

364
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,720
like a like a GRC scene right there

365
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,520
aren't people that are um you know you

366
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,900
don't see like a lot of like cool

367
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,480
sweatshirts with like you know policy

368
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,400
development on it right

369
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,800
um but for anybody going into the

370
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,880
industry or thinking about the industry

371
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,020
for me it's been a um a very uh

372
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,700
rewarding

373
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,160
um thing to do I love what I do

374
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,760
um

375
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,099
people mock me um they said um you know

376
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,300
that I'm the youngest person they've

377
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,119
ever met in GRC which is not as true now

378
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,920
that's true 15 years ago

379
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,980
um

380
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,720
there's that work

381
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,420
but we start to think about security as

382
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,420
a function right and you know you can

383
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,220
get a hundred different definitions of

384
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,660
information security right you ever do

385
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,980
that like you know you go look it up I

386
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,780
was actually looking it up there's like

387
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,599
50 different definitions so just insert

388
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,520
your own in your mind right so whatever

389
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,380
you're thinking the definition is it's

390
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,579
that that's what it is that's what we're

391
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,680
going to use that and that's fine

392
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,839
but then we start to think about where

393
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,760
does information security sit you know

394
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,079
and it's obviously starting to blend

395
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,700
more and more into privacy and some

396
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,740
other things

397
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,359
but is it a function of risk management

398
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,920
right we hear a lot of people say that

399
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,380
security is just risk management or

400
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,420
doesn't become a business function you

401
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,760
know especially when you talk about

402
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,740
um you know if you're working in the

403
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,140
industry now how often do you deal with

404
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,300
these third-party risk assessments where

405
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,920
your your customers and your clients are

406
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,300
sending these big spreadsheets that's

407
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,400
about your security controls right all

408
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,500
day long and so in that sense you know

409
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,180
security is oftentimes a business

410
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,380
function right having that stuff in

411
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,420
place versus a technical discipline

412
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,260
um

413
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,400
and one of the things that I always

414
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,280
think about is that if all of us who

415
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,900
obviously have an interest in the

416
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,579
industry and in this topic you know

417
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,040
debate these things then how how are

418
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,540
people outside of the industry ever

419
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,460
going to get a handle on it and how are

420
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,560
we able to communicate what it should

421
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,339
look like to the rest of the

422
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,380
organization the other thing that's so

423
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,380
challenging is security is so different

424
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,480
at different organizations

425
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,800
um I'm not going to call anybody out but

426
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,839
I see some yawns so if you want me to

427
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,079
spice things up just like give it a

428
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,660
give it away we're good spice it up

429
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,460
let's spice it up let's do it all right

430
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,140
but

431
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,060
um but the other pieces is security is

432
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,380
so different in different organizations

433
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,720
right so like what's going to work at a

434
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,880
you know a Fortune 100 is going to be

435
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,260
very different than what's going to work

436
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,680
at a 50 person shop right and the issue

437
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,660
is that oftentimes they have to meet the

438
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,060
same requirements right I mean just your

439
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,500
data isn't more secure because you're at

440
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,579
a small company and you don't have the

441
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,200
resources to protect it

442
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,119
so again as we just kind of think

443
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,300
through where security is going to sit

444
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,400
um in the organization and overall as an

445
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,480
industry

446
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,740
um those are just things I think we need

447
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,040
to think about

448
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,140
so I'm not good at I.T at a whole just

449
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,440
FYI like so I I'm doing my best with the

450
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,200
PowerPoint but it gets me every time I

451
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,099
um

452
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,680
my wife so my wife so my wife and I

453
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,079
value education like a lot so we have

454
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,060
two master's degrees between us

455
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,020
but they're both hers

456
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,400
telling a story earlier you know during

457
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,599
the pandemic because I gave a lot of

458
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,760
presentations with zoom and whatnot the

459
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,560
number of times I'm like frantically

460
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,119
like trying to text her from my office

461
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,740
like run down and help me figure out how

462
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,839
to get the screens to work is very high

463
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:14,820
or if my kid in the summer if my kids

464
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,619
are home like my 11 year old or my 15

465
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,839
year old they if they were here right

466
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:20,460
now we'd be having zero technical issues

467
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,040
I can promise you that

468
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
we start to think about you know again

469
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,180
security is a specialization but

470
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,520
really it crossed over into so many

471
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,880
other functions right and you know like

472
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,380
who's going to eat your lunch right is

473
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,540
that is that a cool thing to say is that

474
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,800
kind of stupid

475
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,760
probably it's stupid I get it all right

476
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,079
but you start to think about it right

477
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,119
like if you work in security how much

478
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,619
time do you spend working with the legal

479
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,540
department right because here's my thing

480
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,640
I've been doing security for a long time

481
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,780
I've been doing compliance for a long

482
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,420
time an advisory I'm not a lawyer right

483
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,280
I don't you know so you we need to work

484
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,140
with legal departments to interpret what

485
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,180
the law says and then help them meet

486
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,820
requirements around it right

487
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,460
um you know it's kind of like it's like

488
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,140
I'm not an accountant I mean I can do

489
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,640
your taxes as well go to jail but I can

490
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,200
do your taxes

491
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,180
um but you know or privacy you know

492
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,339
privacy is continued to grow right so we

493
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,020
see a lot of standards and requirements

494
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,780
around privacy and things that are

495
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,880
really overlapping with security

496
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,839
um and that's obviously the kind of

497
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,480
Confluence of legal and privacy and also

498
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,880
audit right you know security so often

499
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,380
as an audit function

500
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,300
um I like to joke that I I love it

501
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,060
auditor so much I married one

502
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,160
that that show goes really over really

503
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,900
well like Issa or soccer like the

504
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,820
auditing groups but here here I kind of

505
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,460
bombed but

506
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,079
you know so a lot of things that we do

507
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,700
traditionally you know are we there to

508
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,260
check things or are they there to

509
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,119
provide guidance

510
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,640
in finance even right so Finance they're

511
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,900
oftentimes coming to us with these

512
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,040
requirements

513
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,400
um or general I.T right because again so

514
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,079
many of the rules and functions that I

515
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,640
think we've traditionally thought of as

516
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,280
security really are often as better

517
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,020
suited to Sid in other parts of I.T

518
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,640
right it's it's

519
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,020
um kind of better way to kind of spread

520
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,460
things out and IT addresses the Staffing

521
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,720
problem

522
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,300
of course procurement right so we spend

523
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,220
a lot of time again as organizations

524
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,260
dealing with third parties because

525
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,960
there's so much risk there right if you

526
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,339
look at a lot of the big stories over

527
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,079
the years you know you'll read you know

528
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,700
big company hacked right that's the

529
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,800
headline but the fifth paragraph is like

530
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,180
well it actually was a service provider

531
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,500
right it was actually some marketing

532
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,880
company they used that had their data or

533
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,520
whatever it is so procurement has really

534
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,839
been kind of moving into the security

535
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,880
space as well

536
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,599
um

537
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,700
and so we'll see where it goes but again

538
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,200
I just think that the way the industry

539
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,640
is structured and the challenges that

540
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,160
we're having is going to lead to us uh

541
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,359
continuing to move a lot more of this

542
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,520
stuff to General I.T with our oversight

543
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,720
so another piece is

544
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,000
educating everyone it's kind of funny

545
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,040
because everybody always says security

546
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,020
is everyone's responsibility I mean it's

547
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,520
true right

548
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,260
um but it's not what they're going to

549
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,819
think about all day

550
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,440
you know I actually

551
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,280
um because I'm older so in my day you

552
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,060
know there weren't like information

553
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,040
security degrees right so I have a

554
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,420
finance degree

555
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,079
um

556
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,520
and so I think about that like I don't

557
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,839
know anything about like I mean I took

558
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,819
all these accounting classes but I don't

559
00:43:17,819 --> 00:43:19,500
know the ins and outs of accounting so

560
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,060
why would I expect accounting to know

561
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,980
the ins and outs of security right so we

562
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,740
have to help them and and um educate

563
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,060
them and this is going to lead us right

564
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,200
into our next slide we're getting to a

565
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,740
point I promise

566
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,260
but you always hear the example everyone

567
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,819
talks about like sales or accounting

568
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:38,579
they always pick is like the example

569
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:39,720
um you know that it's not necessarily

570
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,400
hackers it'll get you it's the you know

571
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,079
Bob in accounting

572
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,839
but again I think it's always if

573
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,579
somebody can take down your whole

574
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:49,560
multi-billion dollar Company by clicking

575
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,060
on one thing

576
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,920
maybe that's a problem right maybe

577
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,020
that's that's not their fault on some

578
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,880
level right you know if you think about

579
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,280
it if you you know use Vehicles as part

580
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,440
of your job you know it's my it's my job

581
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,880
absolutely to know the laws and follow

582
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,619
the rules and you'll be able to fill the

583
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:06,060
thing with gas but I don't need to know

584
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,040
how to rebuild the motor right I don't

585
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,300
even need to know how to change the oil

586
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,880
right as a user you know so where do we

587
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,839
start to draw those lines

588
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,680
there goes

589
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,359
another piece I think that said that's

590
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,160
incredibly important

591
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,859
um is understanding the business

592
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:27,599
I've talked to a lot of people that I

593
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,380
know

594
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,180
um because just working in this industry

595
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,380
a lot of your friends tend to be people

596
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,720
that work in the industry and oftentimes

597
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,240
we'll hear just these stories

598
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,859
um and they're always told with just a

599
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:40,200
ton a ton of flourish about breaking

600
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,359
into some system or whatever

601
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,220
um I remember years ago I was at a

602
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,900
conference and everyone's gathered

603
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,220
around this one person that was telling

604
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,020
a story about like hacking something

605
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,060
and it I mean it was amazing like the

606
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,500
this person should be in movies the way

607
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,700
they tell stories

608
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,560
but at the end I was like oh that's

609
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,119
really cool I was like so you know what

610
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,859
was on that system I was like oh it was

611
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,240
for it was actually for a parking gate

612
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,800
in a parking garage

613
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,060
it's like oh it's like it was at a

614
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,220
hospital I'm like oh okay I'm like so so

615
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,960
what could you see like what do you mean

616
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,220
I'm like well could you could you see

617
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,680
the credit card data on there no

618
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,359
what could you see like maybe who was

619
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,099
coming and going because maybe I guess

620
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:15,960
you could use that somehow I was like no

621
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,520
it's like well what could you see it's

622
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,780
like well I could see what time the gate

623
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,020
went up and what time the gate went down

624
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,660
like all right I mean but my point being

625
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,420
is you know that's obviously you want to

626
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,579
fix that flaw but how does that affect

627
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,140
the business right

628
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,859
um

629
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:34,260
and what's really you know been

630
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,880
interesting over kind of the time that

631
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,740
I've been in the industry is people used

632
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,880
to always joke about security was always

633
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,160
going to say no to stuff right and

634
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,480
here's the thing

635
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,460
like if a company has an opportunity to

636
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,960
make a ton of money on some new product

637
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,119
or whatever and Security's like no we

638
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,319
can't do that what are they going to do

639
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,000
we're gonna make the product right so we

640
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,640
want to just make sure that we're giving

641
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,980
the message in such a way that you know

642
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,300
we're helping them you're helping to

643
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,880
lower risk and make things better

644
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,140
um you know another thing that I've just

645
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,760
noticed across the industry is people

646
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,280
want to get to zero risk well there's no

647
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,020
zero risk right I mean how did everybody

648
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,819
get here I'm guessing some people

649
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,560
probably walked which I guess could be

650
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,819
dangerous with the ice but most people

651
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,800
drive right driving is one of the most

652
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,839
dangerous things that you can do

653
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,760
um for any of us but we still do it

654
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,079
right so we're always going to have risk

655
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,760
in the things that we do

656
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,099
and so

657
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:24,599
a lot of times what I'll see is people

658
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,760
that want to get to zero risk and then

659
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,020
nobody wants to listen to them because

660
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,339
you're never going to get to zero risk

661
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:30,540
right it's making sure you get to

662
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,300
acceptable risk or understand the risk

663
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,300
um Etc because we're not the FAA

664
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,980
um although that's become a really bad

665
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,540
example lately with all these like near

666
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,180
misses but traditionally you know the

667
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,560
FAA was just such a fascinating

668
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,480
organization because they really did

669
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,300
work to get to zero risk when I was a

670
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,859
kid

671
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:51,900
stupid touchscreen all right when I was

672
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,460
a kid you know my dad used to travel a

673
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,619
lot he'd go to Europe and planes would

674
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:57,599
like crash like it was a thing right I

675
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:58,800
mean you remember that in the 90s so

676
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,079
there would be plane crashes and I used

677
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,880
to worry when he traveled and these days

678
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,440
like my kids don't even understand that

679
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,599
as a risk right I mean when was the last

680
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,099
domestic plane crash it just doesn't

681
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,319
happen and it's because the FAA I mean

682
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,579
if a plane crashes in the middle of the

683
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,319
ocean they will use submarines and bring

684
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:14,819
up all the parts and reassemble the

685
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:17,099
thing in a warehouse and then fix it on

686
00:47:17,099 --> 00:47:18,420
every single plane out there right I

687
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,099
mean but that's just not how most of

688
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:22,200
Life Works getting to zero risk

689
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,359
so it's really just understanding you

690
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:26,099
know how we can lower that risk and help

691
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:27,720
organizations do that

692
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,380
um

693
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,480
and when security really understands the

694
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,280
business and what's what its goals are

695
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,619
and can help them meet them

696
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,119
it's going to be much better integrated

697
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,740
into the organization

698
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,359
um and and really Auditors and

699
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:40,500
Regulators can be your best friends

700
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,660
right because they can help you

701
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,099
um you know one of my favorite stories

702
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,780
is I work with a pretty large company

703
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,319
years ago and I went out to visit them

704
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,420
and they were super excited to see me

705
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,980
um which almost makes you feel good

706
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,780
because I like that you know I think I'm

707
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,400
fun but I was like oh why are they so

708
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,540
excited to see me and then well they

709
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,819
just got an audit report and they didn't

710
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,319
understand what was in it like what do

711
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,540
they want us to do I'm like well where

712
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,560
are they they're like well they're a

713
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,140
floor above us like let's go ask him

714
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,420
right so we go up there and like we just

715
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,500
talk to the audit team about what

716
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,640
they're looking for and what's going to

717
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,380
meet the requirements and you know what

718
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,300
the issues are and like everyone was

719
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,740
like so excited like I was a hero I

720
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,180
didn't do anything I was just to go talk

721
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,319
to the people that give you the audit

722
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,900
report right um and and so that's my

723
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,760
thing right so talking to Auditors

724
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,020
talking to people who have stakes in

725
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,099
this is super important

726
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,720
so another piece that I would like to

727
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,520
bring up so what is that so my kids like

728
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,780
these would you rather books you ever

729
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,140
seen those

730
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,220
drink a gallon of ranch dressing or

731
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,720
drink a gallon of ketchup

732
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,460
my kids get so max I'm like I'm not

733
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,599
doing either

734
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:43,920
like well you have to pick one I'm like

735
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,000
no I don't

736
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,859
I'm six foot three and you're like three

737
00:48:46,859 --> 00:48:48,420
feet tall I'm not I'm not doing either

738
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,980
like how are you gonna make me do that

739
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,099
but the point is right is that in life

740
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:55,740
though we have to make choices

741
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,280
and if somebody comes to you and says

742
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,920
would you rather pay for a software

743
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,180
security team

744
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,640
or work to get your developers to write

745
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,800
better code right so would you rather

746
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,300
have two extra developers and have all

747
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,040
your developers be running secure stuff

748
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,119
or would you rather add a bunch of

749
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,380
people later in the process to do

750
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,359
security well for most companies you

751
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,500
know the answer is oftentimes going to

752
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,720
be more developers right they can they

753
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,040
can do these things

754
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,040
um

755
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,780
and again especially now in today's

756
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,579
economic climate and as hard as it is to

757
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:27,720
find people I think that's going to

758
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:30,660
continue right and this is going to be

759
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,760
especially more true for these

760
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,680
specialized roles right things that are

761
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,839
are still defined as security functions

762
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,160
even though they're probably better

763
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,280
suited as general i t functions

764
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,560
like the example I used earlier you know

765
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,359
is a firewall admin or somebody that

766
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,500
does iam

767
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,819
like how would you count that in your

768
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,319
security spend

769
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,119
right because that's a question I get

770
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,680
asked all the time right it's like well

771
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,839
what percent of my it budget should be

772
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:56,160
security

773
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,540
I don't know unless you tell me how

774
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,880
you're defining security right I just I

775
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,440
don't know because it's you know as a

776
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,480
part of this ftes the whole FTE whatever

777
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,400
else whatever it is there's some things

778
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,839
that are very obvious

779
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,579
um you know if I'm buying product X then

780
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:09,540
I have to have any way to run the

781
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,819
company and the more secure version is

782
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:14,520
10 more so what is the security spend 10

783
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,800
that 10 is the whole thing or whatever I

784
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,180
just you know it's just it's a challenge

785
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,160
that we run into

786
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,599
um

787
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,900
but just as we continue to to mature the

788
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,880
industry and and see these organizations

789
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,800
you know is going to be thinking about

790
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,480
you know where these different roles and

791
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,319
functions are sitting

792
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,240
another piece to think about is you know

793
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,920
our reporting structures

794
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,599
um how often how often do you hear

795
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,640
security should not report to it

796
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,400
right that's a pretty common refrain and

797
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,780
just over the years there's some very

798
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,819
clear examples of that you know if you

799
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:51,240
have um like real world situations that

800
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,980
you kind of modify to be able to speak

801
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:56,099
about is you know the I the head of I.T

802
00:50:56,099 --> 00:50:58,500
is incentivized with a bonus to ship a

803
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,400
product

804
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,859
and it's an insecure product and so

805
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:03,300
security is like well you shouldn't ship

806
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,040
it well if security reports to I.T what

807
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,780
happens

808
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:08,460
probably get shipped right

809
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,520
um

810
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,020
but does that necessarily make sense for

811
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,000
technical Implement implementation roles

812
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,740
right so if you're out there configuring

813
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,599
firewalls or you know doing IAM

814
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,040
functions does that make sense to sit

815
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,900
outside of I.T

816
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,000
um or is this only does this only become

817
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,579
true if information security becomes a

818
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,619
true governance and kind of advising and

819
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:30,240
risk management role

820
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,980
and you start to think of security

821
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,319
moving over into again that more

822
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,000
governance Rule and then the

823
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,559
implementation becoming more of an I.T

824
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:38,940
function

825
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,380
does that sound ridiculous anybody does

826
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,839
that make some sense

827
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:47,960
nobody cares okay all right

828
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,760
so the comment was around

829
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,680
um uh ISO and that and just how the

830
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,880
different you know categories and

831
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,800
functions all work together and I'm

832
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,059
right with you

833
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:08,640
um I have uh I have a lot of thoughts

834
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,800
about different standards and Frameworks

835
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,900
um my overarching one because you don't

836
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,220
want to hear me ramble about Frameworks

837
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,780
for like eight or ten hours

838
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,599
uh is generally the biggest issue that

839
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:19,980
we run into

840
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,480
um I don't mean we as a company but just

841
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,400
we as an industry is that people will

842
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,780
oftentimes take these Frameworks or

843
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,700
standards and want to use every part of

844
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,619
it right so like the new cyber security

845
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:31,200
framework it's great but the subtitle is

846
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,400
what for critical infrastructure

847
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,920
production and so it's a great it's a

848
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,260
great way to structure a program but it

849
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,359
may not apply every part of it may not

850
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,760
apply to you if you're making t-shirts

851
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,859
right it might be different if you are

852
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,900
critical infrastructure Etc so that's

853
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,040
one of the things too is to kind of pick

854
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,359
and choose

855
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:49,859
um where where possible not you have to

856
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:50,940
comply you know with these different

857
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,020
Frameworks and standards

858
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,460
we could pivot we could talk about ISO

859
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,200
and nist all day

860
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,119
that's my thing I'm telling you no

861
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,339
nobody wants to do that

862
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,640
I'll do it we can um after this if you

863
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,079
want my card like anybody I'll talk

864
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,880
about Nissan ISO all day it's cool I'm

865
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,780
gonna try to sell you anything we'll

866
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:15,260
just talk about it

867
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,339
but I think you know with everything

868
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:19,680
that we've talked about is that this

869
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,420
decision's gonna be made for us right it

870
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,859
doesn't matter what we want or what we

871
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:23,640
think

872
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,280
because we can't necessarily find the

873
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,140
people that we're looking for

874
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,240
um anyway and again just especially with

875
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,920
all the specialization

876
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,900
um you know like I mentioned when

877
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,700
recruiters are out there looking to find

878
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,680
people they're never looking you know

879
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,599
you know or they're often I was not

880
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,160
looking for these very specific roles in

881
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,420
most situations

882
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,339
the vast number of them and maybe

883
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:45,720
because I work an advisory and that's

884
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,520
just who calls me but they really are

885
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,160
looking for somebody to do everything

886
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,720
it's like that's cool like if I could do

887
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,579
every single thing that you listed in

888
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:54,900
this call you know in this email you

889
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,940
sent me I probably Drive in a Ferrari

890
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:59,220
right I wouldn't be driving my my Toyota

891
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,960
product right

892
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,819
um

893
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,680
and even if you are able to find people

894
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,000
you know what a budgets look like

895
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,079
because that's another thing that we're

896
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,400
kind of seeing is you know budgets are

897
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,380
changing right and the kind of wild west

898
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,359
of you know security spending is you

899
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,520
know seemingly contract in a lot of ways

900
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,800
and even determining like what skill

901
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,599
sets we need you know is not necessarily

902
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,520
something that or they start really

903
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,900
thinking about it tends to be more

904
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,599
reactive than you know proactive

905
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:25,980
um

906
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,240
and the other thing that we see I think

907
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,640
too is a lot of duplicative roles

908
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,440
and again that that comes down to a lot

909
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,079
of the the very technological things

910
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,900
but the big one is is that third parties

911
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,859
are going to continue to tell us what we

912
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:40,680
have to do right and oftentimes when we

913
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,140
think about you know requirements we

914
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,180
look at laws and regulations and

915
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,819
standards and everything like that but

916
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,559
one of the biggest ones people forget is

917
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,780
contracts right so other organizations

918
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,420
requiring us to do stuff right and

919
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,619
what's interesting about that is it

920
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:57,240
won't always really be something that

921
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,559
technically should apply to you right

922
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,880
but that you still have to comply with

923
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,280
it just because that's their rule so

924
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,540
again I think we're gonna we're gonna

925
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,920
continue to be told what we're going to

926
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,720
be doing

927
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,359
now again always to bring it back around

928
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,000
I work in Consulting right so I pay my

929
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,859
mortgage because people use third

930
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,140
parties right if they people didn't use

931
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,720
third parties then I I have to go work

932
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,280
somewhere else right so I want to be

933
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,780
really clear about that you know if I'm

934
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,220
standing up here and I tell you how

935
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,720
great you know tomatoes are for your

936
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,700
health that's cool but you should know

937
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,460
if I'm a Toyota farmer right it's fair

938
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,359
um

939
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:32,940
but I do think the key becomes you know

940
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,240
what to keep in-house and what not to

941
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,319
keep in-house you know what are the

942
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:38,520
things that we can Outsource or things

943
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,780
that we can use very specialized

944
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,220
services for

945
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,780
um

946
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,099
and what are we going to do ourselves

947
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,400
and uh you know what are what's going to

948
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,579
be different in every organization

949
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,260
so Mike is leaving because he's giving a

950
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,579
presentation next

951
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:57,240
not because he's bored

952
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,680
oh I don't want to be like the first one

953
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,880
to leave and then everyone else's life

954
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,740
leaves too it's like a party right yeah

955
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:04,500
we're all out right

956
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,559
um

957
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,300
but when we start to think about like

958
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,240
what to bring in house and what to you

959
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,260
know Outsource or what to use

960
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,119
specialized third parties for

961
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,099
um you know it really does depend on the

962
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:18,540
organization and its function you know

963
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,339
think about a manufacturer versus a

964
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:21,680
software company

965
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,119
manufacturing is fascinating to me

966
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:26,760
because again I used to almost use it as

967
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,619
an interview question like 10 or 15

968
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:29,880
years ago

969
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,920
um is I would say if you were to walk

970
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,540
into a manufacturer

971
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,420
that has zero compliance requirements

972
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,819
zero customer data zero credit cards

973
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:41,040
nothing else how would you sell them on

974
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,020
the need for a security program right

975
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,099
and that's like one of the hardest

976
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:46,020
questions ever right I mean it was maybe

977
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,020
you could you know back then it's um you

978
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,400
know maybe you could sell them on the

979
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,859
availability piece or what have you

980
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:54,119
um but it was just a much different

981
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,339
thing but now everything's connected

982
00:56:56,339 --> 00:56:58,800
right it's all this iot every single

983
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,780
thing is connected to everything else

984
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,700
um and so it's much different but their

985
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,980
needs are going to be much different

986
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,119
um

987
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:07,559
I also everybody ever seen the movie

988
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,240
Tommy Boy

989
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,680
probably one of the greatest pieces of

990
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,359
Cinema in history

991
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:14,160
but it's fascinating right because when

992
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,380
they wanna when they want to destroy the

993
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,520
company what do they do they don't

994
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,319
delete their records They just change

995
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:21,359
everything right so they don't just burn

996
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,579
all that paper they change it so all of

997
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:24,420
a sudden the brake pads that are

998
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,619
supposed to go to Peoria or go to

999
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,720
Cleveland and whatever else so you know

1000
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,339
that's another thing that obviously you

1001
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:30,240
know a lot of those companies are

1002
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,099
concerned about is not just the the

1003
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:34,020
availability but also you know the

1004
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,540
accuracy of that data

1005
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,520
but even in the sense you know when you

1006
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,200
talk about Outsourcing and again I

1007
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,819
always want to specify like I work for

1008
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:43,440
organization that has an IR team so I

1009
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,760
want to be really clear that I'm not

1010
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,800
here selling you anything this is what I

1011
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,680
think right this is uh um but I'm

1012
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,000
talking about like even internal IR

1013
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
plans right like what does it make sense

1014
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,980
for most organizations to have an expert

1015
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,660
in forensic technology

1016
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,760
or malware reversing or whatever else it

1017
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,099
is a bigger company sure right but those

1018
00:58:02,099 --> 00:58:03,780
are things that oftentimes you know are

1019
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,280
better outsourced um you know it's

1020
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,599
better to have some kind of flow chart

1021
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:08,160
where there are things that we know we

1022
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,540
can do internally on day-to-day stuff

1023
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:10,859
you know and when do we pull the rip

1024
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:12,180
cord

1025
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:12,900
um

1026
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,640
or at what point does a company become

1027
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,400
big enough to have a red team right or

1028
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,720
or any of those things and that's

1029
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,520
obviously Up For Debate and it has to do

1030
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,339
you know with complexity as well

1031
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:25,740
um but also you know I think the other

1032
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,059
piece that's going to become extremely

1033
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:28,619
important is this third party risk

1034
00:58:28,619 --> 00:58:29,460
management

1035
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,920
right because again everywhere I go

1036
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,099
everybody I ever talk to one of their

1037
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:36,599
biggest issues are all these vendor

1038
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:37,859
questionnaires right it's all this

1039
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:39,299
third-party risk management it's all

1040
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:40,619
they're just getting hammered with it

1041
00:58:40,619 --> 00:58:41,760
every day

1042
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,980
and what's fascinating to me is

1043
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,559
sometimes even at Giant companies you

1044
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,180
can go talk to a giant company with

1045
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,799
thousands of vendors and they'll have

1046
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:51,059
like three or four people doing

1047
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:52,619
third-party risk management

1048
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:54,599
right um so I think that's something

1049
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,760
that's going to continue to grow

1050
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,140
um and it's going to be kind of

1051
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,819
interesting so that right there that was

1052
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:01,799
my quick anecdote

1053
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:04,740
you can see my screen

1054
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,079
but I think as we continue to look at

1055
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:09,420
um distributed security functions you

1056
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,500
know it's going to continue to really be

1057
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,059
outcome based

1058
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:13,859
because again all that has what we see

1059
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:15,660
with programs is very reactive rather

1060
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,740
than you know building for the future

1061
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,780
orientation anticipating what the issues

1062
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,799
are going to be

1063
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:21,119
and looking at what we want to

1064
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,740
accomplish and you know what are our end

1065
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,760
goals

1066
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,660
um

1067
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,339
and other piece is who's determine the

1068
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:28,260
end goal right because how often times

1069
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,119
in organizations do you see risks or

1070
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:31,920
issues being accepted at a certain level

1071
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,720
of the organization that the board would

1072
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,000
never accept they knew about

1073
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,260
so really pulling everything together

1074
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,059
and making sure everyone is working

1075
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:41,040
together to understand what our desired

1076
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,200
outcomes need to be and should be and

1077
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,098
how we're going to get there together

1078
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,599
oh that didn't work hard there is

1079
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,940
and again another thing um I always say

1080
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,020
that we'll never be out of work in this

1081
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,400
industry because everything changes so

1082
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,559
quickly right like it seems like every

1083
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,140
few years like you see a story that's

1084
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,460
like oh they're fixing the password

1085
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,200
issue or they're building like the most

1086
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,819
secure thing ever I'm like oh man what

1087
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:07,440
are we gonna do for work

1088
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,920
right you ever see those and okay but

1089
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,480
you always see those I'm like okay what

1090
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,040
like what am I gonna do because I'm not

1091
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,319
like I don't know what I would do when I

1092
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:17,819
was in school in the summertime I used

1093
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,079
to work on a golf course and I mowed

1094
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:21,000
lawn some of the grains and stuff I had

1095
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,619
to be there at like 5 30. it was the

1096
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,480
greatest thing ever right if every job

1097
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,460
paid the exact same amount that's what I

1098
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,700
would do right so if we solve the

1099
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,900
security problem that's cool I'm gonna

1100
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,700
go do that okay I'm gonna go I'm gonna

1101
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,079
go back to the golf course

1102
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:34,740
um

1103
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,140
but it's just amazing because every time

1104
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:38,940
you think maybe things are going to get

1105
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,079
better and they're going to need less of

1106
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:40,799
us

1107
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,599
um something new comes out right it used

1108
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,760
to be that we focus so much on building

1109
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,559
walls around everything and okay things

1110
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,940
are getting more secure and then all of

1111
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,200
a sudden everybody's sharing data

1112
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,700
everywhere all the time with everyone so

1113
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,680
okay I guess they need to see it

1114
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,240
um

1115
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,040
but if you look at you know a lot of

1116
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,359
organizations

1117
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,140
um

1118
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,480
if you look at you know

1119
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,839
software as a service the cloud right

1120
01:01:02,839 --> 01:01:05,760
platform is a service everything else

1121
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,200
Etc as a service

1122
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,119
is that funny is that funny

1123
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:11,400
okay that because I got like three

1124
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,200
things that were funny so far

1125
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,020
maybe four depending all right

1126
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,760
I'll keep trying

1127
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,740
you miss 100 of the shots you don't take

1128
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,240
according to Michael Scott quoting Wayne

1129
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,920
Gretzky

1130
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,780
there's five all right

1131
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,440
um

1132
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,180
but no I think that's a model that we're

1133
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,380
starting to see right because a lot of

1134
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,819
organizations that we saw throughout the

1135
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:30,960
years you know were very good at

1136
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,180
applying policies and procedures and

1137
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,339
everything else to on-prem but then they

1138
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:36,540
move stuff to the cloud and I'm not

1139
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,520
saying the cloud breaks but all the

1140
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,720
policy procedures they developed over

1141
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,460
the years suddenly no longer quite work

1142
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,740
or quite fit with what they're doing you

1143
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,299
know in the cloud and so now they're not

1144
01:01:45,299 --> 01:01:47,280
following their own policies and the

1145
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,720
model there you when you go to

1146
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,859
organizations

1147
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:51,780
um you'll oftentimes see a ton of

1148
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,520
contractor badges they're everywhere

1149
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,380
because they bring in so much

1150
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,960
Professional Services to do all this and

1151
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,980
I think that's probably going to be a

1152
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,480
continued model for security right I

1153
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,319
think a lot of security is going to

1154
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:03,720
continue to be Professional Services

1155
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,099
um also keep in mind that the same

1156
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:06,599
security structure is not going to work

1157
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:07,920
everywhere it's not going to be the same

1158
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:10,500
thing everywhere and I really think it's

1159
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,540
going to be a fundamental um you know

1160
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,619
shift in just how we think about

1161
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:15,119
security and how we're implementing

1162
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,780
security and and maintaining it and I

1163
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:19,859
think especially for anyone in the room

1164
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:21,240
that's a student you know you're going

1165
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,980
to see that over your career it's going

1166
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,540
to be very different I think that we're

1167
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,339
kind of at a point where you know things

1168
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:28,920
have kind of morphed over time but it

1169
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,540
feels like it's starting to accelerate a

1170
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,319
little bit

1171
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:32,780
um

1172
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,579
so with that I'll have some time for

1173
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:36,420
questions

1174
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,119
does anyone have any

1175
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,380
yes those are

1176
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,099
so the question was in kind of

1177
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:57,780
governance and GRC are there any skills

1178
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,880
that are more desirable you know for

1179
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,140
individuals that want to enter it or

1180
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,880
grow in it

1181
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,859
um so two things first of all grab my

1182
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:06,119
card after if you want because I'm

1183
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:07,859
always happy to talk to you about it

1184
01:03:07,859 --> 01:03:11,040
um you know my career throughout it both

1185
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,500
early on and you know every every step

1186
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,000
of it there have been so many people

1187
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,160
that help me and so I'm always happy to

1188
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,160
do the same and um but yes I think one

1189
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,900
thing that's so important is you know

1190
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,660
unless you go out and start your own

1191
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,059
company and everybody you know that you

1192
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:29,160
can't just tell people what to do right

1193
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,079
so I think in life and everything else

1194
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:33,540
it becomes we need to learn how to you

1195
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,400
know make arguments and persuade and

1196
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,619
educate and inform rather than tell

1197
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:40,200
um because it's so I know that soft

1198
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,240
skills it's so obnoxious how much people

1199
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,460
talk about soft skills but it really is

1200
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:45,720
true right

1201
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,280
um and so I think especially in advisory

1202
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,319
roles it's extremely important

1203
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:50,940
um you know to be able to articulate

1204
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:52,440
messages well

1205
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,799
um to talk to people about the why and

1206
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:58,500
not just the what you know it's you know

1207
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,180
even if when we're talking to end users

1208
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,920
if you just tell people what they have

1209
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,020
to do I mean some number will do it

1210
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,240
maybe even begrudgingly but if you

1211
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,619
explain to people why it's important

1212
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:08,520
you're going to get a lot more

1213
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,099
compliance and I think in governance and

1214
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:12,960
an advisory that's extremely important

1215
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,339
as well right so making sure that we're

1216
01:04:14,339 --> 01:04:15,660
telling people why

1217
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,839
um and and you know that kind of thing I

1218
01:04:18,839 --> 01:04:20,339
know that's kind of broad

1219
01:04:20,339 --> 01:04:23,040
um and I don't answer your question

1220
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,079
the other piece is

1221
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:27,540
um from a more tactical perspective

1222
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,220
is you know if you're getting into

1223
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,720
compliance standards and everything else

1224
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,299
if you can really understand how they

1225
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:34,440
overlap

1226
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,720
that's a extremely important skill right

1227
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,280
so that you can help people in the sense

1228
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,680
of if you do these three things it's

1229
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,020
going to cover these parts of these you

1230
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,400
know standards if you those four things

1231
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,500
is going to cover these parts Etc so

1232
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,579
that instead of looking at every

1233
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:48,900
requirement

1234
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,819
um you know on its own you can see where

1235
01:04:50,819 --> 01:04:54,079
they overlap and do things once

1236
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,520
but as I said I'm gonna be completely

1237
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,859
open with you like I don't I give a lot

1238
01:04:58,859 --> 01:05:00,299
of presentations and I don't get a lot

1239
01:05:00,299 --> 01:05:01,559
of people asking about about how to get

1240
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:04,020
into GRC so call me anytime and we'll

1241
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:06,420
talk about it and yes I will anything

1242
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,900
you need

1243
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,280
they do

1244
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,440
I'm so I mean as I said I I love

1245
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,700
advisory

1246
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,980
um and and again it's just I joke that

1247
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,380
it's like the Dermatology of information

1248
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,079
security and not in like in in the and

1249
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,579
I'm talking about the schedule because

1250
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:24,960
again right if you're going to be a

1251
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,000
doctor like Dermatology is the way to go

1252
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,059
for two reasons right one is they do

1253
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,740
procedures right and procedures where

1254
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:32,880
you make all the money

1255
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,500
and the second piece is there just

1256
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,299
aren't emergencies like I said I mean

1257
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:37,680
there's not like a dermatologist on call

1258
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,900
you know like on a on a holiday at three

1259
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:40,920
in the morning you're not running you

1260
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,880
know you're not flying into the hospital

1261
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,299
to you know do something right so same

1262
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:47,099
thing with GRC and advisory

1263
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:48,960
and it's Contin it's grow and it's grow

1264
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,640
so much

1265
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,299
um

1266
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:52,859
because you know what organization is

1267
01:05:52,859 --> 01:05:54,420
never going to get smaller

1268
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,339
government right who makes laws and

1269
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:58,380
regulations there you go so it's just

1270
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,059
but I really think especially if you

1271
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:03,839
look at kind of how few you know um

1272
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,460
regulations there have been I mean at

1273
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,420
some point they're going to be you know

1274
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,280
they're gonna probably uh the Dam's

1275
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,839
going to break so I think we'll always

1276
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,460
be in demand for those things

1277
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,180
um

1278
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,500
the other thing is I think is making

1279
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,880
sure you know how to work with like

1280
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,140
legal legal teams

1281
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,140
so the question was around you know

1282
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,000
where my security reports to and you

1283
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,859
know can it report somewhere aside from

1284
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:03,420
it

1285
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,859
um without kind of somebody having that

1286
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:06,420
specialized I.T knowledge that summarize

1287
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,520
it pretty well and and kind of what

1288
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,260
we're seeing out there and the answer is

1289
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,660
we're seeing everything right so again

1290
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,099
just because you know I think

1291
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:15,660
information security is still very new

1292
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,700
as a industry and as a role and

1293
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,280
everything else you know and and you

1294
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,440
know it hasn't helped um that there are

1295
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,780
a lot of regulations out there that now

1296
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:27,720
require organs have a name CSO right and

1297
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,339
so oftentimes I'll just toss that on

1298
01:07:29,339 --> 01:07:31,319
somebody right it's not necessarily A

1299
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:32,819
Defined role so somebody has to sign off

1300
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:34,559
that they're doing it so I think the

1301
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,839
thing is is always backing up and

1302
01:07:36,839 --> 01:07:39,059
determining like what the head of

1303
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:42,000
security or CSO rule is you know is it a

1304
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,220
true board level position not not that

1305
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,020
commonly right

1306
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:46,859
um

1307
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:48,240
and whether it is you know somebody

1308
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,940
that's kind of the head of I.T security

1309
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,079
or is it someone that's you know more in

1310
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,119
a governance role and when it comes to

1311
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,099
highly regulated environments

1312
01:07:56,099 --> 01:07:58,559
um oftentimes you know what we think of

1313
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,119
or what I think of as security

1314
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:02,819
requirements from a more compliance or a

1315
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:05,099
regulatory standpoint ends up following

1316
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:07,200
to like the head of Enterprise risk who

1317
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,240
then kind of delegates it down to

1318
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,460
somebody in a more technical role so I

1319
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,960
know I'm not clearly answering your

1320
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,180
question but but the answer really is

1321
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,799
it's all over the place

1322
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,238
um the other thing is it oftentimes has

1323
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,679
a lot to do with internal politics and

1324
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,000
organizations

1325
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,020
um you know people don't want to have

1326
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,479
that move in different places or

1327
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:25,859
um you know things like that so there's

1328
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:26,819
not I don't necessarily have a clear

1329
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:28,620
answer for you except that we see it a

1330
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,479
ton of different ways

1331
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:31,859
um and just given how different

1332
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:33,960
organizations are there's not really one

1333
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,120
clear answer or clear way to do it

1334
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,979
did I answer your question

1335
01:08:37,979 --> 01:08:41,359
mostly 90 80 percent

1336
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,520
73.6 that's I graduated from high school

1337
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,698
with like a 2.3 so I'm on it

1338
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:49,198
yes

1339
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:53,000
so how would you go about it

1340
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,460
so the question was how would you kind

1341
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,160
of sell I would I would be very clear so

1342
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,040
so a mid-size Manufacturing Company

1343
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,299
security and I would be clear out

1344
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:16,738
selling them on the ideas different than

1345
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:18,540
me selling them security right because I

1346
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,219
always want to clarify and be honest

1347
01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:21,540
about what I do

1348
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,640
um on the idea of security it's become

1349
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,620
much easier to sell just based on

1350
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,600
availability right because things are so

1351
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,880
connected and if you look at

1352
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,620
um organizations and how long they can

1353
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,120
stop their line without going out of

1354
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,859
business you know is a pretty clear one

1355
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:37,620
the other one is as much as a lot of

1356
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,899
people hate regulations or hate GRC

1357
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:42,660
for security people I mean I loved it

1358
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,580
for years because it was the only reason

1359
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,799
a lot of people did stuff right if I

1360
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:47,880
come in there and try to explain to

1361
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,140
somebody why they need to do these

1362
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,640
things it's like get out of here Alex

1363
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,859
but if I come in here and say hey the

1364
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:54,480
regulation says you have to do this or

1365
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,739
if you want to take credit cards you

1366
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:58,380
have to do this my job's much easier so

1367
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,239
I think it depends um you know depending

1368
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,440
on what industry they're in you know

1369
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,460
there are certain regulations around

1370
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,620
manufacturing the other thing is that

1371
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,820
the manufacturing regulations are

1372
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:09,179
growing so you start to see um and sorry

1373
01:10:09,179 --> 01:10:11,040
I I don't want to get it wrong

1374
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,719
especially if this is recorded but I

1375
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:13,800
forget what it's called but like the

1376
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,340
like the the auto manufacturers

1377
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,360
Association or whatever it is you know

1378
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:21,120
starting to push security standards out

1379
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,860
um as part of their quality stuff you

1380
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,060
know like the like light there's like

1381
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,219
lighting groups like you know for like

1382
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:28,140
lighting manufacturers that are starting

1383
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,580
to push out you know certain security

1384
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,620
requirements as part of their quality

1385
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:32,820
standards Etc so it's showing up

1386
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,739
everywhere so that's one way it's moving

1387
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:35,699
into

1388
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:37,020
um the manufacturer but usually is the

1389
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,520
availability

1390
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,780
um the other thing is do they have

1391
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:41,580
contract data you know you know what

1392
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,500
data do they have the other thing is

1393
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,060
it's really shocking

1394
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:46,739
um I think in manufacturing environments

1395
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:48,659
people don't realize what's connected so

1396
01:10:48,659 --> 01:10:50,219
they think something is you know not

1397
01:10:50,219 --> 01:10:51,659
connected or vulnerable but then it's

1398
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:55,140
like well actually that system that's 75

1399
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,820
years old has something hooked up to it

1400
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,159
that you know tells you what level the

1401
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:01,739
materials are at and that talks back to

1402
01:11:01,739 --> 01:11:04,679
our you know sap and all of a sudden

1403
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:06,179
that becomes and then that pulls that

1404
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,980
whole thing into scope for whatever

1405
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,260
so to answer your question

1406
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,659
in a really roundabout way

1407
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:14,580
so it depends if you give me like a more

1408
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,500
specific situation I can answer it for

1409
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,620
sure

1410
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,940
that's that that's the thing is is as

1411
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,380
you bring things online and it's just

1412
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,179
having it is having a strategy for it

1413
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:41,940
and I hate to say this because you know

1414
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,739
as a third party absolutely you never

1415
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:45,179
want to sell like fear uncertainty and

1416
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:47,820
doubt but internally right if I'm if I'm

1417
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:50,219
an employee manufacturer then I'm happy

1418
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:52,260
to be like well look at here's 10 news

1419
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,179
articles in the past two months that

1420
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:55,920
show manufacturers that went out of

1421
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,840
business because they can't make stuff

1422
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,880
because they were compromised

1423
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,560
I hate to give that recommendation but

1424
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,540
internally like that's I hate when sales

1425
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:05,880
people do it but internally but I think

1426
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,800
that's one um and the other thing is I

1427
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,659
think look for you know whatever the

1428
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,219
manufacturer is

1429
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:12,480
um specifically I mean if they make

1430
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,040
steel then fine examples of Steel

1431
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,480
manufacturers if they you know and

1432
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,100
because I said manufacturers such a

1433
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,120
broad thing I mean they could make

1434
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,040
Pharmaceuticals or they could make you

1435
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,020
know parts for fighter jets or they

1436
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,699
could make I don't know like

1437
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:27,259
those troll to holes I don't know

1438
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:30,060
any other questions

1439
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:32,659
yes

1440
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,040
it's super well it can be super tough

1441
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,480
and it depends right I mean a lot of

1442
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,699
stuff is check the box

1443
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:45,420
um

1444
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:46,980
it really depends on the organization

1445
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:49,380
and kind of what their goals are the

1446
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,820
fact of the matter is

1447
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:52,739
um you know if you look at companies

1448
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:54,060
like

1449
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,380
think about all the companies that have

1450
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,520
gone out of business in the past like

1451
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,920
five or ten years right did they go to

1452
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,120
business because their security was bad

1453
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,159
no like companies do stupid things right

1454
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,540
I mean they make bad marketing decisions

1455
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:06,300
they make bad HR decisions uh make bad

1456
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,980
financial decisions

1457
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,300
um you know I mean you can't you can't

1458
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,460
go shop at Kmart right now and it's not

1459
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,960
because they have bad security right I

1460
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,460
mean it's so so all I'm saying is you

1461
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,380
know the expectation that companies are

1462
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,540
going to do everything make lots of bad

1463
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:19,980
decisions but do security really well

1464
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,739
right it's probably fantasy so it really

1465
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:23,940
depends

1466
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:28,020
um and again I do think that

1467
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,820
I promise you we're not going to get

1468
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,320
into like specific compliance talk

1469
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,300
because everybody's gonna hate me but if

1470
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,800
you look at things like you know like

1471
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,320
like PCI 4.0

1472
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,179
um you know PCI has like really evolved

1473
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:42,239
over the years back in the early days it

1474
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:43,560
said like you had to have a web

1475
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,120
application firewall that's what it said

1476
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,880
you could literally it could be set with

1477
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,640
any Yeti and as long as you had it

1478
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,520
he was a check mark right but over the

1479
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,320
years it morphed right to become more

1480
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,880
prescriptive and people like as much as

1481
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,400
people like beat up on PCI at least it

1482
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,320
tells you exactly what to do right not

1483
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,760
like hippo like HIPAA feels like it was

1484
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:03,900
written by Consultants to get more

1485
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,520
billable hours right it's like you can

1486
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,040
interpret however you want but like PCI

1487
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,320
is very specific and even that you know

1488
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,239
now it's moving a lot more towards

1489
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,480
judging the effectiveness of controls so

1490
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,000
and again nobody wants to talk about PCI

1491
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,500
but

1492
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,000
now at least if you're checking the

1493
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,100
boxes and those boxes are being checked

1494
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,840
thoroughly then you're going to be in a

1495
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,860
better position so I think it's it's

1496
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,360
probably a multitude of things that are

1497
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,159
going to move us towards that

1498
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:30,420
um but it's a tough situation plus

1499
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:31,380
nobody wants to spend money they don't

1500
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,820
have to it's like it's like insurance

1501
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,020
right

1502
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:35,880
I'll tell you I'd say I'm 44. I've been

1503
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,159
driving so now 16. I've had zero claims

1504
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,600
on my insurance ever

1505
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,100
right so you have all that money I've

1506
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:43,080
spent and if I had invested that

1507
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,360
conservatively right I should have just

1508
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,640
not had Insurance Taking My Chances

1509
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,140
right but again people just don't want

1510
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:49,920
to spend money on something they don't

1511
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,199
have to do

1512
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:56,100
can I answer your question sort of okay

1513
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,940
any other questions

1514
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,860
let's do it I love fun questions

1515
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:06,300
what

1516
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,900
what do you

1517
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,300
so here's the thing so I got my start

1518
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,400
running documentation many years ago

1519
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,980
um and before I go into security

1520
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,080
um so I worked in I worked at a website

1521
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,640
um like a media website doing coding and

1522
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,780
that kind of stuff and then I got into

1523
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,699
like process documentation

1524
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:25,500
and one thing that's kind of funny is if

1525
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,840
you ever are like sitting in a Ferrari

1526
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,100
512

1527
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:31,980
and you look at the owner's manual and

1528
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,380
you look at the media supplement and you

1529
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,600
look at the screenshots on there you

1530
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,760
will see that the radio station in the

1531
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,460
screenshot is a Cleveland radio station

1532
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,440
because I wrote a lot of the owner's

1533
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:44,760
manual for it

1534
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,860
nobody cares but it's fun here that's a

1535
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,179
funny fact

1536
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:50,400
um and so I've done I've done

1537
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,580
documentation forever and you know the

1538
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,260
the answer is the policy that I love

1539
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:57,000
best is the one that somebody had the

1540
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,620
most trouble with

1541
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,880
consultant like you can't be in

1542
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,199
Consulting for as long as I if you don't

1543
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,880
like what you do because it just burns

1544
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,500
you out right

1545
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,120
um and so policies are one of those

1546
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,980
things again it's like I mean are we

1547
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,020
saving lives no but is it pretty awesome

1548
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:11,520
to like walk into an environment where

1549
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,659
someone's like oh we've been having so

1550
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:13,800
much trouble getting this done and I

1551
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,880
don't know how to write this policy and

1552
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,320
you can help them out so that's my

1553
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,159
favorite policy to write

1554
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,540
I can answer your question without

1555
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,400
really answering it because I I mean

1556
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,140
there's like there's not I don't have a

1557
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,760
favorite policy

1558
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,040
all right

1559
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,420
any other questions

1560
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,960
yes

1561
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,020
I have not I played the old one which is

1562
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,699
not there anymore

1563
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:40,800
um but no I I need to go to the office

1564
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,560
because actually so I was I gave a

1565
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,060
presentation I actually I gave a six

1566
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,219
hour training

1567
01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:50,280
um a few weeks ago and right before the

1568
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,239
training

1569
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,380
um they tell us they don't have a

1570
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,340
projector

1571
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,380
so I'm like hey Dave I need a projector

1572
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,760
so of course he ships one to my house

1573
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,980
and so I use that and this is a long way

1574
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,060
of saying that I have the projector

1575
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,679
sitting on my desk at home and I have to

1576
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,480
take it into the office so I have to go

1577
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,699
in there anyway so

1578
01:17:05,699 --> 01:17:06,900
but yeah I'll go in there and play some

1579
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,640
video games I um

1580
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,219
so I'll tell one quick story all right

1581
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:14,580
so back in the old days we so we have a

1582
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,540
um

1583
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,940
we have a super Super Nintendo

1584
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,260
um in the old office

1585
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,600
and we played Mario Kart a lot

1586
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,800
um we're super busy now if it doesn't

1587
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,719
happen as much but I was always

1588
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,300
traveling as I was out working so I just

1589
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,340
never played and so I would get beat

1590
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,199
every time I played like every single

1591
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,580
time everybody made fun of me like it

1592
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:33,480
was awful

1593
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,520
and so

1594
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,320
um my wife now but we're just dating the

1595
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,060
time I went home and I told her so we go

1596
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:41,100
and we buy a Super Nintendo we buy Mario

1597
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,340
Kart and we played every night for like

1598
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,800
three hours we play Mario Kart

1599
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,320
and then so I go into the office and um

1600
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,760
this guy named Dave Thompson who was

1601
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,840
always just the greatest video game

1602
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,219
player ever he has the high score on our

1603
01:17:53,219 --> 01:17:55,020
pinball but I go and they're like oh

1604
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:56,219
let's play Mario Kart and they're like

1605
01:17:56,219 --> 01:17:57,239
all groanings they don't want to play

1606
01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:00,000
with me so we start playing I just nail

1607
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,940
them all right I win like by a lot

1608
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:04,260
um because I've been practicing for like

1609
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,600
four months and then I've never played

1610
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,659
again

1611
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,400
so yeah

1612
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,780
pardon

1613
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:15,179
it's yeah well I wasn't good as a kid

1614
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:16,320
either

1615
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,719
so it was it was not like riding a bike

1616
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,600
because I was just terrible

1617
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,820
but yes so yeah I'll go and check that

1618
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,000
out

1619
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,540
any other questions and I always say so

1620
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,340
I've worked so I I worked as I've been

1621
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,860
to trust that 10 years but prior to that

1622
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:32,940
we worked in a different consulting

1623
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,140
company together

1624
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,520
um and then he kind of went off and I

1625
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,780
went off to a software company you got

1626
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,580
back together but everyone's always like

1627
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,199
like what's a Michael yeah working in

1628
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:41,820
Dave Shadow I'm like it's not a shadow

1629
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,260
it's a glow

1630
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,300
right like I love it like we've worked

1631
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,100
together forever but I I've never been

1632
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,060
anywhere where I didn't get a question

1633
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,480
about Dave

1634
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,400

all right well thank you everybody so

1636
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,340
much as I said it's always I wasn't sure

1637
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,600
how big of a crowd we get talking about

1638
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,820
GRC and advisory given the competing

1639
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,260
track but I appreciate everyone coming

going to go ahead and start the next

1644
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,080
talk at 11 o'clock that will start from

1645
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,880
both rooms so in this room we're going

1646
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,620
to hear from Carrie Randolph but other

1647
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,000
than that you'll have a 10 minute break

1648
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,199
and then we'll start right back up at

1649
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,919
11. thank you

1650
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:47,100
welcome back everyone to the 11 o'clock

1651
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,719
talk we're trying to stay on schedule

1652
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,280
here with both sessions going on at the

1653
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,199
same time but this today we're going to

1654
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:54,000
hear from Carrie Randolph she is the

1655
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,159
senior security consultant for ghosts 30

1656
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:58,440
Pro previously she was the CIO for

1657
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,840
Oklahoma's Department of Education and

1658
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,159
she was one of the co-founders of

1659
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:04,380
besides Oklahoma so without further Ado

1660
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:05,699
we'll go ahead and introduce Kerry

1661
01:39:05,699 --> 01:39:07,199
Randolph on her presentation of working

1662
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,239
smarter not harder to thwart modern

1663
01:39:09,239 --> 01:39:10,890
hackers take it away

1664
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:14,880
[Applause]

1665
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,040
hey good morning everybody it's my first

1666
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:19,139
time in South Dakota coming from

1667
01:39:19,139 --> 01:39:21,239
Oklahoma so I'm really stoked to be here

1668
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:22,980
and share some information with you guys

1669
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:24,960
I hope you find it valuable

1670
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,480
today we're going to learn a couple

1671
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,500
different things we're going to learn

1672
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,179
how some Russian State actors are

1673
01:39:30,179 --> 01:39:33,000
bypassing Duo MFA I'm going to walk you

1674
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,060
through how we've exploited IPv6 we're

1675
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:37,560
going to talk about how we've extracted

1676
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,420
ldap service accounts from fax servers

1677
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:42,840
to eventually gain domain admin

1678
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,400
how to find systems with default

1679
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,020
credentials how to review and Harden

1680
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:49,380
your system configurations also why many

1681
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:52,139
vulnerabilities with the CVSs of 10.0

1682
01:39:52,139 --> 01:39:54,120
should not be on the top of your

1683
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,340
remediation priority and we're going to

1684
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:57,719
end with a step-by-step repeatable

1685
01:39:57,719 --> 01:39:59,639
process to identify vulnerabilities that

1686
01:39:59,639 --> 01:40:03,179
your vulnerability scanners cannot find

1687
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:05,460
a little bit about me and my company uh

1688
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:07,620
we're a small firm about four years old

1689
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:10,320
out of Tulsa Oklahoma I was co-founded

1690
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,179
by Jeff and Susan Wilson Jeff has

1691
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,159
extensive amazing background working for

1692
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:17,280
the NSA Federal auditor Susan leads up

1693
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,719
the legal side of our house is our

1694
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:20,340
company's president

1695
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:23,040
um I'm lead to the GRC side of the house

1696
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,600
and Ed Crandall does Business

1697
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:26,219
Development we've recently added a new

1698
01:40:26,219 --> 01:40:28,679
team member for client engagement but we

1699
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:30,000
specialize in bone management pin

1700
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,040
testing risk assessments were very

1701
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,500
strong in the HIPAA space we're seeing a

1702
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:37,260
lot more come through with glba and FTC

1703
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:40,020
safeguards and general virtual CSO

1704
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:41,159
Consulting

1705
01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:43,800
a little bit about me Annabelle gave a

1706
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,900
great introduction I went to local

1707
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:47,880
colleges in Oklahoma also local tech

1708
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,500
centers I placed a strong value in

1709
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,120
getting hands-on experience not just

1710
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,340
theoretical I have a strong background

1711
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,080
in public sector about 10 years of

1712
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:56,659
experience working with state government

1713
01:40:56,659 --> 01:40:59,159
I'm proud very proud to be a co-founder

1714
01:40:59,159 --> 01:41:01,320
of besides Oklahoma which is a security

1715
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,480
conference happening next month it'll be

1716
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:06,179
our ninth year I'm also a founding

1717
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:07,560
member of technohoma which is a

1718
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,840
non-profit in Oklahoma that works to

1719
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,940
facilitate different user groups across

1720
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,860
the state hack nights coding groups

1721
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:16,260
we've got crazy amounts of channels for

1722
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:17,760
every topic and programming language you

1723
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,280
can think of in Tech

1724
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,560
so today what we want to start with

1725
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,500
thinking is how do hackers think you

1726
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,420
know it's not all necessarily devious

1727
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,460
whether you know it or not every person

1728
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:32,159
in this room is a hacker starting with

1729
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,500
kids have you ever watched a kid trying

1730
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,300
to open up a cabinet door where they

1731
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,040
know that the snacks are or how to

1732
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,440
figure out a toy or how to work a

1733
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:43,500
smartphone those kids are hackers they

1734
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,300
have no fear that they're going to break

1735
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:47,000
something they're constantly

1736
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,920
manipulating things one tactic doesn't

1737
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,960
work I'm going to shift and pivot and

1738
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,699
try something else that is what they're

1739
01:41:53,699 --> 01:41:54,840
doing

1740
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,480
um my toddler has actually locked my

1741
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,639
phone up for 15 minutes she's enabled

1742
01:41:59,639 --> 01:42:03,179
accessibility features uh to for a

1743
01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:04,860
for the blind where you have these crazy

1744
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:07,260
touch controls it's crazy what all kids

1745
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,179
can do and you have no fear of breaking

1746
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:10,739
technology

1747
01:42:10,739 --> 01:42:11,940
so

1748
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:14,040
from our company this is a little bit of

1749
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,980
our methodology for pen testing and we

1750
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:18,179
want to start with thinking about

1751
01:42:18,179 --> 01:42:21,000
external Networks

1752
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,119
and how do you identify your exploitable

1753
01:42:24,119 --> 01:42:26,699
weaknesses to an internet-based attacker

1754
01:42:26,699 --> 01:42:28,380
your traditional traditional malicious

1755
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:31,380
attacker who has that true outsider's

1756
01:42:31,380 --> 01:42:33,540
perspective to your network

1757
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:34,440
um and you want to start with the

1758
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,480
vulnerability Management program and why

1759
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,060
that's so important uh regular ongoing

1760
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:40,860
process of identifying assessing and

1761
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:43,020
Reporting and managing weaknesses and

1762
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:45,540
vulnerabilities with new clients we see

1763
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:48,179
known vulnerabilities affecting 75

1764
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:50,580
percent of their systems and that's on

1765
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:51,900
average and this leaves a massive

1766
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:55,099
opportunity for hackers

1767
01:42:55,139 --> 01:42:56,520
um vulnerability Management's important

1768
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:59,159
it's required requirement for many audit

1769
01:42:59,159 --> 01:43:00,900
compliance risk management Frameworks

1770
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:03,840
nist nist 853 specifically calls it out

1771
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,619
IRS SSA sieges PCI there's lots of new

1772
01:43:07,619 --> 01:43:09,480
things going on with FTC safeguards

1773
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,100
those deadlines have been expanded from

1774
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,860
December to June cmmc if you're in

1775
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:17,520
manufacturing and DOD contracts Center

1776
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,320
for Internet Security also calls out

1777
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,360
continuous phone management as a

1778
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,320
critical security control

1779
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,420
so what we're seeing here this is a

1780
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,760
chart that's breaking down new

1781
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,780
vulnerabilities identified year to year

1782
01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:37,219
25 times increase in new vulnerabilities

1783
01:43:37,219 --> 01:43:41,760
discovered in 2022 from 20 000. and you

1784
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,460
might think why are there so many new

1785
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:47,219
vulnerabilities being discovered for

1786
01:43:47,219 --> 01:43:50,100
2023 we're on track to hit 24

1787
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,139
000 new vulnerabilities discovered in

1788
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:54,480
that year alone and the answer is

1789
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:57,600
hackers and research groups are becoming

1790
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,940
more prevalent hackers are no longer

1791
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:01,920
operating as individual groups their

1792
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,280
Fortune 500 companies it increases their

1793
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,960
bottom line to find new vulnerabilities

1794
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,900
that you have to

1795
01:44:08,900 --> 01:44:12,480
protect against and try to remediate

1796
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,360
recent studies are showing that most

1797
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,860
Security leaders have a vulnerability

1798
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:18,300
backlog of over a hundred thousand

1799
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:19,500
vulnerabilities

1800
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,540
the average time to fix a single

1801
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:25,080
vulnerability in 2021 was 202 days or

1802
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:26,699
seven months

1803
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:28,380
you have a backlog of 100 000

1804
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:29,820
vulnerabilities and it takes you seven

1805
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:32,159
months to fully remediate one how are we

1806
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:34,440
going to do this most orgs are still

1807
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,840
struggling to patch log 4J new stuff is

1808
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,060
coming out about log 4J and that came

1809
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,699
out in December of 2021

1810
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:43,679
um and they've got references here for

1811
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:45,000
where you can go and you can look at

1812
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,800
this data for yourself if you'd like but

1813
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,880
you know there's obvious technical

1814
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:49,619
challenge but I think a lot of the times

1815
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:51,780
we forget about people what are our

1816
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:53,760
processes and procedures

1817
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,139
um you know how can you ever work

1818
01:44:55,139 --> 01:44:56,400
through the sheer volume of

1819
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,139
vulnerabilities if you're not using

1820
01:44:58,139 --> 01:45:00,420
consistent methods of prioritizing

1821
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:03,239
remediation I've talked to organizations

1822
01:45:03,239 --> 01:45:07,380
that have zero scheduled maintenance

1823
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:09,840
how are admins ever going to be able to

1824
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,179
remediate vulnerabilities a bulk of them

1825
01:45:12,179 --> 01:45:14,699
there is some type of patching and you

1826
01:45:14,699 --> 01:45:16,860
have to reboot to apply patches if your

1827
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:18,840
business doesn't support maintenance and

1828
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,760
say no our systems have to be online 24

1829
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:22,739
7. you can't have regularly scheduled

1830
01:45:22,739 --> 01:45:24,360
maintenance what are Security

1831
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,400
Professionals or your assist admins

1832
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,260
supposed to do it becomes very very

1833
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,300
difficult to do just basic maintenance

1834
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:33,000
and again attackers are more well-funded

1835
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,760
than ever before and they have more

1836
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,619
resources and more incentive to discover

1837
01:45:37,619 --> 01:45:40,080
these new weaknesses

1838
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:42,480
uh so at go security pro we've

1839
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:45,600
identified what we have we coined as our

1840
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:46,980
three pillars of an effective

1841
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,440
vulnerability Management program and the

1842
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:51,679
first step is identification

1843
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,820
do you

1844
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:56,699
conduct automated external vulnerability

1845
01:45:56,699 --> 01:45:58,199
scanning where you're getting that

1846
01:45:58,199 --> 01:46:00,239
perspective of that true malicious

1847
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,020
attacker do you also do automated

1848
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:05,699
credentialed internal agent-based

1849
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:08,580
scanning the value with that is if a

1850
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:10,560
malicious attacker does get a foothold

1851
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,980
in your network where all can they go

1852
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,719
maybe you've got a really hardened

1853
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:17,699
exterior perimeter but what if a

1854
01:46:17,699 --> 01:46:19,260
credential becomes compromised they get

1855
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:20,940
the foot in the door where can they move

1856
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:23,280
what can they do manual testing is

1857
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,659
important and all three of these have to

1858
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:27,360
go on on a regular basis we've seen orgs

1859
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,820
hit with uh you know exploitable RDP

1860
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:32,460
exchange servers network devices you can

1861
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:35,880
also see exposed non-vulnerable services

1862
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,000
like database ports SMB signing web

1863
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,679
server content that maybe shouldn't be

1864
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:43,100
accessible

1865
01:46:44,219 --> 01:46:46,199
so the reason why you need both

1866
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:50,040
automated and manual testing is this

1867
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,679
automated testing is going to give you

1868
01:46:52,679 --> 01:46:54,600
that

1869
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,880
Auditor's perspective are you just

1870
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,980
trying to check a compliance box and say

1871
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,500
yes we do this you will see you know

1872
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:02,520
you'll have full access to all

1873
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:03,900
vulnerable applications like Adobe

1874
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:06,239
Reader Java all of those from the

1875
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:08,100
attacker's perspective you're actually

1876
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,600
testing for vulnerabilities so the

1877
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,060
auditor's toolkit doesn't identify

1878
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,320
um

1879
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,780
and that's really important to do both

1880
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,460
when you're testing for exploitable

1881
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:18,960
Ability it helps you find those things

1882
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,280
that the scanners aren't going to find

1883
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,139
you know maybe you couldn't fully

1884
01:47:22,139 --> 01:47:23,639
remediate a vulnerability but you were

1885
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:24,900
able to introduce some compensating

1886
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,060
controls maybe you can put it behind a

1887
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:28,800
DMZ maybe you can change some firewall

1888
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,100
rules how do you actually go through and

1889
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:34,500
verify did the changes I made fix this

1890
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:36,840
did it reduce the take it all back to a

1891
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,639
risk management framework did my

1892
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,679
compensating controls actually reduce

1893
01:47:40,679 --> 01:47:43,440
the likelihood of this event occurring

1894
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,139
or this vulnerability being exploited

1895
01:47:45,139 --> 01:47:48,780
you also have to have manual inspection

1896
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:50,699
to look for false positives

1897
01:47:50,699 --> 01:47:52,260
vulnerability scanning on web

1898
01:47:52,260 --> 01:47:54,900
applications is notorious for throwing

1899
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:57,060
false positives those web apps are

1900
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,800
working exactly the way that they're

1901
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,280
supposed to but it can trigger finding

1902
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,480
you need manual inspection to make sure

1903
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,460
you're getting all assets

1904
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:09,060
I mean if you are only scanning a

1905
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:10,679
section of your network and maybe you

1906
01:48:10,679 --> 01:48:12,659
don't even know I mean it professionals

1907
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:14,940
will go into places all the time and

1908
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:16,619
their inheriting systems they're

1909
01:48:16,619 --> 01:48:18,659
inheriting networks how do you do that

1910
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:19,800
Discovery and make sure you're

1911
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,080
protecting all of your network maybe

1912
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,119
you're on a college campus and okay hey

1913
01:48:24,119 --> 01:48:26,100
I'm seeing all the faculty but then you

1914
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,480
forget about oh there's this little

1915
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:30,060
group of computers in the library lab

1916
01:48:30,060 --> 01:48:32,100
those aren't being managed what's going

1917
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,260
on here so there's tons of

1918
01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:36,060
vulnerabilities that you can find that

1919
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:38,280
are not going to be being picked up on

1920
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:40,500
vulnerability scanners weak protocols

1921
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,440
default passwords week configuration so

1922
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,020
when we do manual testing we always find

1923
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:48,540
several default passwords that have huge

1924
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:51,119
impacts on the organization and I'll go

1925
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:52,260
into some of those in a little bit more

1926
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:55,340
detail as we go on

1927
01:48:55,739 --> 01:48:57,900
so digging into the external network

1928
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,580
when we do external network bone

1929
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:01,440
scanning what do we see

1930
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,580
Legacy TLS some of these will show TLS

1931
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:07,800
1.0 and 1.1 are vulnerable to man in the

1932
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:09,659
middle attacks which will risk Integrity

1933
01:49:09,659 --> 01:49:11,340
of authentication and the data sent

1934
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:13,320
between two points like a website and a

1935
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:16,080
browser they were deprecated by the

1936
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:19,020
internet engineering task force in 2020.

1937
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:21,719
there's also weak SSL TLS configurations

1938
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:24,300
remote desktop Services proxy logon

1939
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:27,060
default credentials you know the use of

1940
01:49:27,060 --> 01:49:29,219
weak encryption ciphers Des three days

1941
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:31,199
rc2 all of these are known to be

1942
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,600
affected by the birthday attack which is

1943
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,860
a essentially just a brute force method

1944
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:39,480
with some detailed math for short Cipher

1945
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:41,659
blocks

1946
01:49:41,659 --> 01:49:46,080
we once had an organization that they

1947
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,420
had extremely bad luck they were

1948
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:50,520
switching out a firewall and while they

1949
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,840
were switching out firewall they didn't

1950
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,840
realize that RDP was enabled on a server

1951
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,820
so in the short amount of time that they

1952
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:58,560
were switching out their firewall they

1953
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,199
had a breach because RDP was publicly

1954
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:04,159
exposed and facing

1955
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:06,420
so I want to walk you guys through

1956
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,679
something that we thought was pretty

1957
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:09,300
cool a relatively new hack that we

1958
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:10,619
started doing last year and this is

1959
01:50:10,619 --> 01:50:13,139
exploiting IPv6 I'm going to walk you

1960
01:50:13,139 --> 01:50:15,540
through the attack sequence steps one

1961
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,739
through three here is basically

1962
01:50:16,739 --> 01:50:19,080
intercepting DNS and we want to force

1963
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,780
victims to authenticate to our the

1964
01:50:21,780 --> 01:50:23,219
attacker system unless of course being

1965
01:50:23,219 --> 01:50:24,659
ethical hackers in this point people

1966
01:50:24,659 --> 01:50:26,040
were paying us to do this we weren't

1967
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,020
just doing it for fun

1968
01:50:28,020 --> 01:50:29,400
um so men in the middle six is the pen

1969
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,500
testing tool exploits default config of

1970
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:34,320
Windows to take over DNS default DNS by

1971
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,540
default Windows supports IPv6 and

1972
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:39,060
actually prefers it over version four uh

1973
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:40,920
Windows systems will request DHCP

1974
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:42,659
periodically so attack sequence uh

1975
01:50:42,659 --> 01:50:43,679
you're going to run men in the middle

1976
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:47,100
six uh I've got the script up there if

1977
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:48,540
you want to take screenshots of this

1978
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:51,179
feel free to go ahead the D just Limits

1979
01:50:51,179 --> 01:50:52,739
The Man in the middle activity to just

1980
01:50:52,739 --> 01:50:54,239
the target domain

1981
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:56,159
Windows is periodically going to lose

1982
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:59,280
that DHCP version 6 Discovery man in the

1983
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:01,440
middle is going to pop in and respond

1984
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,080
with DHCP leases get some fake IP

1985
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:05,820
addresses and then link some local

1986
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:08,400
ranges into think DNS server

1987
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,139
then we're going to use a regulate tool

1988
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:11,400
we're going to relay intercept

1989
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,199
authentication to admin controllers

1990
01:51:13,199 --> 01:51:15,600
again not going to fully go through the

1991
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:16,739
script there but feel free to take

1992
01:51:16,739 --> 01:51:18,239
screenshots if you want to use it and we

1993
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:19,800
have all the different syntax there to

1994
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:22,139
find and this is going to do wpad

1995
01:51:22,139 --> 01:51:23,880
spoofing and credential relaying it's

1996
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:26,159
selectively reply to DNS queries to add

1997
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:28,440
redirect authentication to the domain

1998
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,919
controller

1999
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:32,760
um within minutes of this pin test we

2000
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:34,500
had an export of all user accounts and

2001
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,540
all Group Policy settings

2002
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:39,060
if I have your user accounts it's only a

2003
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:40,380
matter of time before I can crack a

2004
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:41,100
password

2005
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:43,199
uh alternatively we can also relay that

2006
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,540
authentication to specific Target hosts

2007
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,260
um

2008
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:48,060
I thought local user as an admin we can

2009
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:49,800
get the password hashes if I have your

2010
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:52,100
hashes only a matter of time till I'm in

2011
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:54,000
this is something that vulnerability

2012
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,580
scanners do not find this is identified

2013
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:58,860
through manual detection prevention

2014
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:00,659
methods listed here disable your

2015
01:52:00,659 --> 01:52:02,699
vulnerable pump your vulnerable

2016
01:52:02,699 --> 01:52:05,280
protocols get your firewall set to block

2017
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:08,040
IPv6 disable some of your other settings

2018
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,739
group policy and enable SMB signing

2019
01:52:10,739 --> 01:52:12,600
that's another thing flip of a switch

2020
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:16,380
change a group policy push it out

2021
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:19,560
so this is fun

2022
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:21,360
service accounts default credentials and

2023
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,940
fax servers uh pen testing world this is

2024
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,440
like a little plot of gold at the end of

2025
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,060
the rainbow

2026
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,280
so what we did we were pin testing and

2027
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:31,800
we found a fax server no big deal we got

2028
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,719
in you might see some faxes maybe a

2029
01:52:33,719 --> 01:52:36,360
little bit of Phi maybe a little bit of

2030
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:39,600
pii putting on the organization but what

2031
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:42,420
we found is from a basic user account we

2032
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:44,460
could see the configuration and we've

2033
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:45,719
masked this we want to protect our

2034
01:52:45,719 --> 01:52:48,840
clients obviously but we can see here is

2035
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,820
the fact server is authenticating with

2036
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:53,400
ldap they had a service account that was

2037
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,139
mapped to their login server which is

2038
01:52:55,139 --> 01:52:57,060
their domain controller and we could see

2039
01:52:57,060 --> 01:52:58,560
the user account now the login password

2040
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:00,659
is masked so we couldn't really see that

2041
01:53:00,659 --> 01:53:04,440
so what could you do here

2042
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:07,440
we can change the configuration so we

2043
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,360
decided to stand up our own ldap server

2044
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,820
and we redirected it and we reinforced

2045
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:13,679
plain text authentication then we had

2046
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:15,000
the password

2047
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,300
unfortunately for the client the service

2048
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,159
account for that effect server was set

2049
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:21,840
up as a domain admin they had not

2050
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:23,520
followed principles of lease privilege

2051
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,900
so we were game over one fun fact just a

2052
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:30,900
our firm when we do pen testing we set

2053
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:33,840
an engagement and once we obtained

2054
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,940
domain admin it's not fully game over

2055
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:38,639
for us we reset and we go back to the

2056
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,020
back of the beginning of the drawing

2057
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:42,540
board and we start testing again like we

2058
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:44,100
had not obtained domain admin to see

2059
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:47,540
what those other attack vectors might be

2060
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:49,560
so how can you identify these unknown

2061
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,659
bones what all is out there there's so

2062
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:53,040
many different systems there's so many

2063
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:55,020
different softwares what can you do so

2064
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:57,300
again these manual testing is needed

2065
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:58,860
whether you're using qualis tenable

2066
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:01,679
nessus rapid seven they're not going to

2067
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:03,659
detect default and weak passwords

2068
01:54:03,659 --> 01:54:06,420
vulnerable protocols like POP3 and IMAP

2069
01:54:06,420 --> 01:54:09,540
in your Office 365 environment they um

2070
01:54:09,540 --> 01:54:12,840
any support for legacy TLS thinking

2071
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:15,239
about third parties the speaker before

2072
01:54:15,239 --> 01:54:16,500
you know talked a lot about third party

2073
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,440
risk management do you require unique

2074
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,719
accounts for each individual at your

2075
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:24,480
third party support Personnel or is that

2076
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,360
admin credential for your MSP may be

2077
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:29,940
shared among five ten fifty different

2078
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:32,760
support staff at your MSP how are they

2079
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:35,460
securing that credential with privileged

2080
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:38,760
rights into your network these are all

2081
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:40,500
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by

2082
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,780
attackers so even when we have these

2083
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:44,400
volumes in our inventory of known

2084
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:45,860
vulnerabilities

2085
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:48,360
for whatever reason they're not getting

2086
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:51,360
prioritized

2087
01:54:52,199 --> 01:54:53,639
so we talked a little bit about default

2088
01:54:53,639 --> 01:54:55,800
credentials on average we find 18

2089
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:58,139
default credentials on internal networks

2090
01:54:58,139 --> 01:55:00,380
with new clients

2091
01:55:00,380 --> 01:55:04,500
laziness with setting up systems so I'm

2092
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:06,540
going to walk you through this is going

2093
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,880
to seem a little rudimentary but hey

2094
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,800
here's what works right so this is step

2095
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,080
by step what we do first we're going to

2096
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:15,239
run nmap we're going to see what all is

2097
01:55:15,239 --> 01:55:16,800
out there again feel free to take images

2098
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:19,260
or you know take a shot of this script

2099
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:21,719
it's going to work over everything

2100
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:22,440
um

2101
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:26,699
so once we have those URLs and IPS for

2102
01:55:26,699 --> 01:55:28,380
their systems we're going to extract

2103
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:30,840
those URLs and then we're going to just

2104
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:33,600
open them up in the multiple URLs

2105
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,340
Firefox plugin and we're going to start

2106
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:37,080
working through tabs

2107
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:38,639
we're going to manually start googling

2108
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,320
each of the products they have and what

2109
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,760
are the default passwords for that

2110
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,619
system common default credentials are

2111
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:45,300
going to include admin admin admin

2112
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,119
password or admin and a blank password

2113
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:49,380
some less common ones we've seen for

2114
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:51,780
like Dell remote access controls is root

2115
01:55:51,780 --> 01:55:53,280
Calvin

2116
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,960
um I've got some other printers out

2117
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:57,119
there some ABCs some badge access

2118
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:58,440
systems

2119
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:01,139
so many of these are kept with default

2120
01:56:01,139 --> 01:56:03,119
credentials and again if I can log into

2121
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,280
those systems and I'm there where else

2122
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,320
can I pivot or move laterally or other

2123
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:10,080
things that I can find or are those

2124
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,119
Associated service accounts potentially

2125
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:13,739
domain admin or have higher levels of

2126
01:56:13,739 --> 01:56:15,480
Rights

2127
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:17,159
so that's covering a vulnerability

2128
01:56:17,159 --> 01:56:19,260
identification next up we're going to

2129
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:20,940
look at prioritization and communication

2130
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,800
you know are you prioritizing based on

2131
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,440
risk and exploitability not just a CVS

2132
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,420
score are you accounting for changing

2133
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:29,580
threat landscape what is actually being

2134
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:31,199
exploited

2135
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:34,080
in the wild in real time what exploits

2136
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,760
are people actually using and how are

2137
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,679
you regularly communicating those top

2138
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:40,500
priorities to it teams maybe in a bigger

2139
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:41,820
organization you have someone that's

2140
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:44,340
doing volume scanning and is it someone

2141
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:46,199
on the applications team to fix this or

2142
01:56:46,199 --> 01:56:48,360
is it someone on the servers team is it

2143
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,340
if it's IIs is it applications or is it

2144
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:53,400
server is it networking or is it server

2145
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,560
who is going to be responsible for this

2146
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:57,600
and how are you communicating once you

2147
01:56:57,600 --> 01:56:59,760
identify

2148
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,199
um so this is just a simple screenshot

2149
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:03,600
from uh from qualis it's a normal

2150
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,219
vulnerability dashboard that you might

2151
01:57:05,219 --> 01:57:06,600
be used to singing if you've used one

2152
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:11,400
before and you log in and you see 187

2153
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,340
000 unique vulnerabilities

2154
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:16,500
it's overwhelming it's incredibly

2155
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,560
overwhelming and where do you start

2156
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:24,420
um how do you pick which one to do first

2157
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:28,380
um how can you take this technology and

2158
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:29,580
then also from an administrative

2159
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:31,380
approach you think oh hey I've got this

2160
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:33,540
tool that's identifying my

2161
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:34,800
vulnerabilities but are your staff

2162
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:37,679
trained to use it properly how are you

2163
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:39,659
integrating the people elements and the

2164
01:57:39,659 --> 01:57:41,699
processes to actually be effective with

2165
01:57:41,699 --> 01:57:43,260
your program

2166
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:45,900
so what we do is we incorporate csis

2167
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:47,520
known exploited vulnerabilities catalog

2168
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,219
I think it's up to as of last night it

2169
01:57:50,219 --> 01:57:52,619
was 896 items and these are

2170
01:57:52,619 --> 01:57:55,739
vulnerabilities that sisa has known that

2171
01:57:55,739 --> 01:57:58,080
a malicious attacker has actually taken

2172
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,260
action on and had a successful result

2173
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:02,639
another thing that we do is we bring in

2174
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:04,739
red team analysis we're not just looking

2175
01:58:04,739 --> 01:58:07,139
at those scores of top tens we are

2176
01:58:07,139 --> 01:58:09,599
looking for the things of what make our

2177
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,360
hackers happy if they go into this

2178
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:14,699
system and they see this

2179
01:58:14,699 --> 01:58:16,560
what is going to get them in what is

2180
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:17,820
something that's very easy to exploit

2181
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:20,280
SMB signing is huge if our hackers see

2182
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:21,780
that they're going to get so happy

2183
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:23,040
especially if it's on a domain

2184
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,179
controller

2185
01:58:24,179 --> 01:58:26,699
um you can export full lists of users

2186
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:28,800
and makes it really easy to then start

2187
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,139
doing credential hashing

2188
01:58:31,139 --> 01:58:32,820
and sometimes even things is like auto

2189
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:34,980
run and auto play

2190
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:36,659
if we can exploit that and if we're

2191
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:38,400
actually physically on site what type of

2192
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,900
USB drive can I plug in and it's

2193
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:42,420
automatically going to execute

2194
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:45,420
so doing a little bit of a dive into CSA

2195
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:47,699
known exploited balms these are the

2196
01:58:47,699 --> 01:58:48,840
volumes that have been exported and

2197
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:50,159
here's a breakdown of their different

2198
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:52,519
scores

2199
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:56,639
the 10 out of 10 this represents 1.4 of

2200
01:58:56,639 --> 01:58:59,340
all known cves not just the sisa

2201
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:00,960
vulnerabilities but all known

2202
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:04,080
vulnerabilities with a 10 out of 10 CVSs

2203
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:04,880
score

2204
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,460
if you start trying to work through your

2205
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:10,800
10 out of 10 and there's let's just say

2206
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,300
we're just looking at the Cecil ones and

2207
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:14,460
there's 124 of them it's going to take

2208
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:17,159
you seven months to remediate one on

2209
01:59:17,159 --> 01:59:20,580
average you're never going to get out of

2210
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:22,320
working that 10 range because new

2211
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,599
vulnerabilities are being discovered 25

2212
01:59:24,599 --> 01:59:26,880
000 bones discovered last year we're on

2213
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,440
track to have around the same amount

2214
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:31,139
discovered this year so while the sisa

2215
01:59:31,139 --> 01:59:33,239
catalog gives us insight to those

2216
01:59:33,239 --> 01:59:34,679
volumes that are known to be exploited

2217
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:36,599
you know what else can we learn

2218
01:59:36,599 --> 01:59:40,679
what we're seeing is attackers know that

2219
01:59:40,679 --> 01:59:42,540
it's very common hey this has the

2220
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:44,400
highest score I should start working on

2221
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:45,719
that first that's the most critical

2222
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:47,520
right so what they're doing instead of

2223
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,239
exploiting those high risk very critical

2224
01:59:51,239 --> 01:59:53,099
vulnerabilities they're stringing

2225
01:59:53,099 --> 01:59:55,560
together attacks using multiple exploits

2226
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:58,860
from that five to eight range

2227
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:01,380
so like SMB signing I think that's like

2228
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:04,800
a 7.5 maybe somewhere ish in there on a

2229
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:08,460
CVS score so they are being smart it's

2230
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:10,380
the same intelligence that we have as

2231
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:11,760
Defenders

2232
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,440
um or if you're a pen tester too you're

2233
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:14,639
looking through these things if you can

2234
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:16,080
string multiple attacks together that

2235
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:18,179
are less likely to go under the radar uh

2236
02:00:18,179 --> 02:00:19,679
it's you're going to be in and it's

2237
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,179
going to be easier for you to perform

2238
02:00:21,179 --> 02:00:22,800
your attack

2239
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,199
um

2240
02:00:24,199 --> 02:00:26,820
list only presents about half a percent

2241
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:29,460
of all known vulnerabilities and it's

2242
02:00:29,460 --> 02:00:31,139
really an amazing reference and but it

2243
02:00:31,139 --> 02:00:33,540
can't be your only influence on what

2244
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:36,560
you're prioritizing

2245
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:41,159
um so what is not in the CSA catalog uh

2246
02:00:41,159 --> 02:00:43,679
here's a handful of things that are on

2247
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:45,780
there these are things that red teams

2248
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:49,080
find but automated scanning does not and

2249
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:50,340
a lot of these things come down to

2250
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:52,020
configuration how are you enforcing your

2251
02:00:52,020 --> 02:00:54,480
group policy

2252
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:55,739
um so we're going to switch we're gonna

2253
02:00:55,739 --> 02:00:57,000
that's external network we're going to

2254
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,619
look at internal Network and what do we

2255
02:00:58,619 --> 02:01:00,799
see

2256
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:04,679
uh we see patching Legacy stuff and

2257
02:01:04,679 --> 02:01:06,840
configurations so with patching are you

2258
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,400
doing operating system patches what

2259
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:09,840
about your firmware what about your

2260
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,760
third-party software

2261
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,020
um we see Legacy systems and

2262
02:01:13,020 --> 02:01:14,040
applications

2263
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:15,480
um you know patching is really such a

2264
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:17,520
broad and simplistic term

2265
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:20,159
um in comparison to how good patching or

2266
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:23,159
bad practices will overall affect your

2267
02:01:23,159 --> 02:01:25,619
security posture most major volumes are

2268
02:01:25,619 --> 02:01:27,840
zero days that get a special name you

2269
02:01:27,840 --> 02:01:29,760
know like print nightmare or blue key

2270
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:33,540
paternal blue those things are so severe

2271
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,159
they're going to be remediated by

2272
02:01:35,159 --> 02:01:36,659
patching and it's going to be very high

2273
02:01:36,659 --> 02:01:39,119
priority and high visibility so you know

2274
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:40,860
maybe you have automated Tools in place

2275
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:43,139
to push OS patches but do you also have

2276
02:01:43,139 --> 02:01:44,340
the means of patching third-party

2277
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:45,719
software that can be difficult

2278
02:01:45,719 --> 02:01:47,280
especially for smaller shops that don't

2279
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,739
have an Enterprise level budget you know

2280
02:01:49,739 --> 02:01:51,300
outdated Adobe Reader and acrobat

2281
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:53,040
there's massive campaigns going on right

2282
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,380
now especially targeting HR with

2283
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:57,360
LinkedIn and indeed and they're sending

2284
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:59,280
malicious PDF files and if one of those

2285
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:02,159
recruiters open up a PDF that they think

2286
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:04,260
as a resume and they happen to have a

2287
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:06,659
legacy Adobe Reader Adobe DC on their

2288
02:02:06,659 --> 02:02:09,179
systems it's a high probability that

2289
02:02:09,179 --> 02:02:10,980
just by opening that PDF that they think

2290
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:12,659
is part of their daily job duty is going

2291
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:14,880
to infect their system

2292
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,560
um Legacy is just understanding the

2293
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,080
severity of no more patches how do you

2294
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:21,659
explain that to administrators and yeah

2295
02:02:21,659 --> 02:02:23,520
hey technically it's still running it's

2296
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,500
operational but what is the impact

2297
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:27,480
there's no more security patches there

2298
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:29,340
is no more support from the vendor from

2299
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:30,659
this

2300
02:02:30,659 --> 02:02:31,800
um you know we talked about default

2301
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,960
credentials earlier uh but what about

2302
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:35,719
shared credentials what about

2303
02:02:35,719 --> 02:02:39,000
non-expiring credentials I had a risk

2304
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,380
assessment binding

2305
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:44,099
for a shared credential for a client

2306
02:02:44,099 --> 02:02:47,340
that had an MSP they had 50 support

2307
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:50,460
staff with access to that credential and

2308
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:51,840
they had a breach

2309
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:54,239
forensics pointed back to the msps

2310
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,159
account you know did they go into the

2311
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:57,540
details of full forensics and

2312
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:59,400
accountability there

2313
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,440
um I'm not at Liberty to speak but the

2314
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,940
point is the more people that know a

2315
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:04,739
secret is means it's not a secret

2316
02:03:04,739 --> 02:03:07,020
anymore and then you have other

2317
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:08,520
regulation and other compliance

2318
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,260
requirements like HIPAA has a unique

2319
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,540
attribute access rule it is a HIPAA

2320
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:14,280
requirement that every single individual

2321
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:16,560
has to have a unique attribute so when

2322
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:17,880
you go back and look at your logs you

2323
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:19,080
have to be able to clearly and

2324
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:21,540
definitively say it was this person that

2325
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:23,099
took this action

2326
02:03:23,099 --> 02:03:25,380
uh Wii configurations

2327
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:27,480
um these are all things that a lot of it

2328
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:29,159
will tie back into policies and

2329
02:03:29,159 --> 02:03:31,619
procedures it's not the sexy cool

2330
02:03:31,619 --> 02:03:34,080
hacking Mr Robot stuff that you see on

2331
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:36,780
TV there's a lot of cyber security that

2332
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:39,679
is downright boring and a little mundane

2333
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:43,020
policy and procedures are are really a

2334
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:44,699
huge piece and serve as the foundations

2335
02:03:44,699 --> 02:03:48,259
of your internal security program

2336
02:03:51,239 --> 02:03:54,300
fishing bypassing Duo so there's a

2337
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:56,040
situation where Russian State actors

2338
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:57,900
gained a foothold at a non-government

2339
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,340
organization through a weak password

2340
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:01,139
whether that was a default credential

2341
02:04:01,139 --> 02:04:04,199
you know April 2022 exclamation point or

2342
02:04:04,199 --> 02:04:07,320
2023 but the account was active in A.D

2343
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:10,199
but it was unenrolled in Duo so they

2344
02:04:10,199 --> 02:04:12,500
were able to enroll that accountant Duo

2345
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:15,599
and it prompts for re-enrollment so the

2346
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,280
user was still active in ad so they were

2347
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:20,420
able to get enrolled

2348
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:24,119
and at the bottom we're just walking

2349
02:04:24,119 --> 02:04:26,940
through you know what that duo login

2350
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:30,360
looks like where they're hey verify the

2351
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:33,000
ownership and then they have the QR code

2352
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,920
that they need to sign and they are

2353
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:36,960
completely activated within Duo

2354
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,300
once they were in as a standard user

2355
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:41,639
they found print nightmare

2356
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:43,440
from there they were able to execute to

2357
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,900
privilege escalation to administrator

2358
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:49,080
and from there they could disable Duo on

2359
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:51,060
certain hosts and there's a script if

2360
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:53,040
you want to see what they used there's a

2361
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,179
little bit of that that was redacted

2362
02:04:54,179 --> 02:04:56,040
just to protect the client the the NGO

2363
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:59,639
that this happened to but you know Duo

2364
02:04:59,639 --> 02:05:02,760
configured to fail open so MFA is not

2365
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,560
required if the duo server cannot be

2366
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:05,520
reached

2367
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,560
then they were able to RDP into domain

2368
02:05:07,560 --> 02:05:09,239
controllers you might think you know

2369
02:05:09,239 --> 02:05:10,440
what could we do to prevent something

2370
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:13,320
like this and avoid re-enrollment

2371
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:16,080
scenarios avoid fail open configuration

2372
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:20,159
from a boring policy procedure you know

2373
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:22,320
think about reviewing your accounts your

2374
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,599
periodic access reviews what are your

2375
02:05:24,599 --> 02:05:26,580
termination procedures like does it

2376
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:28,500
actually get notified within a

2377
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,880
reasonable time frame that someone's

2378
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,560
been terminated or is no longer with the

2379
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:34,139
company you know ensuring those inactive

2380
02:05:34,139 --> 02:05:36,960
accounts are fully disabled and active

2381
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:39,659
directory and not just unenrolled and

2382
02:05:39,659 --> 02:05:40,800
then print nightmare you know that's

2383
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:41,880
huge that's something that you should

2384
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:43,980
have patched it's actually also in

2385
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:45,540
ceases known exploited vulnerabilities

2386
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:47,880
catalog and make sure that you don't

2387
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:50,880
have fail open set that is not unique to

2388
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,239
Duo

2389
02:05:53,639 --> 02:05:55,199
um another hack that I find really

2390
02:05:55,199 --> 02:05:57,659
interesting because it used multiple

2391
02:05:57,659 --> 02:06:00,179
attack vectors uh was the Uber hack in

2392
02:06:00,179 --> 02:06:02,820
September of 2022 it's now been

2393
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:05,219
attributed to lapses what happened was

2394
02:06:05,219 --> 02:06:06,900
they fished for credentials

2395
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:08,340
once they got credentials they were

2396
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:10,080
stopped by Duo

2397
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:12,719
so then they did an exhaustion attack on

2398
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:15,480
Duo and they had a per a certain identif

2399
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:17,360
person that they had already identified

2400
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:20,520
and they wished them they called them up

2401
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:22,679
on the phone and said hey I'm so-and-so

2402
02:06:22,679 --> 02:06:24,659
with it you've probably noticed that

2403
02:06:24,659 --> 02:06:26,580
your phone's been going nuts with Duo

2404
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:28,080
notifications we're having a little bit

2405
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:31,739
of issues MIT I need you to verify

2406
02:06:31,739 --> 02:06:34,080
what's your authentication code on Duo

2407
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:35,340
right now

2408
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,860
the person gave it to them

2409
02:06:37,860 --> 02:06:39,780
so they were in once they were in with

2410
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:41,580
that person's credentials they've

2411
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:43,679
located a Powershell script and inside

2412
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:45,420
of that script was hard-coded

2413
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:47,159
credentials and those credentials

2414
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:48,540
happened to be for their privileged

2415
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,520
access management system

2416
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:53,460
so from there they're in the Pam they

2417
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:56,219
could give themselves access to anything

2418
02:06:56,219 --> 02:06:59,219
that that Pam was managing so they give

2419
02:06:59,219 --> 02:07:00,960
themselves elevated privileges oh I want

2420
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:03,060
this this it was like a shopping spree

2421
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:04,980
with Daddy's credit card

2422
02:07:04,980 --> 02:07:09,480
um so we've now found that over 70 77

2423
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:11,099
000 employee records were found to have

2424
02:07:11,099 --> 02:07:13,380
been exfiltrated user data was not but

2425
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:14,280
they got

2426
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:17,699
a cash a big fat loot box of tons of

2427
02:07:17,699 --> 02:07:20,400
employee data

2428
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,679
uh we configurations uh remediated with

2429
02:07:22,679 --> 02:07:26,159
group policy SMB signing it should be

2430
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:28,199
enabled and required this is simple

2431
02:07:28,199 --> 02:07:31,500
through group policy if this is on a

2432
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:34,199
domain controller you're open to Mana

2433
02:07:34,199 --> 02:07:37,080
middle tax through SMB poisoning null

2434
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:39,020
sessions land man

2435
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:41,040
null sessions are going to allow

2436
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:42,900
unauthenticated attacker to get that

2437
02:07:42,900 --> 02:07:45,480
list of local users when it affects

2438
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:47,340
domain controllers you can get a full

2439
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:50,400
listing of domain users once again once

2440
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:51,960
you've got that list of users you can

2441
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:53,520
start doing credential sprays in Brute

2442
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:56,520
Force null sessions allows any

2443
02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:58,199
authenticated user to obtain sensitive

2444
02:07:58,199 --> 02:07:59,780
information about the system

2445
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:03,000
landman and tlm V1 it's just a weak

2446
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,280
method for encrypting passwords it's

2447
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:06,659
open to man in the middle attacks

2448
02:08:06,659 --> 02:08:09,179
default auditing isn't necessarily A

2449
02:08:09,179 --> 02:08:11,940
vulnerability but it is a risk if you

2450
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:13,560
don't have audit logs going back 90 days

2451
02:08:13,560 --> 02:08:16,679
to a year you're likely not going to

2452
02:08:16,679 --> 02:08:19,739
have enough evidence if you do have some

2453
02:08:19,739 --> 02:08:22,380
type of security event or intrusion and

2454
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:23,880
for bigger targets and bigger

2455
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:25,679
organizations we're seeing more and more

2456
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:27,960
that attackers will gain that initial

2457
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:29,099
foothold

2458
02:08:29,099 --> 02:08:30,900
and then they sit and wait

2459
02:08:30,900 --> 02:08:32,460
you know maybe you've seen in movies or

2460
02:08:32,460 --> 02:08:33,659
something and you see a sniper getting

2461
02:08:33,659 --> 02:08:34,800
into position and they're on the ground

2462
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:37,800
and they're there for days weeks slowly

2463
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:39,599
moving into the environment same thing

2464
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,219
as malicious attackers they're gonna get

2465
02:08:41,219 --> 02:08:42,540
into that environment and they want to

2466
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:44,940
try to stay undetected for as long as

2467
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:46,800
possible so they're going to take teeny

2468
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:48,900
tiny small movements in your system do

2469
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:50,580
some Recon figure out where they can go

2470
02:08:50,580 --> 02:08:52,139
and not be noticed and what all they can

2471
02:08:52,139 --> 02:08:53,699
find so sometimes they might be in your

2472
02:08:53,699 --> 02:08:56,280
system for more than three months if you

2473
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:58,199
don't have audit logs going back then

2474
02:08:58,199 --> 02:09:00,179
you're not going to be able to tell when

2475
02:09:00,179 --> 02:09:02,099
did this actually start

2476
02:09:02,099 --> 02:09:04,080
and then default ldap you know again

2477
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:07,679
with the back server examples if you if

2478
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:10,920
you have open DC's then with default

2479
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:13,020
ldap then it's going to be pretty easy

2480
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:15,900
to get that privilege privilege access

2481
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:18,259
right

2482
02:09:19,139 --> 02:09:21,420
and password controls are

2483
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:23,760
pretty standard I have a feeling that

2484
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:24,960
most people in this room have a pretty

2485
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,760
good idea about password controls but

2486
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:27,599
we're going to go into a little bit

2487
02:09:27,599 --> 02:09:30,000
anyways and organizations when I'm doing

2488
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,560
risk assessments I see a lot of things

2489
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:33,840
with how are you managing local admin

2490
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,119
accounts laps Microsoft's local

2491
02:09:36,119 --> 02:09:37,920
administrator password solution is a

2492
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,780
free built-in tool for active directory

2493
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:41,520
and you might think what's the big deal

2494
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,219
you got local admin we still have group

2495
02:09:44,219 --> 02:09:47,400
policy from 80 that's setting everything

2496
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,560
up and controlling everything if I have

2497
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:51,119
the local admin I can change local

2498
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:52,980
policy

2499
02:09:52,980 --> 02:09:55,739
I can stop a machine from checking for

2500
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:57,840
group policy and updating and enrolling

2501
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,060
in group policy if you get local admin

2502
02:10:00,060 --> 02:10:01,500
it's only a matter of time before you

2503
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:03,480
can Elevate from a local admin to a

2504
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:05,820
domain admin so this is a great free

2505
02:10:05,820 --> 02:10:08,159
tool whether you're setting the same

2506
02:10:08,159 --> 02:10:10,679
username and password across all ad

2507
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:12,540
accounts or local admins for each

2508
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:15,300
workstation in your system I'd very much

2509
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:17,460
encourage you to use this free tool get

2510
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:20,400
that unique credential for every single

2511
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:23,659
local admin on your network

2512
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:25,380
um so this is probably going to be

2513
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:27,060
really remedial but I left it in here

2514
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:28,440
because I thought you guys might find

2515
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:30,060
Value in taking it back to your clients

2516
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:32,460
your customers your constituents

2517
02:10:32,460 --> 02:10:34,199
um recent pin test that we did two

2518
02:10:34,199 --> 02:10:35,760
percent of employees had one of these

2519
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:38,639
passwords in a similar syntax where you

2520
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:41,820
have first letters capitalized month

2521
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:43,860
word whatever season

2522
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:45,540
did rotate your password every 90 days

2523
02:10:45,540 --> 02:10:46,920
what's the season we're in what's the

2524
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:48,719
month we're in followed by the year and

2525
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:51,560
an explanation exclamation point

2526
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:53,580
these passwords are very easy to

2527
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:55,699
remember but they're also very guessable

2528
02:10:55,699 --> 02:10:58,260
do you have tools you know what can you

2529
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:00,900
do in your systems to prevent stuff like

2530
02:11:00,900 --> 02:11:02,940
this there are certain tools that are

2531
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:04,080
out there that'll allow you to build

2532
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:06,060
like a loud list and block lists for

2533
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:08,219
certain passwords or certain syntax you

2534
02:11:08,219 --> 02:11:11,219
can prohibit consecutive letters and

2535
02:11:11,219 --> 02:11:15,179
numbers you know ascending or descending

2536
02:11:15,179 --> 02:11:17,940
um with Azure ad with at least a premium

2537
02:11:17,940 --> 02:11:21,300
P1 license you can enable custom band

2538
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:24,239
passwords and you can add entries into a

2539
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:26,580
banned password list so you know Dakota

2540
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:28,920
2023 exclamation point couldn't be a

2541
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,360
password potentially at Dakota State

2542
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:32,598
University

2543
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,199
also thinking about reusing power

2544
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:38,760
passwords across services

2545
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:40,980
and you know where's the value in a

2546
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:43,619
password manager I personally use a

2547
02:11:43,619 --> 02:11:45,900
password manager I understand the

2548
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,639
concept of putting all your eggs in one

2549
02:11:47,639 --> 02:11:51,000
basket but if I have a 20 plus character

2550
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,699
complex password and I back it up with

2551
02:11:53,699 --> 02:11:56,340
MFA remember we can't depend on just a

2552
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:58,199
single layer of Defense we have to

2553
02:11:58,199 --> 02:12:01,080
multi-layer things to have a true scope

2554
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:03,360
of security

2555
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:05,040
um but you know that benefit manage of a

2556
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:06,300
password manager is it's going to let

2557
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:08,040
you generate that random secure password

2558
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:10,020
a unique credential for every single

2559
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:11,880
service that you use

2560
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:13,080
um do you guys remember when Colonial

2561
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:15,719
pipeline was hacked in 2021

2562
02:12:15,719 --> 02:12:20,040
it was chaos on the East Coast from DC

2563
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:22,679
Baltimore Maryland area all the way down

2564
02:12:22,679 --> 02:12:25,020
to the Carolinas in Georgia uh was it

2565
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:27,420
gas stations in DC 80 some odd percent

2566
02:12:27,420 --> 02:12:29,460
of them were out of gas

2567
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:32,460
and 40 on down the coast there were

2568
02:12:32,460 --> 02:12:34,380
pictures in the media of people going up

2569
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:36,300
like plastic Walmart shopping bags and

2570
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:37,980
filling shopping bags full of gasoline

2571
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:39,360
because they were scared and they were

2572
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:40,860
hoarding it it was mass panic in the

2573
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:42,060
streets

2574
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:45,060
um the president had to issue executive

2575
02:12:45,060 --> 02:12:48,300
orders because aircraft could not refuel

2576
02:12:48,300 --> 02:12:50,040
they were out of fuel at airports so

2577
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:52,800
they had to have executive orders to

2578
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,300
change

2579
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:57,480
um the laws governing how fuel can be

2580
02:12:57,480 --> 02:13:00,000
transported across interstates

2581
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,980
Interstate boundaries they had to change

2582
02:13:01,980 --> 02:13:03,179
that

2583
02:13:03,179 --> 02:13:05,099
um so what happened with Colonial

2584
02:13:05,099 --> 02:13:08,760
pipeline is they compromised a

2585
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:10,920
credential for a legacy VPN

2586
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:13,380
mark one Legacy VPN

2587
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:15,599
compromise credential weak credential

2588
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:17,760
maybe how was that password configured

2589
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:20,040
did they have configurations in place at

2590
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:21,840
oh after so many failed attempts this

2591
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,699
account's gonna lock up

2592
02:13:23,699 --> 02:13:26,400
and it was single Factor Authentication

2593
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,619
remote access single Factor

2594
02:13:28,619 --> 02:13:30,540
authentication once you have username

2595
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:33,119
and password you're in and so yeah one

2596
02:13:33,119 --> 02:13:36,300
single password was cracked at Colonial

2597
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:38,280
pipeline stopped their production for

2598
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:40,560
three to four business days and it was

2599
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:44,179
mass panic on the Eastern seaboard

2600
02:13:44,699 --> 02:13:46,500
um so again I think you guys are all

2601
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:48,119
going to be this is very remedial for

2602
02:13:48,119 --> 02:13:49,079
you but I thought you might find it

2603
02:13:49,079 --> 02:13:51,840
valuable to share with your constituents

2604
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:55,260
um which password stronger

2605
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:57,780
you guys want to shout out one or two

2606
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,820
why

2607
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:02,639
exactly modern password standards are

2608
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:05,280
complexity aside longer password is

2609
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:07,320
better uh some quick stats on how

2610
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:08,820
quickly or how long it would take to

2611
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:10,380
break one of those passwords and just a

2612
02:14:10,380 --> 02:14:11,940
reminder white space is considered a

2613
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:13,920
character

2614
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,280
so we configurations what else can we do

2615
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,020
a lot of organizations are going to put

2616
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:21,360
out benchmarks but you're also going to

2617
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:23,159
see CIS a lot of organizations and

2618
02:14:23,159 --> 02:14:24,960
companies are no longer even writing

2619
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,579
their own benchmarks here's the link to

2620
02:14:26,579 --> 02:14:28,920
CIS come do what they say to do it's

2621
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:31,380
going to give you a step-by-step

2622
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:34,199
breakdown so CIS for those that don't

2623
02:14:34,199 --> 02:14:35,820
know it's a global non-profit it was

2624
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:38,639
founded in 2000 it also operates the MSI

2625
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:41,639
Sac major companies tenable like tenable

2626
02:14:41,639 --> 02:14:42,780
doesn't write their own benchmarks

2627
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:45,000
anymore like nessus they Point

2628
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,179
everything to CIS

2629
02:14:47,179 --> 02:14:49,679
but if you're going through these please

2630
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:52,500
note that a lot of them are very

2631
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:54,599
extensive it's going to walk you through

2632
02:14:54,599 --> 02:14:56,520
every single setting and configuration

2633
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:59,159
in that environment so the last I looked

2634
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:01,980
like the Windows Server 2019 guide was

2635
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:04,020
over a thousand pages long

2636
02:15:04,020 --> 02:15:06,300
these are things that Consultants like

2637
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:08,219
me and my firm we would love to come in

2638
02:15:08,219 --> 02:15:09,780
and help do these things but we're also

2639
02:15:09,780 --> 02:15:10,860
going to tell people here's the

2640
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:13,260
resources that you can do this yourself

2641
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:15,000
I get it you don't have the resources or

2642
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,579
the manpower to do it but if you do uh

2643
02:15:17,579 --> 02:15:19,020
these are totally things that you can do

2644
02:15:19,020 --> 02:15:20,940
yourself and these are there's resources

2645
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:22,560
out there that are free and open to you

2646
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,659
that you don't necessarily need to pay a

2647
02:15:24,659 --> 02:15:26,880
lot of money we work with organizations

2648
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:29,460
anywhere from you know small non-profits

2649
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:32,219
where the nonprofit director is HR and

2650
02:15:32,219 --> 02:15:36,000
I.T and the CEO to large Enterprises

2651
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,280
with 30 40 000 employees

2652
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:42,119
so you can also find guides for other

2653
02:15:42,119 --> 02:15:46,500
cloud services Azure AWS gcp Oracle

2654
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:47,699
um you know this is another thing that

2655
02:15:47,699 --> 02:15:49,679
you can do that does not require hacking

2656
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:52,020
skills this is something that you could

2657
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:55,020
set an intern with you don't need

2658
02:15:55,020 --> 02:15:57,060
Advanced skills to say hey this is the

2659
02:15:57,060 --> 02:15:59,040
system go through and start making these

2660
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,659
configurations but of course do it in a

2661
02:16:02,659 --> 02:16:04,920
mindset that you're considering change

2662
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:07,440
management don't go wild west on this

2663
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:09,780
and start making changes in prod think

2664
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:11,579
about how your changes are going to

2665
02:16:11,579 --> 02:16:13,800
affect your end users

2666
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:15,480
um you don't want to make processes that

2667
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:18,300
are overburdened and change things that

2668
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,739
in a way that's going to affect the end

2669
02:16:19,739 --> 02:16:21,239
User make sure you're following your

2670
02:16:21,239 --> 02:16:22,320
processes

2671
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:24,300
um but you know also verify your Source

2672
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:26,520
make sure it's a reputable Source going

2673
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:29,460
to CIS uh if you want something that's a

2674
02:16:29,460 --> 02:16:31,079
little bit more secure you can look at

2675
02:16:31,079 --> 02:16:33,898
dsa's stigs so if you're looking at like

2676
02:16:33,898 --> 02:16:36,840
a security level CIS are great their

2677
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:38,218
benchmarks are fantastic but if you want

2678
02:16:38,218 --> 02:16:39,780
something a little bit more robust more

2679
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:42,540
secure you can look at DC stigs

2680
02:16:42,540 --> 02:16:44,700


2681
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:46,379
um some things that will not be in CIS

2682
02:16:46,379 --> 02:16:48,540
that you may have to dig for a little

2683
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:50,638
bit more might be some stuff like

2684
02:16:50,638 --> 02:16:53,580
Microsoft Azure devops GitHub oauth

2685
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:55,558
recommendations o wasp is another great

2686
02:16:55,558 --> 02:16:57,299
resource from some things some

2687
02:16:57,299 --> 02:16:59,160
development systems that may not be

2688
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:02,700
covered by Center for Internet Security

2689
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:05,398
so again just step by step some things

2690
02:17:05,398 --> 02:17:06,780
that we'd really like to call out you

2691
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:10,080
know again the SMB signing is huge

2692
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:12,359
um and it's just you know this is what a

2693
02:17:12,359 --> 02:17:13,799
portal might look like if you're going

2694
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:16,500
through that step by step

2695
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:18,299
so that's prioritization and

2696
02:17:18,299 --> 02:17:20,040
communication next in our third pillar

2697
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:22,260
is regular accountability

2698
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:25,920
your finding bones you've had a risk

2699
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:27,179
assessment done

2700
02:17:27,179 --> 02:17:29,340
what are you doing next are you meeting

2701
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:31,679
regularly to discuss progress are you

2702
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:34,200
identifying the obstacles and adjusting

2703
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,599
that remediation strategy

2704
02:17:36,599 --> 02:17:38,160
um you know effectively

2705
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,780
and then also how are you communicating

2706
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:41,459
progress to leadership

2707
02:17:41,459 --> 02:17:43,500
so many times and part of what I love

2708
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,500
about my job is having moments and

2709
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,179
opportunities to help it teams tell

2710
02:17:48,179 --> 02:17:50,280
their stories a lot of the times we're

2711
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:52,679
quiet we're in the background people

2712
02:17:52,679 --> 02:17:55,439
know when things go wrong but they don't

2713
02:17:55,439 --> 02:17:56,939
know all the things that we're doing

2714
02:17:56,939 --> 02:17:59,879
well so what are the steps that we can

2715
02:17:59,879 --> 02:18:02,638
take to tell leadership this is what

2716
02:18:02,638 --> 02:18:04,320
we're doing this is how we're serving

2717
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:07,760
this is how we're protecting you

2718
02:18:07,859 --> 02:18:10,080
um so again you can approve what you

2719
02:18:10,080 --> 02:18:13,620
don't measure tenable rapid seven qualis

2720
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:15,200
those are all going to give you

2721
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:17,820
real-time snapshots they are not going

2722
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:20,580
to retain historical data if you want to

2723
02:18:20,580 --> 02:18:23,580
be able to tell your story and know how

2724
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:26,280
you can improve measure what you want to

2725
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:28,978
change you have to do some data

2726
02:18:28,978 --> 02:18:30,898
analytics you have to do some data

2727
02:18:30,898 --> 02:18:33,420
capturing and do some measures

2728
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:35,519
uh and then also thinking about how

2729
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:37,500
you're going to gauge exploitability you

2730
02:18:37,500 --> 02:18:39,240
know what is that defense posture

2731
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:41,280
against moderate attackers and how do we

2732
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:42,959
really be effective on reducing

2733
02:18:42,959 --> 02:18:45,179
exploitable weaknesses

2734
02:18:45,179 --> 02:18:46,620
um this is some graphs just straight

2735
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:48,780
from Power bi been anonymized from some

2736
02:18:48,780 --> 02:18:50,760
of our clients um so what we'll do is

2737
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:52,379
like we'll track uh end-of-life

2738
02:18:52,379 --> 02:18:55,260
operating systems over a time period and

2739
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,179
again this is dummy data so we can see a

2740
02:18:57,179 --> 02:18:58,799
breakdown of different EOL operating

2741
02:18:58,799 --> 02:19:00,660
systems it seems like every week a new

2742
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:04,320
flavor of Windows 10 is becoming EOL

2743
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:06,660
um and you know a Gambit of other older

2744
02:19:06,660 --> 02:19:08,340
Windows operating systems there but we

2745
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:11,099
can see slow steady progress right we

2746
02:19:11,099 --> 02:19:12,840
haven't fully remediated all of our

2747
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:15,080
Legacy os's but we're making progress

2748
02:19:15,080 --> 02:19:18,120
and that's the that's the key to all of

2749
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:19,859
this um the previous speaker made a

2750
02:19:19,859 --> 02:19:21,179
comment about you're never going to have

2751
02:19:21,179 --> 02:19:22,859
zero risk same thing with

2752
02:19:22,859 --> 02:19:25,500
vulnerabilities there are so many coming

2753
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:29,519
out you're never going to have zero

2754
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:31,500
but how are we constantly making

2755
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:33,500
progress and improving our environment

2756
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:36,599
uh some other tracking here you know

2757
02:19:36,599 --> 02:19:38,519
overall vulnerabilities by month how

2758
02:19:38,519 --> 02:19:40,978
does that change and there's you know a

2759
02:19:40,978 --> 02:19:42,478
Gambit of you know different lists on

2760
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:45,058
the top left there blue keep was a big

2761
02:19:45,058 --> 02:19:48,599
one log log for Shell unsupported Adobe

2762
02:19:48,599 --> 02:19:51,359
Reader that's sometimes you get into a

2763
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:53,880
business uh situation where oh I can

2764
02:19:53,880 --> 02:19:56,340
open PDFs I'm just fine and Adobe has

2765
02:19:56,340 --> 02:19:57,840
killed off licensing it's not supposed

2766
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:00,120
to work anymore but you know have we

2767
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:02,640
actually went to a modern licensing uh

2768
02:20:02,640 --> 02:20:05,100
long term the better you communicate and

2769
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:07,080
tell your team story The more leadership

2770
02:20:07,080 --> 02:20:09,180
is going to understand your work and

2771
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:12,180
ultimately invest in security not just

2772
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:14,520
monetarily but also through policy

2773
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:17,280
enforcement there are so many times that

2774
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,560
organizations might have good policy and

2775
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:22,220
procedure but maybe they make exceptions

2776
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:24,840
I worked in an organization where we

2777
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:26,580
implemented rules about screen savers

2778
02:20:26,580 --> 02:20:28,920
because screensavers allow you to bypass

2779
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:32,100
screen lock security mechanisms but we

2780
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:34,620
had a director that had our own little

2781
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:38,040
meeting space in our office and she had

2782
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:41,220
a TV connected to a computer and she had

2783
02:20:41,220 --> 02:20:42,660
to have a little fish aquarium

2784
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:44,460
screensaver on her computer

2785
02:20:44,460 --> 02:20:47,520
so one of the most targeted people in

2786
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:48,960
the organization that would be

2787
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:50,280
spearfished

2788
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:52,920
we let have a security exception so she

2789
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:54,660
could have a fun little fish aquarium in

2790
02:20:54,660 --> 02:20:57,479
her personal conference room

2791
02:20:57,479 --> 02:20:59,599
um

2792
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:01,740
maybe some bitterness and a little bit

2793
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:03,600
of jadedness is coming across even in

2794
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:04,859
the Stream we'll see

2795
02:21:04,859 --> 02:21:06,300
um but you know all of this to say the

2796
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:08,040
more leadership understands and supports

2797
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:11,220
security and how everyone really plays a

2798
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:13,800
piece in it in some form or fashion it's

2799
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:16,319
going to better enable you to thwart

2800
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:18,240
hackers and those attacks upon your

2801
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:19,680
systems

2802
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:21,479
um so an interesting story that I want

2803
02:21:21,479 --> 02:21:22,859
to share with you guys and just a tidbit

2804
02:21:22,859 --> 02:21:25,680
that you might find useful we see a lot

2805
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:28,740
of EOL server 2008.

2806
02:21:28,740 --> 02:21:31,800
um so off the cuff you may only consider

2807
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:33,660
upgrading the operating system you know

2808
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:36,600
part of the process of vulnerability

2809
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:39,180
management and risk management is having

2810
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:42,120
a realistic approach to what can we do

2811
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:44,040
maybe it's too big of an impact to

2812
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:46,680
upgrade server 2008 maybe we can't do a

2813
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:49,020
lift and shift into Azure maybe or maybe

2814
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:51,060
you can or maybe it's a legacy

2815
02:21:51,060 --> 02:21:53,460
application and we can't afford the

2816
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:56,040
resources whether it's people or money

2817
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:58,439
or time to also upgrade the application

2818
02:21:58,439 --> 02:22:00,420
rewrite code because we've got to

2819
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:03,000
upgrade the application so what can we

2820
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,439
do it's not going to function on a newer

2821
02:22:04,439 --> 02:22:05,600
OS

2822
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:08,340
Microsoft is actually taken a little bit

2823
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:11,220
of a Brilliance dance on this it's one

2824
02:22:11,220 --> 02:22:12,660
of the most beautiful marketing things

2825
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:14,520
I've seen them do

2826
02:22:14,520 --> 02:22:17,220
if you lift and shift Azure or Windows

2827
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:19,859
Server 2008 into Azure they're extending

2828
02:22:19,859 --> 02:22:21,300
support

2829
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:23,819
you got an on-prem physical server no

2830
02:22:23,819 --> 02:22:25,319
they're not going to support it anymore

2831
02:22:25,319 --> 02:22:27,600
but if you put it in Azure where you're

2832
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:30,180
most likely to not move it out then

2833
02:22:30,180 --> 02:22:31,800
you've got extended support through uh

2834
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:34,380
2024. so even when you have

2835
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:37,080
accountability something as simple as a

2836
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:39,060
regular meeting where you can discuss

2837
02:22:39,060 --> 02:22:41,640
stuff like this with your peers gives

2838
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:43,020
you the opportunity to come up with

2839
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:45,960
creative Creative Solutions you know

2840
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:47,580
it's not always oh man we're stuck with

2841
02:22:47,580 --> 02:22:48,720
this because we got this Legacy

2842
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,460
application and no one will invest money

2843
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:52,620
to buy the new application and then the

2844
02:22:52,620 --> 02:22:54,780
huge project to do everything that we

2845
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:56,220
need to do to make it functional on a

2846
02:22:56,220 --> 02:22:57,960
new operating system or find a new

2847
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:00,600
solution there's lots of different ways

2848
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:02,520
that we can remediate vulnerabilities

2849
02:23:02,520 --> 02:23:04,560
buy ourselves a little extra time

2850
02:23:04,560 --> 02:23:06,660
whether it's something like this or it's

2851
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:08,460
some type of other compensating control

2852
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:10,740
that reduces the likelihood of that

2853
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:14,119
vulnerability being exploited

2854
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:15,780
um this is the basic vulnerability

2855
02:23:15,780 --> 02:23:18,660
management maturity scale generally what

2856
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:21,479
we see is people begin with

2857
02:23:21,479 --> 02:23:22,680
um

2858
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:24,720
looking at patch management

2859
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,819
that's your basis establishing patch

2860
02:23:26,819 --> 02:23:29,520
management we see a lot of clients that

2861
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:31,319
have established some sort of security

2862
02:23:31,319 --> 02:23:33,680
program or more in that defined area

2863
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:36,120
they have some periodic credentialed

2864
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:37,740
bone scanning

2865
02:23:37,740 --> 02:23:39,840
maybe a periodic pen test but what are

2866
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:41,819
they actually doing for remediation what

2867
02:23:41,819 --> 02:23:42,840
we want to do is we want to get

2868
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:44,460
everybody into this optimized State

2869
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:47,280
you're doing regular credentialed and

2870
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:49,620
internal scanning as well as external

2871
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:50,580
scanning you're getting both

2872
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:52,260
perspectives right what's the true

2873
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:54,420
external malicious actor seeing and if

2874
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:55,680
they get that foothold in the network

2875
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:58,200
what are they seeing after that we want

2876
02:23:58,200 --> 02:23:59,760
to be able to track performance metrics

2877
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:02,460
and then also we're remediating not just

2878
02:24:02,460 --> 02:24:05,700
on that CVS score but what is actually

2879
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:07,680
being exploited in real time what are

2880
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,300
those things that are ridiculously easy

2881
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:11,040
to exploit whether you're a script Kitty

2882
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:13,560
or an advanced pin tester

2883
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:14,640
um

2884
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:17,040
so what all are preventative measures

2885
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,780
how do we reduce weaknesses

2886
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:21,540
vulnerabilities and risks from the start

2887
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:23,580
um we see a lot of time there's safety

2888
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:24,479
third

2889
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:26,340
and Safety and Security can be

2890
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:28,680
interchanged a lot and you might lose

2891
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:30,720
some digits if you're doing security or

2892
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:33,120
safety third so bring Security First

2893
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:36,120
help your organization get in that

2894
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:38,700
mindset that security in it is here to

2895
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:41,640
help you not hinder you all too often

2896
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:43,500
they see oh you won't let me pay my

2897
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:45,359
bills while I'm at work I can't go

2898
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:47,640
shopping while I'm at work why are you

2899
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:49,200
stopping me from doing these things why

2900
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:51,120
did you make my process go from three

2901
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:52,920
clicks to five clicks

2902
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:55,380
help your teams and your organization

2903
02:24:55,380 --> 02:24:57,899
know that it is there to help you you

2904
02:24:57,899 --> 02:24:59,880
know if something goes wrong with a

2905
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:01,800
rocket launch

2906
02:25:01,800 --> 02:25:03,780
and there's a security or a safety issue

2907
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:06,600
does Nasa say oh let's just send them

2908
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:08,939
into space anyways you know it's like a

2909
02:25:08,939 --> 02:25:10,920
9 out of 10 risk we'll just roll the

2910
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:13,319
dice we can accept that one right

2911
02:25:13,319 --> 02:25:15,660
um no they scrub the mission they fix it

2912
02:25:15,660 --> 02:25:17,399
and then they go back and then they

2913
02:25:17,399 --> 02:25:19,680
actually go ahead so some of these

2914
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,060
things we've talked about along the way

2915
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:22,859
if you've got a weakness of default

2916
02:25:22,859 --> 02:25:25,979
credentials deploy some standards create

2917
02:25:25,979 --> 02:25:29,580
a checklist create policy and actually

2918
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:31,979
take that policy and then implement the

2919
02:25:31,979 --> 02:25:34,140
technical controls that enforce that

2920
02:25:34,140 --> 02:25:37,319
policy do you step-by-step requirements

2921
02:25:37,319 --> 02:25:39,000
that have to be completed do your

2922
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,460
periodic reviews and testing you know

2923
02:25:41,460 --> 02:25:44,220
how can your management help you set

2924
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:46,200
aside dedicated time to do these things

2925
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:47,580
I know a lot of people are like I'd love

2926
02:25:47,580 --> 02:25:48,960
to do these things but I don't have time

2927
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:50,700
to do them you have to have supportive

2928
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:52,439
Executives and Leadership that carve out

2929
02:25:52,439 --> 02:25:54,180
time and see the importance of doing

2930
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:56,880
these you know have you do you have an

2931
02:25:56,880 --> 02:25:57,960
inventory

2932
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:00,120
if you don't know what all your assets

2933
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:01,859
are how can you be certain that you're

2934
02:26:01,859 --> 02:26:04,580
protecting them

2935
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:06,000
um you know it's the whole concept of

2936
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,340
you can't protect what you don't know

2937
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,800
that you have and that periodic testing

2938
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:12,120
is going to help you identify those

2939
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:14,100
devices that may not be getting patches

2940
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:16,740
we've seen issues where hey we've got 10

2941
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:18,600
systems that are missing this patch and

2942
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:20,220
that patch and that patch and we go back

2943
02:26:20,220 --> 02:26:21,660
and look and maybe it's a cumulative

2944
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:24,240
update they've got patch one and now

2945
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:25,500
they're trying to get patch three but

2946
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:27,120
they've missed patch two

2947
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:28,979
how do we get other teams involved to go

2948
02:26:28,979 --> 02:26:30,300
out and actually inspect and figure out

2949
02:26:30,300 --> 02:26:31,920
what's happening immediate leads to

2950
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:35,340
discovery about bigger issues and

2951
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:36,960
without doing those periodic and regular

2952
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:38,399
testing Communications accountability

2953
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:39,600
you're not going to discover those

2954
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:41,040
things that could affect things not only

2955
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:43,439
outside of iot but also the business as

2956
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:45,180
a whole

2957
02:26:45,180 --> 02:26:46,979
um so again management support is

2958
02:26:46,979 --> 02:26:48,840
crucial for these

2959
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:49,500
um

2960
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:51,420
unless you know you've got a really good

2961
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:53,580
incident response program or a good mmsp

2962
02:26:53,580 --> 02:26:55,260
and you're just prepared to financially

2963
02:26:55,260 --> 02:26:57,720
respond all of your incidents that may

2964
02:26:57,720 --> 02:27:00,020
come as a result of not following these

2965
02:27:00,020 --> 02:27:02,280
another concept that I wanted to leave

2966
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:04,680
you guys with because I found that it

2967
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:06,840
drives home really well with people who

2968
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:09,780
are not Tech and especially not security

2969
02:27:09,780 --> 02:27:11,580
is this is a basic cyber security

2970
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:13,080
triangle you're going to see this most

2971
02:27:13,080 --> 02:27:15,859
likely in any cyber security 101 class

2972
02:27:15,859 --> 02:27:19,380
so the idea is in a happy world you

2973
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:21,000
would have a little dot in the very

2974
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:22,920
middle of this triangle a nice little

2975
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:24,479
balance of security functionality

2976
02:27:24,479 --> 02:27:27,840
usability but if we think about this

2977
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:30,120
the most secure computer they in the

2978
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:31,740
world so if we take our little Dot from

2979
02:27:31,740 --> 02:27:32,760
the middle and move it to the tip top

2980
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:35,160
where the security it's a computer that

2981
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:37,800
you never turn on it has zero

2982
02:27:37,800 --> 02:27:40,380
functionality zero usability so how do

2983
02:27:40,380 --> 02:27:42,960
we help Executives understand we turn on

2984
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:45,780
the computer you need to have antivirus

2985
02:27:45,780 --> 02:27:48,300
you get on the internet you need a web

2986
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:52,020
filter you get email every use and every

2987
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:54,420
functionality that you have you have to

2988
02:27:54,420 --> 02:27:58,979
have a compensating security control

2989
02:27:58,979 --> 02:28:00,600
um another analogy that I've seen that

2990
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:02,700
helps very well with end users is

2991
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:05,220
substitute security and safety and think

2992
02:28:05,220 --> 02:28:07,859
about driving maybe you drove here or

2993
02:28:07,859 --> 02:28:09,420
you took public transit to get to the

2994
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:11,340
conference today would you get in that

2995
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:13,740
vehicle and take it somewhere if it

2996
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:17,280
didn't have brakes or a seat belt go a

2997
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:19,200
step further and think about specialized

2998
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:21,000
systems so maybe you have systems that

2999
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,340
work that are accessing PCI Data or

3000
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:25,319
HIPAA data those are specialized systems

3001
02:28:25,319 --> 02:28:27,000
running or even OT thinking about

3002
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,399
operational technology rather than

3003
02:28:29,399 --> 02:28:31,380
Information Technology what do those

3004
02:28:31,380 --> 02:28:34,680
systems look like and equate that to

3005
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:36,780
driving and think about like Formula One

3006
02:28:36,780 --> 02:28:38,040
and NASCAR

3007
02:28:38,040 --> 02:28:39,600
those specialized systems those

3008
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:41,340
specialized Vehicles not only have

3009
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:43,439
brakes and seat belts the drivers have

3010
02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:45,120
to wear helmets they have to wear fire

3011
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:46,859
suits you have Emergency Medical

3012
02:28:46,859 --> 02:28:49,560
Services on standby this is an analogy

3013
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:50,880
that I found that works really well with

3014
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:52,680
end users at all levels and then also

3015
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:54,260
Executives so helping them understand

3016
02:28:54,260 --> 02:28:57,479
that yes we took your process from three

3017
02:28:57,479 --> 02:28:59,700
clicks to five clicks yes you have to

3018
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:01,620
log in with not just a username but you

3019
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:04,439
also have to do MFA that's reducing your

3020
02:29:04,439 --> 02:29:05,640
functionality it's reducing your

3021
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:07,319
usability but it's adding the security

3022
02:29:07,319 --> 02:29:09,000
in place that we need to have for

3023
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,700
today's environment

3024
02:29:10,700 --> 02:29:13,380
and that's the end of my presentation

3025
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:15,359
I've got some contact information here

3026
02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:18,300
if you guys want to connect with me or

3027
02:29:18,300 --> 02:29:20,939
my firm but are there any questions from

3028
02:29:20,939 --> 02:29:23,160
the crowd

3029
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:24,540
yeah

3030
02:29:24,540 --> 02:29:27,140
shoot

3031
02:29:32,700 --> 02:29:35,359
Packers

3032
02:29:42,899 --> 02:29:46,439
it can be okay well the question is uh

3033
02:29:46,439 --> 02:29:48,180
the slide that we had about like with

3034
02:29:48,180 --> 02:29:50,220
the sisa distribution background uh

3035
02:29:50,220 --> 02:29:51,479
there was let's see let me get back here

3036
02:29:51,479 --> 02:29:53,160
so we can see it

3037
02:29:53,160 --> 02:29:54,720
um and it was you know thinking about

3038
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,939
attackers and not going after the 10 out

3039
02:29:56,939 --> 02:30:00,180
of 10 CVS scores and really looking at

3040
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:02,640
you know the five to eight range of CBS

3041
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:03,780
scores

3042
02:30:03,780 --> 02:30:05,760
and you know is it kind of playing a cat

3043
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:07,439
and mouse game of what you're choosing

3044
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:09,240
and the answer is yes

3045
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:12,000
uh you are playing a cat and mouse game

3046
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:13,439
you're you're doing a little bit of

3047
02:30:13,439 --> 02:30:15,180
whack-a-mole I've got a whole I've got

3048
02:30:15,180 --> 02:30:16,920
an exploit I've got a vulnerability here

3049
02:30:16,920 --> 02:30:18,600
let's smash it another one's gonna pop

3050
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:21,300
up so when we're talking about 25 000

3051
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:22,920
new vulnerabilities discovered last year

3052
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:24,780
on track to have the same amount or more

3053
02:30:24,780 --> 02:30:27,060
discovered this year it's going to be a

3054
02:30:27,060 --> 02:30:29,520
constant battle but what you do is you

3055
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,859
layer your perspective it's thinking how

3056
02:30:31,859 --> 02:30:33,720
do I prioritize

3057
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:36,720
and you can't look at just a CVS score

3058
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:38,160
alone you have to look at your

3059
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:39,780
environment and then you have to get

3060
02:30:39,780 --> 02:30:41,720
that perspective what's actually being

3061
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:44,100
exploited and that's where the sisa

3062
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:45,899
catalog comes in as you can see hey what

3063
02:30:45,899 --> 02:30:47,939
is actually known that someone did this

3064
02:30:47,939 --> 02:30:50,160
exploit and was able to breach a system

3065
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:53,040
and then you also layer in that red team

3066
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:55,740
ethical hacker perspective you know what

3067
02:30:55,740 --> 02:30:58,260
is actually likely that I could do this

3068
02:30:58,260 --> 02:30:59,939
hack so if you see something you know

3069
02:30:59,939 --> 02:31:01,800
like the SMB signing or the null

3070
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:03,600
sessions that's lower in the middle of

3071
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:06,120
the score but then also thinking about

3072
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:10,560
your it team and what's easy to fix

3073
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:11,819
um you know can I knock out a

3074
02:31:11,819 --> 02:31:13,560
vulnerability just by pushing out a

3075
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:15,899
group policy update and that's a heck of

3076
02:31:15,899 --> 02:31:18,120
a lot easier than going to Executives

3077
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:20,700
and telling them I need five or six

3078
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:23,640
figures added to my budget to replace a

3079
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:25,140
system

3080
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:28,560
um so it's a balance and it's thinking

3081
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:30,479
about slow steady progress

3082
02:31:30,479 --> 02:31:32,399
you know what can you any type of

3083
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:34,740
progress is good you're never going to

3084
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:36,240
be able to remediate any everything

3085
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:38,280
whether it's a vulnerability or a risk

3086
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:40,920
that's been identified so it's a balance

3087
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:42,840
and figuring out what's right for you

3088
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:43,979
and considering all those different

3089
02:31:43,979 --> 02:31:46,380
perspectives uh does does that answer

3090
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:50,779
your question all right yeah yes sir

3091
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:11,340
okay so the question is

3092
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:12,000
um

3093
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,580
ultimately who should be responsible for

3094
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:18,479
risk decisions or who what actions are

3095
02:32:18,479 --> 02:32:20,880
you taking so if an incident does happen

3096
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:23,640
where oh my gosh we got hit and there's

3097
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:25,260
this vulnerability that was a 10 out of

3098
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:28,080
10. we knew it was in our environment

3099
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:30,359
who's accepted that risk and the answer

3100
02:32:30,359 --> 02:32:33,780
is yes there should be an individual

3101
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,880
um I I personally don't think it should

3102
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:39,899
be in I.T unless it's an executive level

3103
02:32:39,899 --> 02:32:40,800
um

3104
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:43,080
to me that comes back to policy and

3105
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:45,240
procedure each organization needs to

3106
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:47,880
figure out what works best and what is

3107
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:49,800
right for them so when you have that

3108
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:51,479
Foundation of good policy and procedure

3109
02:32:51,479 --> 02:32:53,220
you outline roles and responsibilities

3110
02:32:53,220 --> 02:32:55,680
you have a defined risk management or a

3111
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:57,780
vulnerability Management program and we

3112
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:00,240
say here's how this is going to go and

3113
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:01,680
you know maybe like even the same thing

3114
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:04,020
with change management you have a

3115
02:33:04,020 --> 02:33:05,819
standardized process we say okay we're

3116
02:33:05,819 --> 02:33:07,680
going to have our patch Tuesdays and on

3117
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:09,600
patch Tuesdays we're going to patch

3118
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:12,300
regular maintenance items but then what

3119
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:14,340
is our plan for zero days when those

3120
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:16,439
patches come out so for me it's about

3121
02:33:16,439 --> 02:33:18,240
having definition and it's whatever

3122
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:20,040
works for you if you have an I.T

3123
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:22,620
position and Executives decide yes we

3124
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:25,020
want it to make that decision then

3125
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:26,939
absolutely if that what works for you

3126
02:33:26,939 --> 02:33:29,340
and that organization great ultimately I

3127
02:33:29,340 --> 02:33:31,439
would like to see executive support and

3128
02:33:31,439 --> 02:33:33,240
it would be another executive at a C

3129
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:35,840
Level or a risk management director

3130
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:38,280
saying this is an acceptable level of

3131
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:41,100
risk because you're not just looking at

3132
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:43,500
the risk to

3133
02:33:43,500 --> 02:33:45,300
someone getting in your network and data

3134
02:33:45,300 --> 02:33:47,700
potentially being exposed I think a lot

3135
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:49,920
of the times Executives think okay well

3136
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:52,380
there's the monetary value what is it in

3137
02:33:52,380 --> 02:33:55,800
the monetary value of a data breach but

3138
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:58,200
how do you monetize the reputational

3139
02:33:58,200 --> 02:33:59,700
impact

3140
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:02,280
and you know think about organizations

3141
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:03,479
that

3142
02:34:03,479 --> 02:34:05,160
um how many people were using solarwinds

3143
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:07,620
but you don't anymore

3144
02:34:07,620 --> 02:34:09,960
what's the reputational impact and the

3145
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:13,020
long-term look at your business and the

3146
02:34:13,020 --> 02:34:15,180
other piece is for me anyways is getting

3147
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:16,439
Executives to understand I've had

3148
02:34:16,439 --> 02:34:17,819
clients tell me oh we don't care if any

3149
02:34:17,819 --> 02:34:19,740
of our data gets out there

3150
02:34:19,740 --> 02:34:21,420
and

3151
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:23,580
nobody's going to come after us and

3152
02:34:23,580 --> 02:34:26,040
hackers are no longer going after Boeing

3153
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:27,960
looking for a top secret missile plans

3154
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:29,819
or something like that to sell on the

3155
02:34:29,819 --> 02:34:31,620
dark web it's it's not what you see in

3156
02:34:31,620 --> 02:34:34,620
the Spy movies it's the concept of how

3157
02:34:34,620 --> 02:34:37,800
valuable is your data to you a few

3158
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:40,160
months ago an Electric Co-op in Colorado

3159
02:34:40,160 --> 02:34:44,460
was hacked and they lost like 90 percent

3160
02:34:44,460 --> 02:34:46,560
of their customer records

3161
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:48,720
and their customers couldn't pay their

3162
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:49,920
electric bill because they had switched

3163
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:51,960
everything online uh it only had their

3164
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:53,760
business side there's no record yet that

3165
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:55,800
actually hit the OT side like the power

3166
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:58,260
grid and everything but it's how do you

3167
02:34:58,260 --> 02:35:00,240
start recovering from that what are the

3168
02:35:00,240 --> 02:35:03,060
impacts of your reputation losing

3169
02:35:03,060 --> 02:35:06,600
business data and hackers are operating

3170
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:08,580
as Fortune 500 companies they're not

3171
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:10,200
looking to resell your data for the most

3172
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:12,300
part it's how valuable is your data to

3173
02:35:12,300 --> 02:35:14,760
you and will you pay that Ransom that's

3174
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:16,859
probably more than you asked for but is

3175
02:35:16,859 --> 02:35:20,540
is that cover it

3176
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:22,439
all right

3177
02:35:22,439 --> 02:35:24,899

um I've got about 13 years of experience

3202
02:43:41,640 --> 02:43:43,319
in the industry

3203

um from Oklahoma Oklahoma trained and

3204
02:43:45,359 --> 02:43:47,819
educated it's been about 10 years since

3205
02:43:47,819 --> 02:43:50,760
state government uh Gambit Litany of

3206
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:52,920
roles listed there I'm really proud to

3207
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:54,540
be a co-founder of besides Oklahoma and

3208
02:43:54,540 --> 02:43:56,280
I found him under of Chuck Lahoma which

3209
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:59,580
is a non-profit in Oklahoma a little bit

3210
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:01,500
about my company we're a small firm out

3211
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:03,359
of Tulsa Oklahoma specializing bone

3212
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:05,340
management pen testing risk assessments

3213
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:09,120
virtual CSO work so today we are going

3214
02:44:09,120 --> 02:44:13,640
to focus in on trust

3215
02:44:13,640 --> 02:44:17,460
being being trusted trusting others this

3216
02:44:17,460 --> 02:44:18,960
is a massive topic that could very

3217
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:22,140
easily be a two-day training session my

3218
02:44:22,140 --> 02:44:23,939
hope today is that by the end of this

3219
02:44:23,939 --> 02:44:26,340
talk you'll understand different types

3220
02:44:26,340 --> 02:44:28,800
of trust and how to quickly establish it

3221
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:31,620
with others keeping in mind that like

3222
02:44:31,620 --> 02:44:33,720
all things security you have black hat

3223
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:36,420
you have white hat there are as many

3224
02:44:36,420 --> 02:44:38,760
black hat reasons to establish trust as

3225
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:41,280
there are white so I strongly encourage

3226
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:42,840
you during this talk let your mind

3227
02:44:42,840 --> 02:44:45,120
Wonder think about those Evil Genius

3228
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:47,580
opportunities uh scenarios and

3229
02:44:47,580 --> 02:44:48,960
applications that you might leverage

3230
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:51,420
trust in a different uh in a different

3231
02:44:51,420 --> 02:44:52,979
way

3232
02:44:52,979 --> 02:44:54,479
so

3233
02:44:54,479 --> 02:44:57,899
um I'm not a psychologist I am a fan of

3234
02:44:57,899 --> 02:44:59,460
social engineering and physical pen

3235
02:44:59,460 --> 02:45:01,080
testing I've never actually been paid to

3236
02:45:01,080 --> 02:45:02,819
do physical pin testing I've won social

3237
02:45:02,819 --> 02:45:04,260
engineering challenges and stuff at

3238
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:06,600
various conferences but again I haven't

3239
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:08,220
done this professionally so this is all

3240
02:45:08,220 --> 02:45:11,280
just internal experience

3241
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:12,420
um so I think it's different to

3242
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:14,160
understand the cycle the psychology

3243
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:16,380
background of trust and psychological

3244
02:45:16,380 --> 02:45:19,020
safety where trust is actually a

3245
02:45:19,020 --> 02:45:21,840
component of psychological safety it's

3246
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:24,660
personal it's individual it facilitates

3247
02:45:24,660 --> 02:45:27,300
questioning and risk taking the more you

3248
02:45:27,300 --> 02:45:29,399
trust someone or feel trusted by them

3249
02:45:29,399 --> 02:45:31,620
the bigger risk you'll take it's why

3250
02:45:31,620 --> 02:45:33,540
kids have no sense of fear around their

3251
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:36,899
parents they do crazy things because

3252
02:45:36,899 --> 02:45:40,380
they trust that no matter what they do

3253
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:42,780
that parent is going to protect them and

3254
02:45:42,780 --> 02:45:44,180
take care of them

3255
02:45:44,180 --> 02:45:46,140
understanding and taking consideration

3256
02:45:46,140 --> 02:45:49,140
of trust factors can increase the trust

3257
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:52,200
that other people have in you and it can

3258
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:53,640
change your relation friendships and

3259
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:54,840
interactions in every respect

3260
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:56,819
professionally it can improve the

3261
02:45:56,819 --> 02:45:58,560
success of your Social Engineering

3262
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:00,960
strategies and your pretenses can

3263
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:03,359
increase sales through better client

3264
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:05,700
experience and Customer Loyalty I can

3265
02:46:05,700 --> 02:46:07,859
prove your team's productivity and

3266
02:46:07,859 --> 02:46:10,580
reduce turnover

3267
02:46:10,620 --> 02:46:12,540
um so two main types of trust

3268
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:15,180
cognitive trust effective trust short

3269
02:46:15,180 --> 02:46:18,540
version of this cognitive trust is Bob

3270
02:46:18,540 --> 02:46:21,120
has his sispy and 20 years of experience

3271
02:46:21,120 --> 02:46:24,240
his qualifications match our projects so

3272
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:27,600
I can trust him effective trust would be

3273
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:29,819
Bob looks like my cousin and I really

3274
02:46:29,819 --> 02:46:31,800
like my cousin Bob's got a really nice

3275
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:34,280
smile so I think I can trust him

3276
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:37,560
cognitive trust is you know capability

3277
02:46:37,560 --> 02:46:39,840
and consistency it's trusting someone

3278
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:44,220
because they they said that they follow

3279
02:46:44,220 --> 02:46:46,500
up with what they do so when I gave you

3280
02:46:46,500 --> 02:46:48,780
my credentials and my background at the

3281
02:46:48,780 --> 02:46:50,640
beginning of this presentation I

3282
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:52,740
attempted to establish cognitive trust

3283
02:46:52,740 --> 02:46:54,720
with you you should trust me because I

3284
02:46:54,720 --> 02:46:56,760
had this experience I've done these

3285
02:46:56,760 --> 02:46:58,620
things I've had this education this is

3286
02:46:58,620 --> 02:47:00,420
my skill set this is why you should care

3287
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:03,000
and Trust what I'm saying so by

3288
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:04,800
outlining this talks agenda and the

3289
02:47:04,800 --> 02:47:08,100
focus points I laid out consistency

3290
02:47:08,100 --> 02:47:09,780
this is what you're going to expect to

3291
02:47:09,780 --> 02:47:11,760
hear in this talk will I actually be

3292
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:13,680
consistent I think we're going to roll a

3293
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:15,000
D20

3294
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,220
um it's about you know most of us here

3295
02:47:17,220 --> 02:47:19,620
probably rely on cognitive trust coming

3296
02:47:19,620 --> 02:47:21,720
from a technical background do we have

3297
02:47:21,720 --> 02:47:23,580
the appropriate Knowledge and Skills are

3298
02:47:23,580 --> 02:47:26,280
we competent in our jobs you know our

3299
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:28,620
clients customers teammates they trust

3300
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:30,359
that we have the right skills and the

3301
02:47:30,359 --> 02:47:32,700
technical Acumen to build deploy

3302
02:47:32,700 --> 02:47:36,780
maintain and secure their systems but

3303
02:47:36,780 --> 02:47:39,180
while you might be capable are you

3304
02:47:39,180 --> 02:47:42,060
consistent are systems running smoothly

3305
02:47:42,060 --> 02:47:43,920
in your environment because you test

3306
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:45,660
patches before deployment or does

3307
02:47:45,660 --> 02:47:47,720
systems frequently crash

3308
02:47:47,720 --> 02:47:49,620
both of those things are being

3309
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:51,540
consistent working right all the time

3310
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:53,340
crashing all the time you're being

3311
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:56,040
consistent but how would it sway trust

3312
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:57,960
one way or another with your customers

3313
02:47:57,960 --> 02:48:01,819
or your clients if you're consistently

3314
02:48:01,819 --> 02:48:04,500
maintaining your systems do your clients

3315
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:06,479
and your customers begin to believe that

3316
02:48:06,479 --> 02:48:09,300
you care more and bleed over from that

3317
02:48:09,300 --> 02:48:11,280
cognitive trust to effective trust

3318
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:13,439
because they think that you care if

3319
02:48:13,439 --> 02:48:14,760
you're not maintaining their systems do

3320
02:48:14,760 --> 02:48:17,479
you really care do they trust you less

3321
02:48:17,479 --> 02:48:19,640
so in Oklahoma

3322
02:48:19,640 --> 02:48:22,260
it is

3323
02:48:22,260 --> 02:48:22,920
um

3324
02:48:22,920 --> 02:48:24,780
we got two main colleges Oklahoma State

3325
02:48:24,780 --> 02:48:28,080
University and Oklahoma University and

3326
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:30,540
at OU games they have a slogan it's

3327
02:48:30,540 --> 02:48:32,460
Boomer Sooner so somebody else out

3328
02:48:32,460 --> 02:48:34,500
Boomer you're gonna get sooner airports

3329
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:35,640
around the world people tell you you

3330
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:37,200
randomly yell out Boomer you're going to

3331
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:38,939
hear us sooner in return

3332
02:48:38,939 --> 02:48:42,180
how can you use that type of consistent

3333
02:48:42,180 --> 02:48:45,120
behavior in people for social

3334
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:46,740
engineering pretenses

3335
02:48:46,740 --> 02:48:48,720
if I'm in an environment and I want to

3336
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:50,160
misdirect someone or make their eyes

3337
02:48:50,160 --> 02:48:51,660
look somewhere else can I have a

3338
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:53,640
colleague Yale Boomer knowing someone's

3339
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:54,960
going to turn and go sooner and then

3340
02:48:54,960 --> 02:48:56,760
maybe I can sneak into a room or go

3341
02:48:56,760 --> 02:48:58,979
somewhere I'm not supposed to

3342
02:48:58,979 --> 02:49:01,380
um so you know think about uh you know

3343
02:49:01,380 --> 02:49:05,040
another consideration is what if you're

3344
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:07,680
hiring an entry-level security analyst

3345
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:10,439
what preconceptions would you have

3346
02:49:10,439 --> 02:49:12,600
against that person or towards that

3347
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:15,180
person what if you're new hires in their

3348
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:16,800
20s

3349
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:20,939
what if your new hire is in their 60s

3350
02:49:20,939 --> 02:49:23,340
both could be fresh out of college

3351
02:49:23,340 --> 02:49:25,920
same level of Education

3352
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:29,580
what type of inherent level of trust

3353
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:30,840
would you have with each of those

3354
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:33,660
different individuals

3355
02:49:33,660 --> 02:49:35,520
so again an effective trust we're

3356
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:37,500
thinking about

3357
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:40,800
emotion humans are naturally emotional

3358
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:43,800
creatures effective trust is also Trust

3359
02:49:43,800 --> 02:49:46,020
of the heart it's empathy trusting in

3360
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:49,020
someone's capacity for caring

3361
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:50,520
um it's less of a science because

3362
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:53,760
everyone has their own internal biases

3363
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:56,580
what inspires me to believe someone

3364
02:49:56,580 --> 02:49:58,800
cares and I should trust them is totally

3365
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:01,500
different from another individual but if

3366
02:50:01,500 --> 02:50:03,960
we think about these things and we

3367
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:06,380
Implement methods to establish

3368
02:50:06,380 --> 02:50:09,540
effective trust it goes beyond a normal

3369
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:12,660
relationship it builds a deeper bond

3370
02:50:12,660 --> 02:50:14,880
that leads to loyalty commitment

3371
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:18,359
devotion people will go measures Beyond

3372
02:50:18,359 --> 02:50:22,620
out of the ordinary for people that they

3373
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:23,700
believe

3374
02:50:23,700 --> 02:50:25,680
care about them and if you establish

3375
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:28,260
that effective trust so if systems are

3376
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:30,420
having you know there's more issues you

3377
02:50:30,420 --> 02:50:31,859
know does it really make people think

3378
02:50:31,859 --> 02:50:33,479
that you care more or less if you're not

3379
02:50:33,479 --> 02:50:34,979
maintaining their things properly in

3380
02:50:34,979 --> 02:50:37,800
their systems if you're able to maintain

3381
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:40,020
and improve operations do they have a

3382
02:50:40,020 --> 02:50:42,180
better mindset are they more likely to

3383
02:50:42,180 --> 02:50:43,979
listen to you when you're pitching hey

3384
02:50:43,979 --> 02:50:45,420
we've really got to make this change for

3385
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:47,520
security you're not just doing it

3386
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:49,500
because you're capable it's no longer

3387
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:51,420
you're doing it because it's technically

3388
02:50:51,420 --> 02:50:53,160
the right thing to do you're doing it

3389
02:50:53,160 --> 02:50:55,080
because you care you're bringing it up

3390
02:50:55,080 --> 02:50:56,520
because you care about the company and

3391
02:50:56,520 --> 02:50:58,880
The Business

3392
02:50:59,580 --> 02:51:01,740
um so why bother Trust

3393
02:51:01,740 --> 02:51:04,200
why bother with this at all and the

3394
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:06,660
answer really is we can't help it uh

3395
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:10,380
humans we are born physically premature

3396
02:51:10,380 --> 02:51:13,020
we are dependent upon our caretakers we

3397
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:14,880
cannot take care of ourselves we are

3398
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:18,660
hardwired to establish bonds and social

3399
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:20,819
connections trusting one another to

3400
02:51:20,819 --> 02:51:23,399
fulfill our needs we're born to engage

3401
02:51:23,399 --> 02:51:25,680
with others and that's really what trust

3402
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:27,479
is mostly about is how we engage with

3403
02:51:27,479 --> 02:51:30,359
people I'm an introvert so when I

3404
02:51:30,359 --> 02:51:31,979
started writing this talk and I wanted

3405
02:51:31,979 --> 02:51:33,720
to really focus on social engineering

3406
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:37,500
I'm I had this thought and

3407
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:40,319
I'm born to engage with others

3408
02:51:40,319 --> 02:51:43,800
am I really do I really want to engage

3409
02:51:43,800 --> 02:51:46,260
with a lot of people no I want to sit in

3410
02:51:46,260 --> 02:51:47,399
my own little space I want to write

3411
02:51:47,399 --> 02:51:48,600
reports I want to have minimal

3412
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:49,859
interaction when I'm interviewing people

3413
02:51:49,859 --> 02:51:52,200
for risk assessments but really the

3414
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:54,240
answer is yes I mean we want to engage

3415
02:51:54,240 --> 02:51:56,340
with other people and we might think

3416
02:51:56,340 --> 02:51:58,140
about introverts and texts and we don't

3417
02:51:58,140 --> 02:51:59,580
like to talk and we want to be in our

3418
02:51:59,580 --> 02:52:00,899
own little space but have you guys ever

3419
02:52:00,899 --> 02:52:03,359
been to Comic-Con or even events like

3420
02:52:03,359 --> 02:52:04,200
this

3421
02:52:04,200 --> 02:52:06,000
you get a little nerd that's sitting in

3422
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,859
their sock watching logs all day and

3423
02:52:07,859 --> 02:52:09,300
somebody comes up and asks them about

3424
02:52:09,300 --> 02:52:11,460
their job their eyes light up and they

3425
02:52:11,460 --> 02:52:13,979
will not stop talking someone wants to

3426
02:52:13,979 --> 02:52:15,960
talk about how like agility converts

3427
02:52:15,960 --> 02:52:18,420
into crit chances and doing Theory

3428
02:52:18,420 --> 02:52:20,460
crafting I'm gonna geek out and talk all

3429
02:52:20,460 --> 02:52:22,260
day to you about that even though I'm an

3430
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:23,580
introvert

3431
02:52:23,580 --> 02:52:25,140
um so even when people think that they

3432
02:52:25,140 --> 02:52:26,880
don't like people they're still that

3433
02:52:26,880 --> 02:52:30,120
intrinsic hard-wired need to connect and

3434
02:52:30,120 --> 02:52:31,979
engage with people

3435
02:52:31,979 --> 02:52:34,200
um so uh but you know what else can we

3436
02:52:34,200 --> 02:52:35,520
do with trust as adults and

3437
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:37,260
professionals why bother you know what

3438
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:39,359
do we really get back out of it and

3439
02:52:39,359 --> 02:52:40,859
here's you know a couple examples of

3440
02:52:40,859 --> 02:52:43,140
some things if you can quickly establish

3441
02:52:43,140 --> 02:52:44,700
trusts in an interview does it increase

3442
02:52:44,700 --> 02:52:45,960
the chances that you're going to get the

3443
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:47,760
job offer they trust that you're capable

3444
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:49,500
they trust that you care what are you

3445
02:52:49,500 --> 02:52:50,580
bringing to the table in the

3446
02:52:50,580 --> 02:52:52,859
organization can it increase Innovation

3447
02:52:52,859 --> 02:52:54,840
among your staff maybe your staff feel

3448
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:57,240
more comfortable to speak up they trust

3449
02:52:57,240 --> 02:52:59,220
you that this is a safe space to bring

3450
02:52:59,220 --> 02:53:01,560
up new and different ideas and then also

3451

02:53:41,220 --> 02:53:43,020
manipulate effective trust to your own

3471
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:44,040
advantage

3472

on the other end what that's going to do

3477
02:53:57,660 --> 02:53:59,640
is that's going to trigger so many

3478
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:01,319
different things psychologically in that

3479
02:54:01,319 --> 02:54:03,240
person's mind because everyone's had a

3480
02:54:03,240 --> 02:54:06,240

3491
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:28,319
day you're doing a social engineering

02:54:28,319 --> 02:54:30,240
pretense you're viching away and you

3493
02:54:30,240 --> 02:54:31,560
don't get the right person on the phone

3494
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:32,939
they're not going to fall for your

3495
02:54:32,939 --> 02:54:34,620
tactics hang up

3496
02:54:34,620 --> 02:54:37,319

02:54:37,319 --> 02:54:38,760
um you know just keep doing it till you

3498
02:54:38,760 --> 02:54:41,279
get the right profile to fit your attack

3499
02:54:41,279 --> 02:54:42,960
um you know in my last talk

3500
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:46,080
um I went into details of uh Uber being

3501
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:48,240
attacked and being hacked in September

3502
02:54:48,240 --> 02:54:50,880
so the way that worked they they fished

3503
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:52,560
for credentials when they got once they

3504
02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:54,899
fish for credentials they got stopped by

3505
02:54:54,899 --> 02:54:57,420
Duo once they were stopped by Duo

3506
02:54:57,420 --> 02:55:00,840
multi-factor authentication they did an

3507
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:03,359
exhaustion attack on Duo they started

3508
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:04,680
flooding everybody with Duo

3509
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:06,540
notifications so people knew that

3510
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:08,880
something was wrong they targeted one

3511
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:10,979
person and they called them on the phone

3512
02:55:10,979 --> 02:55:14,220
hey this is Joe and I.T we are having

3513
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:15,899
some issues with Duo today you probably

3514
02:55:15,899 --> 02:55:17,160
noticed

3515
02:55:17,160 --> 02:55:19,140
um to help us fix this we need you to

3516
02:55:19,140 --> 02:55:20,939
tell us what is the Dual authentication

3517
02:55:20,939 --> 02:55:22,979
code on your phone right now the person

3518
02:55:22,979 --> 02:55:25,500
gave them the authentication code they

3519
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:28,020
were able to get into Uber systems from

3520
02:55:28,020 --> 02:55:30,300
that standard user account the attacker

3521
02:55:30,300 --> 02:55:32,220
saw was able to access a Powershell

3522
02:55:32,220 --> 02:55:34,740
script that wound up being related to

3523
02:55:34,740 --> 02:55:38,819
their Pam their account manager and

3524
02:55:38,819 --> 02:55:40,920
there were credentials hard-coded in

3525
02:55:40,920 --> 02:55:43,140
that script so within that script they

3526
02:55:43,140 --> 02:55:44,640
immediately had access to a service

3527
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:47,040
account credential that had domain level

3528
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:48,840
credentials they could get into the Pam

3529
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:51,120
and give themselves access right to a

3530
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:52,979
various amount of systems

3531
02:55:52,979 --> 02:55:54,540
um you know what are your plans for the

3532
02:55:54,540 --> 02:55:56,160
weekend or holiday maybe you're talking

3533
02:55:56,160 --> 02:55:58,800
to people in the office and that little

3534
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:00,660
bit of a question begins to establish

3535
02:56:00,660 --> 02:56:02,279
hey I care about UNF that I want to know

3536
02:56:02,279 --> 02:56:04,680
what you're doing outside of work you

3537
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:07,319
can also mirror communication Styles you

3538
02:56:07,319 --> 02:56:10,880
know what are people's uh body language

3539
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:14,279
what is their Cadence or their style of

3540
02:56:14,279 --> 02:56:16,200
speaking you know telling an honest

3541
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:18,180
story that provokes empathy sometimes on

3542
02:56:18,180 --> 02:56:20,220
the sales side of the house you know you

3543
02:56:20,220 --> 02:56:21,960
can establish that empathy with a client

3544
02:56:21,960 --> 02:56:24,060
and telling them a story like hey yeah

3545
02:56:24,060 --> 02:56:25,439
I've went through this maybe they're

3546
02:56:25,439 --> 02:56:27,000
going through a breach tell them a

3547
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,160
similar War Story establish empathy I've

3548
02:56:29,160 --> 02:56:30,840
been in your shoes I know where you're

3549
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:32,939
at and people feel that connection they

3550
02:56:32,939 --> 02:56:36,240
are more likely to be open and trust you

3551
02:56:36,240 --> 02:56:38,760
uh non-verbal um if anybody here has

3552
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:39,600
gone through any type of interview

3553
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:40,979
resume training you've probably heard

3554
02:56:40,979 --> 02:56:42,899
the value of a strong handshake uh

3555
02:56:42,899 --> 02:56:45,899
genuine Smiles uh versus like creepy

3556
02:56:45,899 --> 02:56:47,819
Smiles if you try to go into like a

3557
02:56:47,819 --> 02:56:49,380
social engineering pretent and you're

3558
02:56:49,380 --> 02:56:51,720
giving like or like a really weird smile

3559
02:56:51,720 --> 02:56:52,979
you're gonna come off as creepy if you

3560
02:56:52,979 --> 02:56:54,600
can't do a genuine smile on command just

3561
02:56:54,600 --> 02:56:56,359
don't try it know what works for you

3562
02:56:56,359 --> 02:56:58,560
maintaining eye contact if you make eye

3563
02:56:58,560 --> 02:57:00,960
contact with someone it shows that you

3564
02:57:00,960 --> 02:57:03,060
are genuinely interested in what they're

3565
02:57:03,060 --> 02:57:04,740
saying you're engaged you're paying

3566
02:57:04,740 --> 02:57:07,319
attention you're paying attention and

3567
02:57:07,319 --> 02:57:09,240
then sometimes something as casually as

3568
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:10,979
leaning in when someone's speaking

3569
02:57:10,979 --> 02:57:14,040
you're naturally drawn to the things

3570
02:57:14,040 --> 02:57:15,720
that you're interested in and sometimes

3571
02:57:15,720 --> 02:57:18,240
that physical body movement portrays

3572
02:57:18,240 --> 02:57:20,880
these things that you may not think of

3573
02:57:20,880 --> 02:57:23,358
otherwise

3574
02:57:23,880 --> 02:57:25,080

3592
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:59,100
them what you loved about their work and

3593
02:57:59,100 --> 02:58:02,880
what they did and another big thing that

3594
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:04,560
really stands out for me personally is

3595
02:58:04,560 --> 02:58:07,380
owning your mistakes and apologizing

3596
02:58:07,380 --> 02:58:10,260
I've had guidance in the past from other

3597
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:13,020
mentors about never apologize for doing

3598
02:58:13,020 --> 02:58:15,420
anything never say you're sorry own it

3599
02:58:15,420 --> 02:58:17,040
and just you know what you did what you

3600
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:19,260
did you made that decision for some

3601
02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:21,600
reason and that particular scenario so

3602
02:58:21,600 --> 02:58:23,160
just roll with it don't apologize for

3603
02:58:23,160 --> 02:58:25,859
your actions and I have through my own

3604
02:58:25,859 --> 02:58:29,819
experience I disagree I'm a full

3605
02:58:29,819 --> 02:58:33,260
proponent of being candid and

3606
02:58:33,260 --> 02:58:35,880
recognizing situations internally where

3607
02:58:35,880 --> 02:58:37,620
maybe you could have done better and for

3608
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:39,359
other people when they hear you say hey

3609
02:58:39,359 --> 02:58:41,160
yeah I'm really sorry about that I made

3610
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:44,700
a mistake don't lead with excuses or

3611
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:47,220
this was my intention start with an

3612
02:58:47,220 --> 02:58:50,040
apology then explain some of those

3613
02:58:50,040 --> 02:58:51,420
qualifying statements that other people

3614
02:58:51,420 --> 02:58:54,080
might need to understand how

3615
02:58:54,080 --> 02:58:56,460
you understand your actions and how you

3616
02:58:56,460 --> 02:58:58,020
care these are all things that will play

3617
02:58:58,020 --> 02:59:00,540
and a lot of these tactics and scenarios

3618
02:59:00,540 --> 02:59:03,540
are generally short-term tactics focused

3619
02:59:03,540 --> 02:59:05,160
on you know social engineering how can

3620
02:59:05,160 --> 02:59:07,380
you make that first impression if the

3621
02:59:07,380 --> 02:59:09,600
receptionist trusts me will she let me

3622
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:12,240
bypass and then am I in the building am

3623
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:14,460
I free reign am I unescorted what are

3624
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:16,080
those visitor control policies that I

3625
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:17,819
may be able to get them to not follow

3626
02:59:17,819 --> 02:59:19,979
because they trust me

3627
02:59:19,979 --> 02:59:20,640
um

3628
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:23,340
so think about those things for

3629
02:59:23,340 --> 02:59:25,680
cognitive trust or how to manipulate

3630
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:27,359
cognitive trust

3631
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:28,500
um

3632
02:59:28,500 --> 02:59:31,920
being yourself verbally that really just

3633
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:34,080
means being open about all your

3634
02:59:34,080 --> 02:59:35,340
capabilities

3635
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:37,979
everyone hates the interview question

3636
02:59:37,979 --> 02:59:40,520
what's your greatest weakness

3637
02:59:40,520 --> 02:59:43,160
likewise everyone on the interview panel

3638
02:59:43,160 --> 02:59:46,260
hates hearing my weakness is also my

3639
02:59:46,260 --> 02:59:49,080
greatest strength I'm a perfectionist

3640
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:51,300
we all have real strengths and

3641
02:59:51,300 --> 02:59:53,100
weaknesses do that little bit of

3642
02:59:53,100 --> 02:59:54,479
introspective research and think about

3643
02:59:54,479 --> 02:59:57,420
what are yours but being open and honest

3644
02:59:57,420 --> 02:59:58,920
or candid about your own capabilities

3645
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:01,380
you can begin to set expectations of

3646
03:00:01,380 --> 03:00:03,779
consistency I'm capable and I'm

3647
03:00:03,779 --> 03:00:05,580
consistent that's how you get to

3648
03:00:05,580 --> 03:00:08,040
cognitive trust you know your teams

3649
03:00:08,040 --> 03:00:10,439
begin to understand how everyone comes

3650
03:00:10,439 --> 03:00:12,840
together one of the presenters earlier

3651
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:14,279
was talking about different specialized

3652
03:00:14,279 --> 03:00:16,560
roles in security and how can we know

3653
03:00:16,560 --> 03:00:18,420
everything everyone has to have a

3654
03:00:18,420 --> 03:00:20,819
specialization and if I know you know

3655
03:00:20,819 --> 03:00:22,439
I've got five people on my team and if I

3656
03:00:22,439 --> 03:00:23,819
know each of their strengths we all know

3657
03:00:23,819 --> 03:00:25,560
how we can come together and compensate

3658
03:00:25,560 --> 03:00:27,060
for each other's weaknesses and make

3659
03:00:27,060 --> 03:00:29,520
each other better in the long run it

3660
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:31,560
becomes a more productive and caring

3661
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:35,279
conversation when you discuss shortfalls

3662
03:00:35,279 --> 03:00:37,620
at performance reviews maybe you're a

3663
03:00:37,620 --> 03:00:39,359
manager and you need to talk have those

3664
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:41,359
hard conversations with your staff about

3665
03:00:41,359 --> 03:00:43,380
where they're failing in their

3666
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:45,859
performance where they need to do better

3667
03:00:45,859 --> 03:00:48,960
and if you have this type of Converse

3668
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:51,540
station and you be cognizant of your

3669
03:00:51,540 --> 03:00:53,580
tone of voice how you're inflicting

3670
03:00:53,580 --> 03:00:55,620
certain words or syllables it's going to

3671
03:00:55,620 --> 03:00:57,240
come across on how the recipient hears

3672
03:00:57,240 --> 03:00:58,500
your message

3673
03:00:58,500 --> 03:00:59,100
um

3674
03:00:59,100 --> 03:01:04,200
you know at work I've had an issue where

3675
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:06,479
I'm very hopeful but I'm internally very

3676
03:01:06,479 --> 03:01:07,859
pessimistic

3677
03:01:07,859 --> 03:01:09,420
and when I talk about the need to fix

3678
03:01:09,420 --> 03:01:11,520
problems it comes across very

3679
03:01:11,520 --> 03:01:13,560
pessimistic that puts everyone else in a

3680
03:01:13,560 --> 03:01:15,720
pessimistic mindset coming to a meeting

3681
03:01:15,720 --> 03:01:17,520
and think about hey yeah we've got this

3682
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:19,140
problem we have a security thing we need

3683
03:01:19,140 --> 03:01:21,720
to fix but how can we be optimistic

3684
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:23,160
about it

3685
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:26,160
hey if we do this it's only going to

3686
03:01:26,160 --> 03:01:27,479
take this amount of time this amount of

3687
03:01:27,479 --> 03:01:28,800
money whatever we need to do but we're

3688
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:31,140
going to fix this problem be excited

3689
03:01:31,140 --> 03:01:32,460
because ultimately in the background of

3690
03:01:32,460 --> 03:01:34,080
your mind you're excited about fixing

3691
03:01:34,080 --> 03:01:35,819
the problem not that you have a problem

3692
03:01:35,819 --> 03:01:37,200
to solve

3693
03:01:37,200 --> 03:01:39,359
um so adjust your mindset and your

3694
03:01:39,359 --> 03:01:41,160
perspective and let your voice carry

3695
03:01:41,160 --> 03:01:43,140
over into

3696
03:01:43,140 --> 03:01:44,760
um you know focusing on being happy

3697
03:01:44,760 --> 03:01:46,800
about the solution and your recipients

3698
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:49,580
are going to hear that too

3699
03:01:49,740 --> 03:01:51,960
non-verbal some of these are the same as

3700
03:01:51,960 --> 03:01:54,200
effective Trust again icon contact

3701
03:01:54,200 --> 03:01:57,060
dressing for the part

3702
03:01:57,060 --> 03:01:58,979
um like today I really wanted to dress

3703
03:01:58,979 --> 03:02:00,720
up Ultra Femme because I love how it

3704
03:02:00,720 --> 03:02:02,279
shocks especially a male-dominated

3705
03:02:02,279 --> 03:02:05,640
industry but practically it's cold

3706
03:02:05,640 --> 03:02:07,920
outside and yes thank you thermal shirt

3707
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:09,779
but you know if I'm going to go to the

3708
03:02:09,779 --> 03:02:11,640
state capitol I'm going to be in formal

3709
03:02:11,640 --> 03:02:13,260
business attire I'm not going to show up

3710
03:02:13,260 --> 03:02:15,300
in you know jeans and a jacket and

3711
03:02:15,300 --> 03:02:17,040
cowboy boots which in Oklahoma cowboy

3712
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,140
boots are acceptable formal attire I

3713
03:02:19,140 --> 03:02:20,460
don't know about Dakota but in Oklahoma

3714
03:02:20,460 --> 03:02:24,779
they are good posture and it reflects

3715
03:02:24,779 --> 03:02:27,540
confidence it really does

3716
03:02:27,540 --> 03:02:29,340
um and you know something as simple as

3717
03:02:29,340 --> 03:02:30,899
adjusting from standing like with your

3718
03:02:30,899 --> 03:02:32,819
feet really close together or going out

3719
03:02:32,819 --> 03:02:34,500
a little further and it's kind of called

3720
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:36,000
like a superhero pose where you're

3721
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:37,200
standing with your feet kind of shoulder

3722
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:38,939
width apart you got your shoulders back

3723
03:02:38,939 --> 03:02:41,939
it conveys confidence your facial

3724
03:02:41,939 --> 03:02:44,880
expressions you know are I I love

3725
03:02:44,880 --> 03:02:46,800
playing poker but I do not have a good

3726
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:47,960
poker face

3727
03:02:47,960 --> 03:02:50,340
so think about those things as you're

3728
03:02:50,340 --> 03:02:52,920
talking to people and you know carry

3729
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:54,899
that dress for success mentality I

3730
03:02:54,899 --> 03:02:56,220
absolutely hate it but with your

3731
03:02:56,220 --> 03:02:59,340
audience it does make a huge impact

3732
03:02:59,340 --> 03:03:01,319
um you know I walked into Silicon Valley

3733
03:03:01,319 --> 03:03:03,540
in a suit you'd be laughed at you'd

3734
03:03:03,540 --> 03:03:05,040
never be taken seriously but you walk in

3735
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:06,479
in a black hoodie and a pair of jeans

3736
03:03:06,479 --> 03:03:09,120
and some Converse then hey you're one of

3737
03:03:09,120 --> 03:03:10,680
us

3738
03:03:10,680 --> 03:03:13,140
um so it was kind of funny um

3739
03:03:13,140 --> 03:03:15,420
we went to Defcon and my husband decided

3740
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:17,040
to tag along with me he's a history

3741
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:19,200
major he is not Tech he's a wonderful

3742
03:03:19,200 --> 03:03:21,479
person he's great to talk to

3743
03:03:21,479 --> 03:03:23,340
um but he tagged along to an after party

3744
03:03:23,340 --> 03:03:25,500
and we were told to dress up so we did

3745
03:03:25,500 --> 03:03:26,880
and the only thing he brought with him

3746
03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:29,220
was like a really really nice suit

3747
03:03:29,220 --> 03:03:31,560
like over a thousand dollar suit it was

3748
03:03:31,560 --> 03:03:33,540
is super nice so we're at these After

3749
03:03:33,540 --> 03:03:35,399
parties and we're talking Tech and he's

3750
03:03:35,399 --> 03:03:36,960
like just drinking margaritas having

3751
03:03:36,960 --> 03:03:39,359
snacks and people kept coming up to talk

3752
03:03:39,359 --> 03:03:40,560
to him

3753
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:43,260
because he was dressed in a suit at a

3754
03:03:43,260 --> 03:03:44,700

love in Vegas uh so your appearance does

3762
03:04:00,180 --> 03:04:02,580
have an effect on people

3763
03:04:02,580 --> 03:04:04,260
um you know this little Tech wizard is

3764
03:04:04,260 --> 03:04:05,939
just sitting in the corner snacking on

3765
03:04:05,939 --> 03:04:07,380
some cheese and having a private

3766
03:04:07,380 --> 03:04:08,880
conversation

3767
03:04:08,880 --> 03:04:10,260
um another thing with dressing for the

3768
03:04:10,260 --> 03:04:14,100
part Goodwill is a treasure Trove for

3769
03:04:14,100 --> 03:04:16,200
social operators you go into Goodwill

3770
03:04:16,200 --> 03:04:19,439
you're gonna find an old Polo with a UPS

3771
03:04:19,439 --> 03:04:23,040
logo or a FedEx logo walk into a shop

3772
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:25,380
put on those little brown khaki shorts

3773
03:04:25,380 --> 03:04:27,899
and a belt and have on a UPS shirt pack

3774
03:04:27,899 --> 03:04:30,600
an empty box and a clipboard

3775
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:32,819
nine times out of ten you're gonna get

3776
03:04:32,819 --> 03:04:34,319
past the receptionist because they're

3777
03:04:34,319 --> 03:04:35,760
used to seeing delivery people coming

3778
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:37,560
and going and you're gonna have free

3779
03:04:37,560 --> 03:04:39,540
reign of that building

3780
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:42,660
and I mean you can do that with so many

3781
03:04:42,660 --> 03:04:44,060
different things

3782
03:04:44,060 --> 03:04:47,460
for establishing long-term Trust

3783
03:04:47,460 --> 03:04:49,800
the best advice I can give you with

3784
03:04:49,800 --> 03:04:52,680
cognitive trust is maintain your

3785
03:04:52,680 --> 03:04:53,819
integrity

3786
03:04:53,819 --> 03:04:56,700
think about consistency follow up with

3787
03:04:56,700 --> 03:04:59,160
people do what you said you would even

3788
03:04:59,160 --> 03:05:00,960
if it's insignificant maybe you casually

3789
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:02,819
tell someone in the hall like I used to

3790
03:05:02,819 --> 03:05:04,319
have issues with my technicians all the

3791
03:05:04,319 --> 03:05:05,880
time they would be out on a call fixing

3792
03:05:05,880 --> 03:05:07,680
a problem and somebody would want to

3793
03:05:07,680 --> 03:05:09,960
stop them and hey can you fix my issue

3794
03:05:09,960 --> 03:05:11,340
right now well you really need to submit

3795
03:05:11,340 --> 03:05:13,380
a ticket and you tell them hey you know

3796
03:05:13,380 --> 03:05:15,300
I can't come see you right now I've got

3797
03:05:15,300 --> 03:05:16,979
something I've got to do but I'll email

3798
03:05:16,979 --> 03:05:18,960
you before the end of the day before you

3799
03:05:18,960 --> 03:05:20,819
know it the day gets away from you you

3800
03:05:20,819 --> 03:05:23,340
haven't sent that email yet you need

3801
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:24,779
time to sit down and write that

3802
03:05:24,779 --> 03:05:26,880
meaningful thought out email that's okay

3803
03:05:26,880 --> 03:05:28,620
don't do that but send them a quick note

3804
03:05:28,620 --> 03:05:30,540
and say hey I'm sorry I told you I'd get

3805
03:05:30,540 --> 03:05:32,040
back to you by end of day things got

3806
03:05:32,040 --> 03:05:33,660
away from me I'll follow up with you

3807
03:05:33,660 --> 03:05:35,060
first thing tomorrow

3808
03:05:35,060 --> 03:05:38,100
maintain your integrity in every single

3809
03:05:38,100 --> 03:05:40,080
thing that you do

3810
03:05:40,080 --> 03:05:42,359
and that's really going to be the core

3811
03:05:42,359 --> 03:05:44,880
of being consistent

3812
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:48,479
um I'm perpetually late fashionably late

3813
03:05:48,479 --> 03:05:51,180
I might say but beyond time if

3814
03:05:51,180 --> 03:05:52,560
something's really important especially

3815
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:53,880
if you're working with a client or a

3816
03:05:53,880 --> 03:05:55,560
customer show up five minutes early or

3817
03:05:55,560 --> 03:05:57,420
at least be punctual that shows that you

3818
03:05:57,420 --> 03:05:59,279
not only respect your time you respect

3819
03:05:59,279 --> 03:06:02,220
their time if you see that you're on a

3820
03:06:02,220 --> 03:06:03,359
meeting and it was scheduled for 30

3821
03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:06,000
minutes and it's going long hey we got a

3822
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,560
couple minutes in our meeting I want to

3823
03:06:07,560 --> 03:06:10,140
be respectful of everyone's time or did

3824
03:06:10,140 --> 03:06:11,880
people need to leave or do can you or is

3825
03:06:11,880 --> 03:06:13,920
it okay to stay on a little late

3826
03:06:13,920 --> 03:06:16,020
those are the types of things those

3827
03:06:16,020 --> 03:06:17,880
little things

3828
03:06:17,880 --> 03:06:19,319
um you know maybe going back to the

3829
03:06:19,319 --> 03:06:21,479
example where you made a mistake can you

3830
03:06:21,479 --> 03:06:24,779
candidly address your inconsistency

3831
03:06:24,779 --> 03:06:27,479
hey I normally 99 of the time I'm going

3832
03:06:27,479 --> 03:06:30,120
to be spot on every change every patch

3833
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:31,680
that I push out is not going to break

3834
03:06:31,680 --> 03:06:33,300
things but then you push a passion oh my

3835
03:06:33,300 --> 03:06:35,640
gosh we gotta road to our rollback plan

3836
03:06:35,640 --> 03:06:37,439
can you own up to that mistake in your

3837
03:06:37,439 --> 03:06:40,040
environment Express what you did

3838
03:06:40,040 --> 03:06:42,660
Apologize showing that not only that you

3839
03:06:42,660 --> 03:06:44,160
care but you're addressing your

3840
03:06:44,160 --> 03:06:46,020
inconsistency which bleeds over into

3841
03:06:46,020 --> 03:06:48,060
your cognitive trust and then you take a

3842
03:06:48,060 --> 03:06:50,279
step further and you communicate what

3843
03:06:50,279 --> 03:06:51,660
are your plans to make sure that this

3844
03:06:51,660 --> 03:06:52,979
doesn't happen again and how we're going

3845
03:06:52,979 --> 03:06:53,960
to address it moving forward

3846
03:06:53,960 --> 03:06:56,100
re-establish your integrity as soon as

3847
03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:57,420
you lose it if you do lose it

3848
03:06:57,420 --> 03:06:59,660
re-establish it immediately

3849
03:06:59,660 --> 03:07:02,279
so some of these things have a more

3850
03:07:02,279 --> 03:07:05,460
Lasting Impression than others because

3851
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:08,120
it carries over to both types of trust

3852
03:07:08,120 --> 03:07:10,460
but you know when you think about

3853
03:07:10,460 --> 03:07:13,200
reverse engineering what other people

3854
03:07:13,200 --> 03:07:16,020
need it's essentially empathy it's

3855
03:07:16,020 --> 03:07:17,819
putting yourself in someone else's shoes

3856
03:07:17,819 --> 03:07:20,460
but also taking it a little bit deeper

3857
03:07:20,460 --> 03:07:22,500
you know for the example about you know

3858
03:07:22,500 --> 03:07:25,080
sending the end of day email

3859
03:07:25,080 --> 03:07:27,720
if I didn't send someone an email that I

3860
03:07:27,720 --> 03:07:28,979
told them hey I'm going to email you by

3861
03:07:28,979 --> 03:07:31,020
end of day then I don't do it what are

3862
03:07:31,020 --> 03:07:32,100
they thinking

3863
03:07:32,100 --> 03:07:34,920
she doesn't respect me I'm not worth her

3864
03:07:34,920 --> 03:07:35,880
time

3865
03:07:35,880 --> 03:07:38,100
does she really value me or care about

3866
03:07:38,100 --> 03:07:39,840
me and how does that affect their

3867
03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:41,640
perception of me what if it was a CFO

3868
03:07:41,640 --> 03:07:43,680
and eventually I've got to go sscfo for

3869
03:07:43,680 --> 03:07:44,880
a budget is that going to affect my

3870
03:07:44,880 --> 03:07:47,160
budget allocations later on so you know

3871
03:07:47,160 --> 03:07:48,660
if your security projects are always

3872
03:07:48,660 --> 03:07:51,960
getting denied go back and analyze how

3873
03:07:51,960 --> 03:07:54,240
did you present your idea how did you

3874
03:07:54,240 --> 03:07:56,580
talk about this you know how can you

3875
03:07:56,580 --> 03:07:58,979
request or you know adjust your project

3876
03:07:58,979 --> 03:08:02,700
to instead of highlighting how it fills

3877
03:08:02,700 --> 03:08:05,840
the needs of you and your security team

3878
03:08:05,840 --> 03:08:08,279
how does it actually fulfill the needs

3879
03:08:08,279 --> 03:08:09,779
of the company

3880
03:08:09,779 --> 03:08:11,700
maybe I'm going to talk to the CFO first

3881
03:08:11,700 --> 03:08:13,380
before I talk to the CEO let's tell the

3882
03:08:13,380 --> 03:08:15,420
CFO hey if we fix the security impact it

3883
03:08:15,420 --> 03:08:17,220
reduces the likelihood of this exploit

3884
03:08:17,220 --> 03:08:19,380
which has this cost for data breach

3885
03:08:19,380 --> 03:08:21,120
here's the calculations on cost of

3886
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:23,160
reputation and our business how can we

3887
03:08:23,160 --> 03:08:24,899
change that so ultimately we're

3888
03:08:24,899 --> 03:08:26,460
fulfilling our own goals but we're

3889
03:08:26,460 --> 03:08:28,500
manipulating someone else in a good or

3890
03:08:28,500 --> 03:08:30,420
bad way are we really manipulating them

3891
03:08:30,420 --> 03:08:33,240
or are we tailoring our message for the

3892
03:08:33,240 --> 03:08:35,700
audience it's kind of a fine line there

3893
03:08:35,700 --> 03:08:37,680
again white hat black hat you can use

3894
03:08:37,680 --> 03:08:39,779
this tons of different ways

3895
03:08:39,779 --> 03:08:41,880
um you know maybe you really understand

3896
03:08:41,880 --> 03:08:43,859
why vulnerability management is

3897
03:08:43,859 --> 03:08:45,600
important and it's a foundation of risk

3898
03:08:45,600 --> 03:08:47,100
management and a good security program

3899
03:08:47,100 --> 03:08:50,580
but leadership Tunes out every time you

3900
03:08:50,580 --> 03:08:54,420
talk Tech make it personal for them make

3901
03:08:54,420 --> 03:08:57,240
them Care by outlining

3902
03:08:57,240 --> 03:09:00,000
um how your goals also further theirs

3903
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:01,800
how are our goals in alignment the

3904
03:09:01,800 --> 03:09:03,779
things I want to do is eventually going

3905
03:09:03,779 --> 03:09:05,640
to help you get somewhere else where you

3906
03:09:05,640 --> 03:09:07,260
want to be as lame as it sounds

3907
03:09:07,260 --> 03:09:09,120
sometimes look at your company's mission

3908
03:09:09,120 --> 03:09:11,279
statements if they've set strategic

3909
03:09:11,279 --> 03:09:13,560
goals for the organization shift your

3910
03:09:13,560 --> 03:09:15,359
presentation so you're aligning to the

3911
03:09:15,359 --> 03:09:19,880
organization's needs not your needs

3912
03:09:21,420 --> 03:09:22,800
um and we kind of went through this

3913
03:09:22,800 --> 03:09:25,020
really quickly but yay for helping

3914
03:09:25,020 --> 03:09:26,220
Dakota client get a little bit back on

3915
03:09:26,220 --> 03:09:27,540
track one of the things that I want to

3916
03:09:27,540 --> 03:09:28,920
leave you guys with is Maslow's

3917
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:31,740
hierarchy of needs so if we go back and

3918
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:34,260
think about why bother with trust

3919
03:09:34,260 --> 03:09:36,899
the answer is it Fields a need it's

3920
03:09:36,899 --> 03:09:38,460
human conditioning to connect with other

3921
03:09:38,460 --> 03:09:40,319
individuals and using these different

3922
03:09:40,319 --> 03:09:43,920
tactics and others to establish trust is

3923
03:09:43,920 --> 03:09:45,120
kind of like learning to ride a bike

3924
03:09:45,120 --> 03:09:47,160
you're not going to be good at it when

3925
03:09:47,160 --> 03:09:48,779
you first start out you're going to fall

3926
03:09:48,779 --> 03:09:52,140
a lot you're gonna get back on and then

3927
03:09:52,140 --> 03:09:53,460
your shoelaces are going to get caught

3928
03:09:53,460 --> 03:09:54,840
in your pedals and you're going to learn

3929
03:09:54,840 --> 03:09:56,040
hey I need to make sure my shoes are

3930
03:09:56,040 --> 03:09:57,899
tied before I go ride my bike you're

3931
03:09:57,899 --> 03:09:59,340
going to build these things in your

3932
03:09:59,340 --> 03:10:01,800
security environment you're going to

3933
03:10:01,800 --> 03:10:03,420
figure out you know weight distribution

3934
03:10:03,420 --> 03:10:05,100
and how you should do things how can you

3935
03:10:05,100 --> 03:10:06,300
pop a wheelie you're going to figure out

3936
03:10:06,300 --> 03:10:08,640
some specialized things

3937
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:11,700
um and then you're going to learn so

3938
03:10:11,700 --> 03:10:12,840
it's the same thing here with

3939
03:10:12,840 --> 03:10:14,760
establishing trust with people you might

3940
03:10:14,760 --> 03:10:16,620
suck at it at first but keep going with

3941
03:10:16,620 --> 03:10:18,000
it you're not going to be a great pen

3942
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:19,680
tester at first

3943
03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:22,319
start with can you crack a password on a

3944
03:10:22,319 --> 03:10:24,420
Microsoft Word document then take the

3945
03:10:24,420 --> 03:10:25,920
next step

3946
03:10:25,920 --> 03:10:28,560
um but you know maybe you're not always

3947
03:10:28,560 --> 03:10:29,939
the best at communicating your

3948
03:10:29,939 --> 03:10:31,859
capabilities but you can use some of

3949
03:10:31,859 --> 03:10:33,660
these tactics to make sure your

3950
03:10:33,660 --> 03:10:35,700
leadership knows and understands your

3951
03:10:35,700 --> 03:10:37,800
capabilities you know do you want to

3952
03:10:37,800 --> 03:10:39,479
request training if you can better

3953
03:10:39,479 --> 03:10:41,700
express your capabilities and your

3954
03:10:41,700 --> 03:10:43,380
progress that your teams have made could

3955
03:10:43,380 --> 03:10:45,359
you get a raise are you more likely to

3956
03:10:45,359 --> 03:10:47,819
get a promotion within the next year you

3957
03:10:47,819 --> 03:10:49,380
know if you start an internal security

3958
03:10:49,380 --> 03:10:51,140
awareness campaign

3959
03:10:51,140 --> 03:10:54,300
how do you help your end users to stop

3960
03:10:54,300 --> 03:10:56,880
thinking about you as the paranoid

3961
03:10:56,880 --> 03:10:58,340
security person

3962
03:10:58,340 --> 03:11:02,460
and seeing you as that trusted advisor

3963
03:11:02,460 --> 03:11:04,560
that really cares about them and the

3964
03:11:04,560 --> 03:11:05,760
company you know we're not just doing

3965
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:07,439
security for the sake of it we're doing

3966
03:11:07,439 --> 03:11:10,500
it for a goal and because we care you

3967
03:11:10,500 --> 03:11:12,359
know and if they begin to believe that

3968
03:11:12,359 --> 03:11:13,920
you care you've established that

3969
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:15,660
cognitive and effective trust with them

3970
03:11:15,660 --> 03:11:19,080
are they more likely to report things

3971
03:11:19,080 --> 03:11:22,380
they understand oh my gosh I misclicked

3972
03:11:22,380 --> 03:11:24,420
but they I need to report it and you

3973
03:11:24,420 --> 03:11:25,920
know the quicker you can respond to an

3974
03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:29,279
incident the more likely you are to have

3975
03:11:29,279 --> 03:11:32,399
a lower impact so if your staff care and

3976
03:11:32,399 --> 03:11:35,279
they understand that you care

3977
03:11:35,279 --> 03:11:36,899
they're going to be more open to

3978
03:11:36,899 --> 03:11:38,279
security they know that you're not just

3979
03:11:38,279 --> 03:11:40,080
doing things arbitrarily or it's not a

3980
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:42,660
Power Trip you're doing it for a reason

3981
03:11:42,660 --> 03:11:43,979
um you know and how would it change the

3982
03:11:43,979 --> 03:11:46,500
dynamic of your team if your team trusts

3983
03:11:46,500 --> 03:11:48,420
you and they trust each other are you

3984
03:11:48,420 --> 03:11:50,220
going to have greater Innovation are

3985
03:11:50,220 --> 03:11:51,660
they going to feel free to like hey I'm

3986
03:11:51,660 --> 03:11:54,060
going to you know propose an idea maybe

3987
03:11:54,060 --> 03:11:55,859
we can automate some things through

3988
03:11:55,859 --> 03:11:58,080
scripting and I almost said I had some

3989
03:11:58,080 --> 03:11:59,939
database devs that went through and did

3990
03:11:59,939 --> 03:12:01,939
a data diagram

3991
03:12:01,939 --> 03:12:06,960
flows and they found a spot where they

3992
03:12:06,960 --> 03:12:10,439
could save themselves 15 minutes a week

3993
03:12:10,439 --> 03:12:12,779
big deal 15 minutes a week

3994
03:12:12,779 --> 03:12:14,399
do the math

3995
03:12:14,399 --> 03:12:17,580
15 minutes a week over a month over a

3996
03:12:17,580 --> 03:12:18,840
year

3997
03:12:18,840 --> 03:12:20,819
that's money for somebody's promotion

3998
03:12:20,819 --> 03:12:23,100
that's money for somebody's raise to

3999
03:12:23,100 --> 03:12:25,020
keep them safe and happy in their work

4000
03:12:25,020 --> 03:12:26,700
environment

4001
03:12:26,700 --> 03:12:28,740
um so there's lots of different Dynamics

4002
03:12:28,740 --> 03:12:30,960
to trust

4003
03:12:30,960 --> 03:12:33,420
um and again I hope you guys have at

4004
03:12:33,420 --> 03:12:35,279
least learned one thing new whether it's

4005
03:12:35,279 --> 03:12:37,020
black hat white hat different ways that

4006
03:12:37,020 --> 03:12:39,420
you could do it in Social operations in

4007
03:12:39,420 --> 03:12:42,620
sales or even in an executive level

4008

03:28:45,420 --> 03:28:48,479
hat this past summer and has been

4039

working on a ton of different cool

4040
03:28:50,880 --> 03:28:53,880
security related projects he's done so

4041
03:28:53,880 --> 03:28:55,620
many things like research malware he

4042
03:28:55,620 --> 03:28:57,239
does so many things I don't even know

4043
03:28:57,239 --> 03:28:59,580
about so I'm excited for him to teach

4044
03:28:59,580 --> 03:29:01,680
you guys all about his new tool that he

4045
03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:04,700
developed so take it away

4046
03:29:07,859 --> 03:29:10,140
hey thank you thank you so much

4047
03:29:10,140 --> 03:29:11,880
um thanks everybody for showing up but

4048
03:29:11,880 --> 03:29:13,560
yeah so this is a tool that I've been

4049
03:29:13,560 --> 03:29:16,920
working on kind of off and on for a few

4050
03:29:16,920 --> 03:29:18,200
years now

4051
03:29:18,200 --> 03:29:20,640
kind of going at a slow with school and

4052
03:29:20,640 --> 03:29:22,739
work and everything like that but um

4053
03:29:22,739 --> 03:29:25,200
yeah the tool is called nightcap so

4054
03:29:25,200 --> 03:29:27,840
about me I'm from Wyoming my background

4055
03:29:27,840 --> 03:29:30,020
is in a mobile application development

4056
03:29:30,020 --> 03:29:33,660
and large-scale automation I'm going to

4057
03:29:33,660 --> 03:29:35,819
be graduating this semester with my

4058
03:29:35,819 --> 03:29:39,239
bachelor's in cyber operations as Annie

4059
03:29:39,239 --> 03:29:41,580
was saying I presented it black hat this

4060
03:29:41,580 --> 03:29:44,600
last summer I wrote a tool called

4061
03:29:44,600 --> 03:29:48,120
subparse does large-scale automation of

4062
03:29:48,120 --> 03:29:50,160
malware analysis which was really really

4063
03:29:50,160 --> 03:29:53,460
fun so malware research I do pen testing

4064
03:29:53,460 --> 03:29:57,060
and part of the CCD Club

4065
03:29:57,060 --> 03:29:59,399
so this tool is kind of a general

4066
03:29:59,399 --> 03:30:02,760
purpose red blue purple team utility

4067
03:30:02,760 --> 03:30:05,460
belt it allows for the automation of

4068
03:30:05,460 --> 03:30:08,520
installing as well as the setup in the

4069
03:30:08,520 --> 03:30:09,560
environment

4070
03:30:09,560 --> 03:30:12,660
for tools that have reporting and don't

4071
03:30:12,660 --> 03:30:15,140
have reporting it will automatically

4072
03:30:15,140 --> 03:30:19,800
allow them to now have reporting so kind

4073
03:30:19,800 --> 03:30:21,380
of kind of fun

4074
03:30:21,380 --> 03:30:24,899
shareable installation packages so say

4075
03:30:24,899 --> 03:30:26,700
you're working on a team or you have

4076
03:30:26,700 --> 03:30:29,939
different companies throughout

4077
03:30:29,939 --> 03:30:31,620
you know the states or whatever you can

4078
03:30:31,620 --> 03:30:34,319
basically give them the same Essence as

4079
03:30:34,319 --> 03:30:36,120
like an executable and install it into

4080
03:30:36,120 --> 03:30:37,680
the framework

4081
03:30:37,680 --> 03:30:38,819
um

4082
03:30:38,819 --> 03:30:41,160
the name so when I initially was

4083
03:30:41,160 --> 03:30:43,200
starting to build this I was at the ru

4084
03:30:43,200 --> 03:30:46,319
internship here at Dakota State and

4085
03:30:46,319 --> 03:30:48,899
built a tool called bust a pcap for

4086
03:30:48,899 --> 03:30:52,260
Network traffic and then The nightcap

4087
03:30:52,260 --> 03:30:54,239
always reminded me of like this is all

4088
03:30:54,239 --> 03:30:57,979
owl with the top

4089
03:30:58,380 --> 03:31:00,359
um some features of the tool it allows

4090
03:31:00,359 --> 03:31:02,580
for backup and restoration of your whole

4091
03:31:02,580 --> 03:31:04,979
environment this way then if you're like

4092
03:31:04,979 --> 03:31:06,660
transferring to a different PC or if you

4093
03:31:06,660 --> 03:31:10,140
have a team of employees you can

4094
03:31:10,140 --> 03:31:14,040
basically copy it one for one across uh

4095
03:31:14,040 --> 03:31:17,640
each each platform it is platform

4096
03:31:17,640 --> 03:31:20,040
independent most of the back end is

4097
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:21,800
inside of Docker

4098
03:31:21,800 --> 03:31:25,040
which allows for the team

4099
03:31:25,040 --> 03:31:26,779
collaboration

4100
03:31:26,779 --> 03:31:30,840
Auto report generation it has a command

4101
03:31:30,840 --> 03:31:34,319
line and a website of it and yeah the

4102
03:31:34,319 --> 03:31:36,239
nice thing about the tool is it helps

4103
03:31:36,239 --> 03:31:38,700
remember all your arguments so you never

4104
03:31:38,700 --> 03:31:40,319
have to go look at you know the GitHub

4105
03:31:40,319 --> 03:31:42,420
or the Man pages again to to actually go

4106
03:31:42,420 --> 03:31:44,160
remember them you're able to set

4107
03:31:44,160 --> 03:31:45,960
defaults and stuff like that when you're

4108
03:31:45,960 --> 03:31:48,779
running the tools well

4109
03:31:48,779 --> 03:31:52,319
uh customer customizable you can do two

4110
03:31:52,319 --> 03:31:54,359
different forms of installation packages

4111
03:31:54,359 --> 03:31:56,359
so you can have remote

4112
03:31:56,359 --> 03:31:58,500
server that would actually be hosting

4113
03:31:58,500 --> 03:32:01,020
all of the code that would be then

4114
03:32:01,020 --> 03:32:03,960
installed onto the systems or you can

4115
03:32:03,960 --> 03:32:05,279
actually have like a full-blown

4116
03:32:05,279 --> 03:32:07,380
executable where all the code is

4117
03:32:07,380 --> 03:32:10,080
directly packaged inside pros and cons

4118
03:32:10,080 --> 03:32:13,560
to both you get more virgin control if

4119
03:32:13,560 --> 03:32:15,660
it if it's you know all inside of the

4120
03:32:15,660 --> 03:32:19,319
executable but a smaller package if it's

4121
03:32:19,319 --> 03:32:21,300
if it's remote

4122
03:32:21,300 --> 03:32:23,279
uh the reporting 10 points are all

4123
03:32:23,279 --> 03:32:26,239
customizable as well so you can

4124
03:32:26,239 --> 03:32:30,239
basically place the data

4125
03:32:30,239 --> 03:32:33,120
you know anywhere you want it to and all

4126
03:32:33,120 --> 03:32:34,500
the reports are going to be generated on

4127
03:32:34,500 --> 03:32:36,359
the website of it

4128
03:32:36,359 --> 03:32:39,000
um and there'll be exports at some point

4129
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:40,859
just haven't haven't quite got there on

4130
03:32:40,859 --> 03:32:42,720
that

4131
03:32:42,720 --> 03:32:43,800
all right

4132
03:32:43,800 --> 03:32:45,840
so different use cases

4133
03:32:45,840 --> 03:32:47,640
um honestly the the sky's kind of the

4134
03:32:47,640 --> 03:32:49,979
limit I know that everybody has their

4135
03:32:49,979 --> 03:32:51,479
own tool sets that they run all the time

4136
03:32:51,479 --> 03:32:53,840
different languages

4137
03:32:53,840 --> 03:32:56,160
and it's kind of nice to be able to have

4138
03:32:56,160 --> 03:32:58,140
everything clustered in one spot so you

4139
03:32:58,140 --> 03:32:59,760
can customize this tool belt to your

4140
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:01,939
specific needs whether it be pen testing

4141
03:33:01,939 --> 03:33:04,920
you know blue teamwork if you do

4142
03:33:04,920 --> 03:33:08,220
research or forensics type stuff I know

4143
03:33:08,220 --> 03:33:12,120
for a little while I had a tool that was

4144
03:33:12,120 --> 03:33:13,620
installed in here that would just unpack

4145
03:33:13,620 --> 03:33:16,080
different binaries for me instead I have

4146
03:33:16,080 --> 03:33:17,520
to do the manual process every single

4147
03:33:17,520 --> 03:33:21,660
time just pass it to file and it was off

4148
03:33:21,660 --> 03:33:24,420
all right so do a little bit of a demo

4149
03:33:24,420 --> 03:33:26,580
we'll see how it goes

4150
03:33:26,580 --> 03:33:29,180
um yeah

4151
03:33:47,220 --> 03:33:49,880
pretty small

4152
03:33:54,720 --> 03:33:57,120
is that better for you guys

4153
03:33:57,120 --> 03:33:58,859
good good okay

4154
03:33:58,859 --> 03:34:01,580
all right so

4155
03:34:04,319 --> 03:34:06,180
get some of this other back end stuff's

4156
03:34:06,180 --> 03:34:09,020
pulled up real fast

4157
03:34:10,620 --> 03:34:14,460
all right so it is a python package

4158
03:34:14,460 --> 03:34:15,960
um right now we're just going to be

4159
03:34:15,960 --> 03:34:17,880
running on the Local Host I don't want

4160
03:34:17,880 --> 03:34:19,979
to be running a Docker on my system

4161
03:34:19,979 --> 03:34:22,020
right now but it does allow for the

4162
03:34:22,020 --> 03:34:24,120
installation uh inside of Docker or on

4163
03:34:24,120 --> 03:34:26,520
localhost if you are doing an inside

4164
03:34:26,520 --> 03:34:28,620
Docker it will set up the environment to

4165
03:34:28,620 --> 03:34:30,540
allow for multi-language support right

4166
03:34:30,540 --> 03:34:33,420
out of the box so right now you can

4167
03:34:33,420 --> 03:34:35,040
support every single version of python

4168
03:34:35,040 --> 03:34:37,859
and golang and and that automatically

4169
03:34:37,859 --> 03:34:40,200
gets installed I am going to be allowing

4170
03:34:40,200 --> 03:34:42,660
it to support rust and Ruby as well and

4171
03:34:42,660 --> 03:34:44,580
then try and do like playing Powershell

4172
03:34:44,580 --> 03:34:48,060
some different Oddball stuff

4173
03:34:48,060 --> 03:34:49,319
so

4174
03:34:49,319 --> 03:34:51,380
um

4175
03:34:53,700 --> 03:34:55,920
so we get this

4176
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:57,840
a little welcome page

4177
03:34:57,840 --> 03:35:00,239
um this I know it says Docker instance I

4178
03:35:00,239 --> 03:35:02,220
modified the config a little to to make

4179
03:35:02,220 --> 03:35:04,380
it work for this but uh um this is going

4180
03:35:04,380 --> 03:35:07,920
to be reaching out to my actual server

4181
03:35:07,920 --> 03:35:10,500
um it is using the docker Daemon

4182
03:35:10,500 --> 03:35:13,020
um which if you guys do much with Docker

4183
03:35:13,020 --> 03:35:14,880
you can not run on your system but be

4184
03:35:14,880 --> 03:35:16,439
able to connect to the docker Daemon on

4185
03:35:16,439 --> 03:35:17,700
your system to have a go to a remote

4186
03:35:17,700 --> 03:35:18,620
host

4187
03:35:18,620 --> 03:35:23,279
so it does have a instance there I

4188
03:35:23,279 --> 03:35:26,399
do use a Ubuntu container that's what uh

4189
03:35:26,399 --> 03:35:28,020
if you didn't want it on your localhost

4190
03:35:28,020 --> 03:35:30,600
that you'd be using so just go ahead and

4191
03:35:30,600 --> 03:35:32,779
connect

4192
03:35:33,260 --> 03:35:35,580
arbitrary banner and stuff like that you

4193
03:35:35,580 --> 03:35:36,720
know gotta gotta make it look like

4194
03:35:36,720 --> 03:35:39,438
Metasploit

4195
03:35:39,779 --> 03:35:41,520
and that's kind of a little bit of what

4196
03:35:41,520 --> 03:35:44,220
I modeled this tool off of was the way

4197
03:35:44,220 --> 03:35:45,960
the Metasploit does stuff then again

4198
03:35:45,960 --> 03:35:48,479
it's Ruby python you know there's that

4199
03:35:48,479 --> 03:35:49,500
fight

4200
03:35:49,500 --> 03:35:53,399
um right off the bat has help menu we

4201
03:35:53,399 --> 03:35:55,260
don't have anything

4202
03:35:55,260 --> 03:35:57,300
currently installed so we have no

4203
03:35:57,300 --> 03:35:59,160
modules so we should probably just go do

4204
03:35:59,160 --> 03:36:02,420
that so go into settings

4205
03:36:04,319 --> 03:36:06,060
um there's different database options

4206
03:36:06,060 --> 03:36:08,580
right so if you were to

4207
03:36:08,580 --> 03:36:12,300
um be working for like company X as a

4208
03:36:12,300 --> 03:36:14,580
like consultant and you're gonna go to a

4209
03:36:14,580 --> 03:36:16,620
company Y and they had this this program

4210
03:36:16,620 --> 03:36:18,359
you just have to go in and change the

4211
03:36:18,359 --> 03:36:19,340
database

4212
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:23,340
and you'll be able to pull the installs

4213
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:25,680
from from the remote stuff and be able

4214
03:36:25,680 --> 03:36:28,200
to instantly have a set set back up for

4215
03:36:28,200 --> 03:36:29,840
the other company

4216
03:36:29,840 --> 03:36:31,979
basically to make it as modular as

4217
03:36:31,979 --> 03:36:33,720
possible

4218
03:36:33,720 --> 03:36:35,939
um I know with a lot of tools I've wrote

4219
03:36:35,939 --> 03:36:39,239
modular modularity was a huge deal so

4220
03:36:39,239 --> 03:36:42,979
with this tried to do the same

4221
03:36:44,220 --> 03:36:46,760
all right

4222
03:36:53,580 --> 03:36:56,700
so inside of here we can list the

4223
03:36:56,700 --> 03:36:59,460
installs uninstall and as well as update

4224
03:36:59,460 --> 03:37:02,180
I know that updating is a huge deal

4225
03:37:02,180 --> 03:37:04,560
especially with like custom tools right

4226
03:37:04,560 --> 03:37:06,840
I mean you got to go find that exact

4227
03:37:06,840 --> 03:37:09,359
folder you got to then repo from git or

4228
03:37:09,359 --> 03:37:11,640
go through their their custom way of

4229
03:37:11,640 --> 03:37:15,180
doing it so basically this is would be a

4230
03:37:15,180 --> 03:37:17,040
little wrapper to then go through all of

4231
03:37:17,040 --> 03:37:18,540
the tools that you have and then

4232
03:37:18,540 --> 03:37:20,580
automatically update them for you help

4233
03:37:20,580 --> 03:37:23,040
save save time and just kind of

4234
03:37:23,040 --> 03:37:25,319
streamlines everything

4235
03:37:25,319 --> 03:37:28,160
so

4236
03:37:31,859 --> 03:37:34,640
where's the filter

4237
03:37:43,200 --> 03:37:47,720
all right so we'll just install

4238
03:37:48,359 --> 03:37:51,140
real fast

4239
03:37:58,439 --> 03:38:00,779
sorry

4240
03:38:00,779 --> 03:38:03,739
I fingering stuff

4241
03:38:05,460 --> 03:38:07,319
so it's going to go ahead and just

4242
03:38:07,319 --> 03:38:09,060
install the package uh automatically

4243
03:38:09,060 --> 03:38:11,100
crease new environment installs

4244
03:38:11,100 --> 03:38:12,420
everything that's needed for that

4245
03:38:12,420 --> 03:38:16,020
environment this allows to or this helps

4246
03:38:16,020 --> 03:38:18,899
support version Independence so you can

4247
03:38:18,899 --> 03:38:20,580
have the exact same tool with

4248
03:38:20,580 --> 03:38:23,220
conflicting packages in the back end and

4249
03:38:23,220 --> 03:38:25,520
then it'll automatically run your tool

4250
03:38:25,520 --> 03:38:28,439
against that environment it does that

4251
03:38:28,439 --> 03:38:30,779
for all the python versions as well as

4252
03:38:30,779 --> 03:38:32,640
golang

4253
03:38:32,640 --> 03:38:36,239
which is kind of Handy you know with my

4254
03:38:36,239 --> 03:38:38,100
background side of Dev work it was

4255
03:38:38,100 --> 03:38:39,960
always a pain when you had conflicting

4256
03:38:39,960 --> 03:38:43,140
packages I mean it can cause all the

4257
03:38:43,140 --> 03:38:47,580
problems and a lot of wasted time

4258
03:38:47,580 --> 03:38:49,080
all right so if we go ahead and just

4259
03:38:49,080 --> 03:38:50,700
list this out

4260
03:38:50,700 --> 03:38:52,560
um it's able to show you know the author

4261
03:38:52,560 --> 03:38:56,220
you got the details and then the path

4262
03:38:56,220 --> 03:38:57,660
um just like metasployed is going to be

4263
03:38:57,660 --> 03:38:59,700
what you use to to go ahead and like

4264
03:38:59,700 --> 03:39:02,640
execute uh that specific one so we'll

4265
03:39:02,640 --> 03:39:05,599
just go ahead and exit

4266
03:39:07,319 --> 03:39:10,020
and does allow for tab completion and

4267
03:39:10,020 --> 03:39:11,819
then you can go as deep as you need to

4268
03:39:11,819 --> 03:39:15,000
and then it tries to do path correction

4269
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:16,920
as well

4270
03:39:16,920 --> 03:39:20,160
which can kind of come in handy

4271
03:39:20,160 --> 03:39:23,340
all right so with the options I just

4272
03:39:23,340 --> 03:39:25,640
like metisplay you know it has the

4273
03:39:25,640 --> 03:39:28,939
preset like variables

4274
03:39:28,939 --> 03:39:32,340
this this allows uh or this makes it

4275
03:39:32,340 --> 03:39:34,439
easier so you never forget what the

4276
03:39:34,439 --> 03:39:36,479
package actually needs to run

4277
03:39:36,479 --> 03:39:39,060
um it will air out if uh you know if

4278
03:39:39,060 --> 03:39:40,739
you're missing one it does have like the

4279
03:39:40,739 --> 03:39:43,680
required right there for the domain the

4280
03:39:43,680 --> 03:39:45,720
required you can have multiple versions

4281
03:39:45,720 --> 03:39:49,080
or multiple instances of it which

4282
03:39:49,080 --> 03:39:51,180
definitely helps for the end user if

4283
03:39:51,180 --> 03:39:52,680
it's a brand new package that you have

4284
03:39:52,680 --> 03:39:54,840
and they're not used to it to basically

4285
03:39:54,840 --> 03:39:57,420
you know enforce it

4286
03:39:57,420 --> 03:39:59,040
um so there's default and then there's

4287
03:39:59,040 --> 03:40:02,399
set for the two different options uh two

4288
03:40:02,399 --> 03:40:05,279
different ways that you can

4289
03:40:05,279 --> 03:40:08,420
basically set a variable on the package

4290
03:40:08,420 --> 03:40:11,700
default will allow it to set it inside

4291
03:40:11,700 --> 03:40:13,260
of the database so that when you exit

4292
03:40:13,260 --> 03:40:14,819
and come back to it that it'll still be

4293
03:40:14,819 --> 03:40:16,439
there set would be for like a one-off

4294
03:40:16,439 --> 03:40:18,060
instance where you just need to change

4295
03:40:18,060 --> 03:40:20,340
something say verbose City or something

4296
03:40:20,340 --> 03:40:22,439
on a tool and you don't want that to

4297
03:40:22,439 --> 03:40:24,479
continue on

4298
03:40:24,479 --> 03:40:26,640
so just say default

4299
03:40:26,640 --> 03:40:28,500
anybody have a domain that they want me

4300
03:40:28,500 --> 03:40:30,680
to use

4301
03:40:30,840 --> 03:40:34,040
now I'll do these Google

4302
03:40:36,779 --> 03:40:39,779
all right so let's go ahead and run it I

4303
03:40:39,779 --> 03:40:41,460
don't have a

4304
03:40:41,460 --> 03:40:44,880
a project setup so it won't pull any of

4305
03:40:44,880 --> 03:40:46,620
the reporting so we'll just go ahead and

4306
03:40:46,620 --> 03:40:48,660
say say no so it did cancel the

4307
03:40:48,660 --> 03:40:50,180
execution

4308
03:40:50,180 --> 03:40:53,580
so this is the project side we can say

4309
03:40:53,580 --> 03:40:54,779
projects

4310
03:40:54,779 --> 03:40:58,380
so you have select create and you know

4311
03:40:58,380 --> 03:41:01,859
destroy let's say create

4312
03:41:01,859 --> 03:41:04,640
let's see

4313
03:41:14,279 --> 03:41:16,680
um you can always check the config 2 at

4314
03:41:16,680 --> 03:41:18,180
pretty much any point inside of the tool

4315
03:41:18,180 --> 03:41:20,460
this will show you know the verbo City

4316
03:41:20,460 --> 03:41:22,800
whatever database you're connected to so

4317
03:41:22,800 --> 03:41:25,260
I have like three or four different

4318
03:41:25,260 --> 03:41:27,479
 instances that I'll roll back and

4319
03:41:27,479 --> 03:41:30,060
forth between two uh for these

4320
03:41:30,060 --> 03:41:31,979
um sometimes you can get a little

4321
03:41:31,979 --> 03:41:34,620
confusing the project side of it

4322
03:41:34,620 --> 03:41:36,600
um so say that you're doing like pen

4323
03:41:36,600 --> 03:41:37,680
testing or something like that it's

4324
03:41:37,680 --> 03:41:39,239
great to be able to break all the

4325
03:41:39,239 --> 03:41:42,000
reports Down based off of each client so

4326
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:44,819
kind of following that that whole

4327
03:41:44,819 --> 03:41:47,539
methodology

4328
03:41:48,000 --> 03:41:50,880
so just go ahead and run this tool

4329
03:41:50,880 --> 03:41:53,580
and

4330
03:41:53,580 --> 03:41:56,220
oh it should be good

4331
03:41:56,220 --> 03:41:59,399
so basically we're able to see the tool

4332
03:41:59,399 --> 03:42:02,640
actually running all of the uh

4333
03:42:02,640 --> 03:42:04,739
information itself is going to be

4334
03:42:04,739 --> 03:42:06,000
displayed on the screen but then we'll

4335
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:07,859
be able to capture basically a copy of

4336
03:42:07,859 --> 03:42:09,000
it

4337
03:42:09,000 --> 03:42:11,000
um

4338
03:42:11,700 --> 03:42:15,020
hopefully this also works

4339
03:42:19,739 --> 03:42:21,420
um here trying another tool real fast I

4340
03:42:21,420 --> 03:42:23,779
apologize

4341
03:42:28,439 --> 03:42:31,279
do

4342
03:42:40,080 --> 03:42:42,120
so the package name for this it does say

4343
03:42:42,120 --> 03:42:43,319
old

4344
03:42:43,319 --> 03:42:43,920
um

4345
03:42:43,920 --> 03:42:47,279
so inside of the config files which I

4346
03:42:47,279 --> 03:42:49,200
can show you guys a little bit later uh

4347
03:42:49,200 --> 03:42:52,560
you're able to specify a commit ID

4348
03:42:52,560 --> 03:42:54,840
um that way if you are part of a Dev

4349
03:42:54,840 --> 03:42:56,880
team or whatnot you can go to specific

4350
03:42:56,880 --> 03:43:00,479
instances like of those tools if you do

4351
03:43:00,479 --> 03:43:02,580
uh update

4352
03:43:02,580 --> 03:43:03,300
um

4353
03:43:03,300 --> 03:43:05,819
it will go to the newest version of that

4354
03:43:05,819 --> 03:43:08,119
tool

4355
03:43:09,779 --> 03:43:12,680
um just always

4356
03:43:13,080 --> 03:43:15,479
great so this is going to run it as you

4357
03:43:15,479 --> 03:43:17,520
see it's very quick I mean this is just

4358
03:43:17,520 --> 03:43:20,040
DNS information and then it does

4359
03:43:20,040 --> 03:43:22,319
automatically pull it before we go and

4360
03:43:22,319 --> 03:43:26,460
look at some of the uh web stuff

4361
03:43:26,460 --> 03:43:27,540
um

4362
03:43:27,540 --> 03:43:31,260
show you guys a few nice things as far

4363
03:43:31,260 --> 03:43:33,120
as like if you were to go to a different

4364
03:43:33,120 --> 03:43:34,620
environment being able to instantly go

4365
03:43:34,620 --> 03:43:36,660
get all of your tools back reinstalled

4366
03:43:36,660 --> 03:43:38,340
all the environments set up for you

4367
03:43:38,340 --> 03:43:40,979
without having to manually do it so

4368
03:43:40,979 --> 03:43:43,699
we'll just go into settings

4369
03:43:47,819 --> 03:43:51,060
so inside of the system there's a backup

4370
03:43:51,060 --> 03:43:53,420
option

4371
03:43:55,399 --> 03:43:58,680
so with the the backups so you can

4372
03:43:58,680 --> 03:44:01,439
backup and restore

4373
03:44:01,439 --> 03:44:04,560
I did have one earlier today that I was

4374
03:44:04,560 --> 03:44:07,620
going to use for the con but basically

4375
03:44:07,620 --> 03:44:09,720
you just say backup and then you'll just

4376
03:44:09,720 --> 03:44:11,520
pass it

4377
03:44:11,520 --> 03:44:13,260
the

4378
03:44:13,260 --> 03:44:15,960
system path that you want it to go and

4379
03:44:15,960 --> 03:44:19,500
there we go it backed up everything as

4380
03:44:19,500 --> 03:44:22,080
far as the installers and you get a

4381
03:44:22,080 --> 03:44:25,580
if you guys can see that

4382
03:44:27,180 --> 03:44:29,580
not really but um basically the file

4383
03:44:29,580 --> 03:44:31,620
extension that I have for that is NCB

4384
03:44:31,620 --> 03:44:33,960
which would be a nightcap backup then

4385
03:44:33,960 --> 03:44:36,300
this system actually will generate NCP

4386
03:44:36,300 --> 03:44:38,460
files which would be the package

4387
03:44:38,460 --> 03:44:41,358
installation files

4388
03:44:41,939 --> 03:44:47,640
team if we uh go here actions

4389
03:44:47,640 --> 03:44:50,520
um we'll just go ahead and

4390
03:44:50,520 --> 03:44:53,779
uninstall all these

4391
03:45:03,239 --> 03:45:07,620
so now what we can do is resort to the

4392
03:45:07,620 --> 03:45:10,520
previous state that we had

4393
03:45:13,020 --> 03:45:14,819
now we'll go ahead and go through each

4394
03:45:14,819 --> 03:45:17,340
one of the packages that we had and

4395
03:45:17,340 --> 03:45:19,380
reset up all the environments that we

4396
03:45:19,380 --> 03:45:20,819
don't have to

4397
03:45:20,819 --> 03:45:24,540
um I know that like with me I was going

4398
03:45:24,540 --> 03:45:25,680
back and forth between like different

4399
03:45:25,680 --> 03:45:27,720
Linux distributions all the time or

4400
03:45:27,720 --> 03:45:30,479
Windows to Mac and you know not my

4401
03:45:30,479 --> 03:45:33,420
desktop or you know somebody else's or

4402
03:45:33,420 --> 03:45:35,120
somebody's Cloud right

4403
03:45:35,120 --> 03:45:37,920
which uh you know getting all the tools

4404
03:45:37,920 --> 03:45:39,420
back sometimes there's you know

4405
03:45:39,420 --> 03:45:41,520
conflicts with even just the the service

4406
03:45:41,520 --> 03:45:43,260
or system that you're you're currently

4407
03:45:43,260 --> 03:45:45,380
running

4408
03:45:47,160 --> 03:45:49,859
all right so the reinstalled

4409
03:45:49,859 --> 03:45:51,180
um

4410
03:45:51,180 --> 03:45:53,840
so yeah

4411
03:45:54,779 --> 03:45:56,900
all right let's hop over

4412
03:45:56,900 --> 03:45:57,600
[Music]

4413
03:45:57,600 --> 03:45:59,279
um

4414
03:45:59,279 --> 03:46:02,779
to the website of everything

4415
03:46:05,040 --> 03:46:11,460
all right so uh off of the dashboard

4416
03:46:15,779 --> 03:46:18,239
all right so right off the dashboard

4417
03:46:18,239 --> 03:46:20,100
um you have like the project listing

4418
03:46:20,100 --> 03:46:24,180
itself you're able to delete it or say

4419
03:46:24,180 --> 03:46:26,520
you wanted to use the web UI we'll say

4420
03:46:26,520 --> 03:46:28,080
like you know test

4421
03:46:28,080 --> 03:46:30,359
and then if we go back

4422
03:46:30,359 --> 03:46:32,359
um

4423
03:46:33,960 --> 03:46:35,479
back in here

4424
03:46:35,479 --> 03:46:37,920
automatically updates which is kind of

4425
03:46:37,920 --> 03:46:41,100
Handy but we can look at the reports

4426
03:46:41,100 --> 03:46:43,080
that are actually being generated

4427
03:46:43,080 --> 03:46:44,520
um

4428
03:46:44,520 --> 03:46:47,399
and there we go so like DNS Recon does

4429
03:46:47,399 --> 03:46:52,319
not natively support any form of uh

4430
03:46:52,319 --> 03:46:55,380
report generation or anything like that

4431
03:46:55,380 --> 03:46:56,939
besides you know putting it in a text

4432
03:46:56,939 --> 03:46:59,479
file and depending on what you're doing

4433
03:46:59,479 --> 03:47:02,279
it's really painful to go through you

4434
03:47:02,279 --> 03:47:04,140
know hundreds of text files to like

4435
03:47:04,140 --> 03:47:06,960
actually look for something off of the

4436
03:47:06,960 --> 03:47:09,899
subparse tool that I wrote we were able

4437
03:47:09,899 --> 03:47:11,760
to like pivot off a data so that's

4438
03:47:11,760 --> 03:47:14,220
something that I plan on introducing to

4439
03:47:14,220 --> 03:47:15,779
this tool would be like you know you

4440
03:47:15,779 --> 03:47:16,979
have this table

4441
03:47:16,979 --> 03:47:19,140
say you want to look for like this value

4442
03:47:19,140 --> 03:47:20,700
throughout all the reports for that

4443
03:47:20,700 --> 03:47:23,279
company be able to Pivot and kind of dig

4444
03:47:23,279 --> 03:47:26,760
deeper into the information you found

4445
03:47:26,760 --> 03:47:28,819
um

4446
03:47:29,880 --> 03:47:31,260
see

4447
03:47:31,260 --> 03:47:34,140
um it does

4448
03:47:34,140 --> 03:47:35,640
support

4449
03:47:35,640 --> 03:47:39,779
um tasking so with the tasking say that

4450
03:47:39,779 --> 03:47:42,420
you have like six programs that you run

4451
03:47:42,420 --> 03:47:43,979
like back to back to back and that's

4452
03:47:43,979 --> 03:47:46,439
always like your flow you'll be able to

4453
03:47:46,439 --> 03:47:48,960
basically set up a task it is broken

4454
03:47:48,960 --> 03:47:51,300
right now but you are you can set up a

4455
03:47:51,300 --> 03:47:53,220
task to make it so it will auto fire and

4456
03:47:53,220 --> 03:47:55,700
do that whole chain of events for you

4457
03:47:55,700 --> 03:47:59,340
that way you know you're saving time in

4458
03:47:59,340 --> 03:48:02,700
our industry you know time is money

4459
03:48:02,700 --> 03:48:07,399
um so we'll just disc Arrow fast

4460
03:48:07,399 --> 03:48:11,420
there is one other

4461
03:48:12,060 --> 03:48:13,500
um

4462
03:48:13,500 --> 03:48:17,359
package that I'd like to show you guys

4463
03:48:26,460 --> 03:48:30,239
so this is also DNS Recon the exact same

4464
03:48:30,239 --> 03:48:33,779
same tool we just ran except this has a

4465
03:48:33,779 --> 03:48:36,540
alternate report so we can see the

4466
03:48:36,540 --> 03:48:39,739
differences between those

4467
03:49:07,020 --> 03:49:09,300
right so now this ran we'll just go

4468
03:49:09,300 --> 03:49:12,660
ahead and refresh this go back into here

4469
03:49:12,660 --> 03:49:13,800
um so they're just kind of daisy chain

4470
03:49:13,800 --> 03:49:16,439
you know time stamped so this was the

4471
03:49:16,439 --> 03:49:18,060
previous report this was all on the

4472
03:49:18,060 --> 03:49:20,939
table but say that you want them broke

4473
03:49:20,939 --> 03:49:23,819
down by different types right so now you

4474
03:49:23,819 --> 03:49:26,160
can see that hey here's all the a

4475
03:49:26,160 --> 03:49:28,319
records or you know MX records or text

4476
03:49:28,319 --> 03:49:29,600
records

4477
03:49:29,600 --> 03:49:32,700
which basically allows anybody who's

4478
03:49:32,700 --> 03:49:34,920
developing their own packages for it to

4479
03:49:34,920 --> 03:49:37,319
completely customize what they want the

4480
03:49:37,319 --> 03:49:39,120
view to look like instead of being

4481
03:49:39,120 --> 03:49:42,319
conformed to that specific

4482
03:49:42,319 --> 03:49:45,479
template the templates themselves are

4483
03:49:45,479 --> 03:49:47,000
all 100

4484
03:49:47,000 --> 03:49:50,399
dynamically generated and that's based

4485
03:49:50,399 --> 03:49:54,479
off of the Json that is used to develop

4486
03:49:54,479 --> 03:49:56,939
the package itself

4487
03:49:56,939 --> 03:49:59,340
um inside of the settings for this

4488
03:49:59,340 --> 03:50:02,700
um you know dark mode and the ungodly

4489
03:50:02,700 --> 03:50:04,979
white I don't understand I'm sorry I

4490
03:50:04,979 --> 03:50:08,340
just had to Blind you you know

4491
03:50:08,340 --> 03:50:10,200
dark mode should just be default for

4492
03:50:10,200 --> 03:50:12,359
everybody

4493
03:50:12,359 --> 03:50:14,700
um so inside the packages you can get

4494
03:50:14,700 --> 03:50:17,100
some more uh more information about

4495
03:50:17,100 --> 03:50:17,760
um

4496
03:50:17,760 --> 03:50:21,359
the the package itself the language that

4497
03:50:21,359 --> 03:50:22,739
it uses

4498
03:50:22,739 --> 03:50:24,840
um the uh you know author you can

4499
03:50:24,840 --> 03:50:28,020
uninstall directly from the web UI as

4500
03:50:28,020 --> 03:50:30,660
well so say that you are

4501
03:50:30,660 --> 03:50:34,520
uh somebody who who prefers web over CLI

4502
03:50:34,520 --> 03:50:36,960
you will be able to basically use the

4503
03:50:36,960 --> 03:50:38,819
whole thing from here there's a few

4504
03:50:38,819 --> 03:50:40,439
things I got to wrap up on that before

4505
03:50:40,439 --> 03:50:43,220
it's completed

4506
03:50:43,220 --> 03:50:48,060
to forgot to install the go Lane package

4507
03:50:48,060 --> 03:50:51,000
so let's go and do that real fast

4508
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:51,840
um

4509
03:50:51,840 --> 03:50:54,479
so right now I just have one anybody use

4510
03:50:54,479 --> 03:50:56,100
asset finder

4511
03:50:56,100 --> 03:50:58,200
by Tom nom nom

4512
03:50:58,200 --> 03:51:00,800
okay

4513
03:51:02,160 --> 03:51:05,100
um Susan as you can see right here it

4514
03:51:05,100 --> 03:51:07,260
does check for the support of the

4515
03:51:07,260 --> 03:51:09,420
language and then this one does require

4516
03:51:09,420 --> 03:51:12,000
the 1.18

4517
03:51:12,000 --> 03:51:14,000
um

4518
03:51:17,939 --> 03:51:20,700
I'll just run this real fast for you

4519
03:51:20,700 --> 03:51:22,260
guys just to

4520
03:51:22,260 --> 03:51:26,220
prove that we got multi-language

4521
03:51:28,500 --> 03:51:31,920
there we go asset finder is great for

4522
03:51:31,920 --> 03:51:34,220
those of you who aren't familiar with it

4523
03:51:34,220 --> 03:51:36,359
say that you give it like a company name

4524
03:51:36,359 --> 03:51:38,460
or domain or something like that you're

4525
03:51:38,460 --> 03:51:42,540
able to find a lot of URLs that could

4526
03:51:42,540 --> 03:51:45,060
potentially lead to other points of

4527
03:51:45,060 --> 03:51:46,920
failure or other things for you know if

4528
03:51:46,920 --> 03:51:48,720
you're a Bug Hunter to to go ahead and

4529
03:51:48,720 --> 03:51:50,460
test

4530
03:51:50,460 --> 03:51:52,080
definitely recommend checking it out

4531
03:51:52,080 --> 03:51:55,140
also for companies it's great to see

4532
03:51:55,140 --> 03:51:57,479
what information you can find on your

4533
03:51:57,479 --> 03:52:00,180
own company that other people could

4534
03:52:00,180 --> 03:52:02,819
potentially uh you know use against you

4535
03:52:02,819 --> 03:52:04,920
or or break

4536
03:52:04,920 --> 03:52:07,739
um and there we go so yeah we got the

4537
03:52:07,739 --> 03:52:09,439
the go

4538
03:52:09,439 --> 03:52:11,460
which I mean if I was to do this

4539
03:52:11,460 --> 03:52:13,800
manually installing each one of those

4540
03:52:13,800 --> 03:52:15,420
make sure all the dependencies were set

4541
03:52:15,420 --> 03:52:16,920
up on top of getting the virtual

4542
03:52:16,920 --> 03:52:18,540
environment set up it definitely

4543
03:52:18,540 --> 03:52:20,880
wouldn't be that quick on top of like

4544
03:52:20,880 --> 03:52:22,859
then turning around and running it so

4545
03:52:22,859 --> 03:52:25,800
basically the whole goal of this program

4546
03:52:25,800 --> 03:52:28,800
is to help with speed I mean there's no

4547
03:52:28,800 --> 03:52:30,180
point on spending

4548
03:52:30,180 --> 03:52:32,520
half your day setting up tools to turn

4549
03:52:32,520 --> 03:52:34,620
around and run them for what a second

4550
03:52:34,620 --> 03:52:37,380
two seconds to find a bunch of data

4551
03:52:37,380 --> 03:52:38,580
um

4552
03:52:38,580 --> 03:52:40,739
so

4553
03:52:40,739 --> 03:52:45,120
inside of the settings and then the

4554
03:52:45,120 --> 03:52:46,859
packages

4555
03:52:46,859 --> 03:52:50,760
I'm allowing for the creation of the

4556
03:52:50,760 --> 03:52:53,040
install packages through the through the

4557
03:52:53,040 --> 03:52:55,319
web UI

4558
03:52:55,319 --> 03:52:57,800
so we have the the author information

4559
03:52:57,800 --> 03:53:00,600
we have GitHub and then this is the code

4560
03:53:00,600 --> 03:53:04,020
side which the code side will require a

4561
03:53:04,020 --> 03:53:05,340
lot more you know you got to give it an

4562
03:53:05,340 --> 03:53:07,739
entry file you gotta specify you know

4563
03:53:07,739 --> 03:53:10,500
where is everything on a go but as far

4564
03:53:10,500 --> 03:53:12,359
as the GitHub

4565
03:53:12,359 --> 03:53:14,040
it's quite easy you know basically just

4566
03:53:14,040 --> 03:53:17,060
give us your dot get URL

4567
03:53:17,060 --> 03:53:20,220
inside of the the programming language

4568
03:53:20,220 --> 03:53:22,560
information these are the two languages

4569
03:53:22,560 --> 03:53:24,540
that are supported right now

4570
03:53:24,540 --> 03:53:27,120
if we go look at python

4571
03:53:27,120 --> 03:53:31,080
we got all the different versions so

4572
03:53:31,080 --> 03:53:34,260
traditional python if we go down and

4573
03:53:34,260 --> 03:53:37,680
look here you know we got iron grass uh

4574
03:53:37,680 --> 03:53:39,420
Anaconda

4575
03:53:39,420 --> 03:53:40,800
um

4576
03:53:40,800 --> 03:53:43,140
moving out C python down here somewhere

4577
03:53:43,140 --> 03:53:46,620
but uh yeah so uh basically

4578
03:53:46,620 --> 03:53:48,840
making sure that regardless of your

4579
03:53:48,840 --> 03:53:51,779
underlying needs uh that the program be

4580
03:53:51,779 --> 03:53:54,060
able to at least helps set it all up

4581
03:53:54,060 --> 03:53:55,260
um not saying that there isn't going to

4582
03:53:55,260 --> 03:53:56,100
be

4583
03:53:56,100 --> 03:53:58,140
um issues with some packages depending

4584
03:53:58,140 --> 03:54:00,120
on like what their specific requirements

4585
03:54:00,120 --> 03:54:03,899
are but this uh at least do its best

4586
03:54:03,899 --> 03:54:05,100
and then

4587
03:54:05,100 --> 03:54:06,600
basically just be able to download it

4588
03:54:06,600 --> 03:54:09,300
right here it'll actually send a query

4589
03:54:09,300 --> 03:54:13,080
out to our server and then generate that

4590
03:54:13,080 --> 03:54:16,200
package and then just download as it

4591
03:54:16,200 --> 03:54:18,660
basically a zip for you guys then your

4592
03:54:18,660 --> 03:54:21,479
your executables already to go

4593
03:54:21,479 --> 03:54:23,399
oh

4594
03:54:23,399 --> 03:54:26,399
this is currently not set up but you

4595
03:54:26,399 --> 03:54:28,680
will be able to install directly from

4596
03:54:28,680 --> 03:54:31,399
the web as well

4597
03:54:33,779 --> 03:54:35,520
ended up throwing some of the stuff on

4598
03:54:35,520 --> 03:54:37,439
the site together relatively quickly

4599
03:54:37,439 --> 03:54:40,040
this last week

4600
03:54:42,319 --> 03:54:45,540
that went a little bit quicker than what

4601
03:54:45,540 --> 03:54:50,100
I was thinking but uh but yeah uh I

4602
03:54:50,100 --> 03:54:53,399
guess does anybody have any questions or

4603
03:54:53,399 --> 03:54:56,160
any packages they might like to see at

4604
03:54:56,160 --> 03:54:58,460
some point

4605
03:55:06,120 --> 03:55:08,819
not without a different

4606
03:55:08,819 --> 03:55:12,720
file so uh it's a good point I'll show

4607
03:55:12,720 --> 03:55:14,399
you this

4608
03:55:14,399 --> 03:55:16,500
Okay so

4609
03:55:16,500 --> 03:55:19,319
inside of here so this is the one for

4610
03:55:19,319 --> 03:55:20,939
the asset Finder right so for the

4611
03:55:20,939 --> 03:55:22,040
goaling

4612
03:55:22,040 --> 03:55:24,779
this is the Json that all gets broken

4613
03:55:24,779 --> 03:55:27,260
down so you have the the language

4614
03:55:27,260 --> 03:55:29,939
the GitHub

4615
03:55:29,939 --> 03:55:32,180
and then you have a report design

4616
03:55:32,180 --> 03:55:35,880
you also have this which is for report

4617
03:55:35,880 --> 03:55:39,779
filters right so say that you're looking

4618
03:55:39,779 --> 03:55:41,819
for very very specific stuff just like

4619
03:55:41,819 --> 03:55:44,640
that DNS Recon one how it was all broke

4620
03:55:44,640 --> 03:55:45,960
down

4621
03:55:45,960 --> 03:55:48,019
um

4622
03:55:48,540 --> 03:55:51,840
like this right so we have like names or

4623
03:55:51,840 --> 03:55:54,000
grouped regex that you'd be able to use

4624
03:55:54,000 --> 03:55:55,739
on that

4625
03:55:55,739 --> 03:55:59,160
um but this this design is how

4626
03:55:59,160 --> 03:56:01,500
everything's going to look so as it

4627
03:56:01,500 --> 03:56:02,939
stands right now you wouldn't be able to

4628
03:56:02,939 --> 03:56:04,800
roll back and forth between two

4629
03:56:04,800 --> 03:56:07,140
different report like templates but that

4630
03:56:07,140 --> 03:56:10,439
is something I I do want to add

4631
03:56:10,439 --> 03:56:12,960
so this would just be for the

4632
03:56:12,960 --> 03:56:15,720
traditional standard report and that's

4633
03:56:15,720 --> 03:56:17,399
going to be

4634
03:56:17,399 --> 03:56:19,260
what this guy looks like where you just

4635
03:56:19,260 --> 03:56:21,420
have a table and everything's broken

4636
03:56:21,420 --> 03:56:22,520
down

4637
03:56:22,520 --> 03:56:26,840
versus that alternate one

4638
03:56:32,939 --> 03:56:36,359
where you have like the very long regex

4639
03:56:36,359 --> 03:56:37,640
expressions

4640
03:56:37,640 --> 03:56:41,660
and then your styling like the report

4641
03:56:41,660 --> 03:56:44,340
the report data and then everything's

4642
03:56:44,340 --> 03:56:47,279
broken into sections right so right here

4643
03:56:47,279 --> 03:56:49,859
we have different components these

4644
03:56:49,859 --> 03:56:51,899
components

4645
03:56:51,899 --> 03:56:54,060
you'll be able to stylize all the way

4646
03:56:54,060 --> 03:56:56,939
down so this is how we get through with

4647
03:56:56,939 --> 03:57:00,960
the auto report and generation pulling

4648
03:57:00,960 --> 03:57:03,120
it from here so you have the components

4649
03:57:03,120 --> 03:57:05,460
so this one would be a table and then

4650
03:57:05,460 --> 03:57:07,560
inside of this table we're going to say

4651
03:57:07,560 --> 03:57:10,739
all of our data and then everything's

4652
03:57:10,739 --> 03:57:13,380
broken down for the header and then the

4653
03:57:13,380 --> 03:57:16,739
cells so it's very customizable

4654
03:57:16,739 --> 03:57:19,859
um and it will have heavy documentation

4655
03:57:19,859 --> 03:57:23,279
on this for for like all the Json but

4656
03:57:23,279 --> 03:57:25,380
it's be easier to implement on the

4657
03:57:25,380 --> 03:57:28,080
website of everything

4658
03:57:28,080 --> 03:57:28,680
um

4659
03:57:28,680 --> 03:57:30,120
and yeah then you can you can always

4660
03:57:30,120 --> 03:57:33,300
change the layout too so say you have

4661
03:57:33,300 --> 03:57:35,520
you know 19 20 different tables or

4662
03:57:35,520 --> 03:57:36,600
something like that you'll be able to

4663
03:57:36,600 --> 03:57:38,760
move the tables up and down inside the

4664
03:57:38,760 --> 03:57:40,920
the report template

4665
03:57:40,920 --> 03:57:43,819
um at some in the future it will all be

4666
03:57:43,819 --> 03:57:48,198
able to be modified from the web though

4667
03:57:51,239 --> 03:57:53,420
um

4668
03:57:55,199 --> 03:57:58,739
yeah I know that was uh quite quick but

4669
03:57:58,739 --> 03:58:01,699
um kind of a interesting Tool uh I don't

4670
03:58:01,699 --> 03:58:04,439
present the most I'm usually

4671
03:58:04,439 --> 03:58:07,380
behind on the keyboard so hopefully you

4672
03:58:07,380 --> 03:58:09,420
guys like it if you guys are interested

4673
03:58:09,420 --> 03:58:12,239
in the project or or want to to use it

4674
03:58:12,239 --> 03:58:15,359
it will be up on GitHub I do we'll put

4675
03:58:15,359 --> 03:58:18,840
it back on this guy I do have the

4676
03:58:18,840 --> 03:58:21,060
GitHub link and everything kind of ready

4677
03:58:21,060 --> 03:58:22,439
for you guys

4678
03:58:22,439 --> 03:58:24,120
um

4679
03:58:24,120 --> 03:58:26,100
so if you guys want to follow on there

4680
03:58:26,100 --> 03:58:28,020
or whatnot I got the subparse program

4681
03:58:28,020 --> 03:58:31,880
and lots of other fun little tools

4682
03:58:32,100 --> 03:58:34,560
so some of the other stuff that that

4683
03:58:34,560 --> 03:58:36,779
will be coming is finishing up the

4684
03:58:36,779 --> 03:58:39,300
tasking we're going to add like Sox 4

4685
03:58:39,300 --> 03:58:42,060
and Sox five I know like with all the

4686
03:58:42,060 --> 03:58:44,160
malware research that I was doing

4687
03:58:44,160 --> 03:58:45,720
um being able to Tunnel everything and

4688
03:58:45,720 --> 03:58:47,279
run it through Tor

4689
03:58:47,279 --> 03:58:49,920
um definitely helped so depending on use

4690
03:58:49,920 --> 03:58:52,260
cases and stuff

4691
03:58:52,260 --> 03:58:53,160
um

4692
03:58:53,160 --> 03:58:55,920
some improvements to the Web different

4693
03:58:55,920 --> 03:58:57,479
languages that we're also going to

4694
03:58:57,479 --> 03:58:59,460
support if you guys ever have like some

4695
03:58:59,460 --> 03:59:01,560
Oddball language that you want more

4696
03:59:01,560 --> 03:59:03,779
support for I'd definitely be willing to

4697
03:59:03,779 --> 03:59:06,540
do it there's my GitHub and my Twitter I

4698
03:59:06,540 --> 03:59:10,819
don't do a lot on Twitter but yeah

4699
03:59:11,160 --> 03:59:11,819
um

4700
03:59:11,819 --> 03:59:13,380
so hopefully hopefully you guys like it

4701
03:59:13,380 --> 03:59:16,260
find it useful at some point or what

4702
03:59:16,260 --> 03:59:19,279
thank you

4703
03:59:21,000 --> 03:59:24,319
[Applause]

4704
03:59:24,319 --> 03:59:27,600
awesome thank you Aaron so he's going to

4705
03:59:27,600 --> 03:59:28,560
be sticking around a little bit so if

4706
03:59:28,560 --> 03:59:29,939
you have any questions feel free to head

4707
03:59:29,939 --> 03:59:31,439
on over to him and ask him questions

4708
03:59:31,439 --> 03:59:33,720
otherwise we'll have our next talk at

4709
03:59:33,720 --> 03:59:35,760
2PM when it's where Charlene Goldfield

4710
03:59:35,760 --> 03:59:37,199
is going to be giving us a presentation

4711
03:59:37,199 --> 03:59:39,359
on cyber security law and regulations

4712
03:59:39,359 --> 03:59:41,220
surrounding that so we'll break until

4713
03:59:41,220 --> 03:59:43,819
2PM

4714
04:29:35,899 --> 04:29:39,180
so that was really interesting but yes

4715
04:29:39,180 --> 04:29:42,180
as Annabelle mentioned I work for DHS

4716
04:29:42,180 --> 04:29:43,920
um I wasn't working at DHS all the time

4717
04:29:43,920 --> 04:29:46,560
before that I was working at the Federal

4718
04:29:46,560 --> 04:29:48,540
Communications Commission I worked at

4719
04:29:48,540 --> 04:29:50,220
Department of Justice so I had like a

4720
04:29:50,220 --> 04:29:51,720
couple of like experiences in different

4721
04:29:51,720 --> 04:29:54,540
agencies so um it's kind of great to be

4722
04:29:54,540 --> 04:29:56,760
here because you get the break from the

4723
04:29:56,760 --> 04:29:58,979
bureaucracy of DC

4724
04:29:58,979 --> 04:30:01,920
um and uh the uh nonsense sometimes that

4725
04:30:01,920 --> 04:30:03,300
happens I can say that I'm in my

4726
04:30:03,300 --> 04:30:05,880
personal capacity but at the same time

4727
04:30:05,880 --> 04:30:08,159
it's really great to be in that area in

4728
04:30:08,159 --> 04:30:09,899
that space because you get to be in the

4729
04:30:09,899 --> 04:30:12,300
conversations and actually bring in some

4730
04:30:12,300 --> 04:30:15,120
common sense at times especially in this

4731
04:30:15,120 --> 04:30:18,659
space and I know that I am speaking to

4732
04:30:18,659 --> 04:30:20,220
many of you that are mostly

4733
04:30:20,220 --> 04:30:22,439
technologists or actually experiencing

4734
04:30:22,439 --> 04:30:25,020
the things that we try to dictate in

4735
04:30:25,020 --> 04:30:27,300
policy so I tried to make this

4736
04:30:27,300 --> 04:30:29,340
presentation as broad as possible but

4737
04:30:29,340 --> 04:30:31,439
again I don't consider myself an expert

4738
04:30:31,439 --> 04:30:33,960
in the things that you do I am an expert

4739
04:30:33,960 --> 04:30:36,180
in the law side of things and I learned

4740
04:30:36,180 --> 04:30:38,220
things from those like you and your

4741
04:30:38,220 --> 04:30:40,260
positions that tell me how it works and

4742
04:30:40,260 --> 04:30:42,600
I learn things along the way so one of

4743
04:30:42,600 --> 04:30:44,220
the great things about being in this

4744
04:30:44,220 --> 04:30:45,479
space is that I've been able to like

4745
04:30:45,479 --> 04:30:47,520
teach myself stuff and actually take

4746
04:30:47,520 --> 04:30:50,159
other classes and supplement my learning

4747
04:30:50,159 --> 04:30:51,859
under my ethical duties as an attorney

4748
04:30:51,859 --> 04:30:54,359
which is kind of cool versus when you go

4749
04:30:54,359 --> 04:30:55,680
to law school and you just do some like

4750
04:30:55,680 --> 04:30:57,060
property or something like that it's

4751
04:30:57,060 --> 04:30:58,380
like you get what you get and that's

4752
04:30:58,380 --> 04:31:00,540
about it right so that's the cool thing

4753
04:31:00,540 --> 04:31:02,819
about what I do and I also get to work

4754
04:31:02,819 --> 04:31:04,439
with really cool people in the policy

4755
04:31:04,439 --> 04:31:06,180
space that have been in your positions

4756
04:31:06,180 --> 04:31:08,220
or have worked in technology companies

4757
04:31:08,220 --> 04:31:11,220
or done things on that side and they

4758
04:31:11,220 --> 04:31:14,279
actually get to also bring in the policy

4759
04:31:14,279 --> 04:31:16,020
side and bring in more common sense and

4760
04:31:16,020 --> 04:31:17,220
be like this isn't going to work on

4761
04:31:17,220 --> 04:31:19,500
paper for those that are doing this on a

4762
04:31:19,500 --> 04:31:20,880
day-to-day basis

4763
04:31:20,880 --> 04:31:21,979
so

4764
04:31:21,979 --> 04:31:23,640
one thing

4765
04:31:23,640 --> 04:31:26,159
I wanted to go ahead kind of give a

4766
04:31:26,159 --> 04:31:28,620
little glimpse of my background and why

4767
04:31:28,620 --> 04:31:30,600
I think you know law and policy is so

4768
04:31:30,600 --> 04:31:32,520
important here let me I think that it'd

4769
04:31:32,520 --> 04:31:33,479
be worth

4770
04:31:33,479 --> 04:31:37,020
like this so I have worked in the

4771
04:31:37,020 --> 04:31:38,340
federal government space for like six

4772
04:31:38,340 --> 04:31:41,520
years now as a lawyer and before that I

4773
04:31:41,520 --> 04:31:43,260
worked in like local government back at

4774
04:31:43,260 --> 04:31:45,120
home in Miami Florida and I did some

4775
04:31:45,120 --> 04:31:47,420
stuff here and there in the policy side

4776
04:31:47,420 --> 04:31:51,180
and so I think that it's so important to

4777
04:31:51,180 --> 04:31:54,060
kind of understand the basics of what

4778
04:31:54,060 --> 04:31:55,800
the lawyers and the policy people are

4779
04:31:55,800 --> 04:31:58,140
thinking about in the room on this side

4780
04:31:58,140 --> 04:32:01,319
because you all bring the experience and

4781
04:32:01,319 --> 04:32:03,180
understanding where they're coming from

4782
04:32:03,180 --> 04:32:06,120
too and how it all works on that side

4783
04:32:06,120 --> 04:32:08,100
with the law and policy will help make

4784
04:32:08,100 --> 04:32:10,199
your jobs a lot easier depending on what

4785
04:32:10,199 --> 04:32:13,319
you do right so that is why I wanted to

4786
04:32:13,319 --> 04:32:15,779
bring in this presentation and of course

4787
04:32:15,779 --> 04:32:18,180
feel free to jump in if you have any

4788
04:32:18,180 --> 04:32:19,979
questions along the way or if there's

4789
04:32:19,979 --> 04:32:21,899
things that maybe I didn't bring up that

4790
04:32:21,899 --> 04:32:24,239
are crucial to understand and that way

4791
04:32:24,239 --> 04:32:25,979
you know we can have a conversation if

4792
04:32:25,979 --> 04:32:27,720
you have anything further we can discuss

4793
04:32:27,720 --> 04:32:31,080
about it right so one thing before I

4794
04:32:31,080 --> 04:32:33,060
forget is that I have to say that I am

4795
04:32:33,060 --> 04:32:35,040
in my personal capacity and I am not

4796
04:32:35,040 --> 04:32:37,260
expressing the opinions of DHS or any of

4797
04:32:37,260 --> 04:32:38,699
the federal government I have to give

4798
04:32:38,699 --> 04:32:40,500
that quote so

4799
04:32:40,500 --> 04:32:44,060
um ethical things there so

4800
04:32:44,220 --> 04:32:47,279
um really quickly when we talk about

4801
04:32:47,279 --> 04:32:49,979
like Cyber Law and policy although we

4802
04:32:49,979 --> 04:32:53,220
always had the uh deterrence model where

4803
04:32:53,220 --> 04:32:55,739
I guess the security angle of things

4804
04:32:55,739 --> 04:32:57,420
back when the you know the technology

4805
04:32:57,420 --> 04:32:59,460
era started or computer and the internet

4806
04:32:59,460 --> 04:33:01,560
we had like the antivirus software

4807
04:33:01,560 --> 04:33:03,659
that's about it right and then slowly

4808
04:33:03,659 --> 04:33:05,039
things progressed here and there

4809
04:33:05,039 --> 04:33:08,520
historically however as a result of 9 11

4810
04:33:08,520 --> 04:33:12,240
and the creation of DHS right we started

4811
04:33:12,240 --> 04:33:14,458
thinking about how our adversaries and

4812
04:33:14,458 --> 04:33:16,080
National Security play a part in

4813
04:33:16,080 --> 04:33:19,859
technology and in the you know terrorism

4814
04:33:19,859 --> 04:33:24,000
space we saw how terrorists or foreign

4815
04:33:24,000 --> 04:33:25,680
adversaries or however you want to

4816
04:33:25,680 --> 04:33:28,320
Define them utilize technology

4817
04:33:28,320 --> 04:33:31,379
to recruit their individuals to provide

4818
04:33:31,379 --> 04:33:34,561
disinformation to just you know spread

4819
04:33:34,561 --> 04:33:36,660
awareness of the things that they do for

4820
04:33:36,660 --> 04:33:37,980
their positions right because terrorism

4821
04:33:37,980 --> 04:33:41,180
is a domestic political International

4822
04:33:41,180 --> 04:33:45,000
movement right so we saw how that on

4823
04:33:45,000 --> 04:33:46,919
that space is utilized for technology

4824
04:33:46,919 --> 04:33:49,500
but then there's another side to it

4825
04:33:49,500 --> 04:33:52,199
right there's the Cyber side there is

4826
04:33:52,199 --> 04:33:54,240
the hacking side all those things that

4827
04:33:54,240 --> 04:33:56,160
we discussed and I know that the

4828
04:33:56,160 --> 04:33:57,419
commander this morning spoke a little

4829
04:33:57,419 --> 04:33:59,278
bit about those things those are the

4830
04:33:59,278 --> 04:34:01,020
things that I try to focus on as well

4831
04:34:01,020 --> 04:34:03,419
but it's all like interconnected right

4832
04:34:03,419 --> 04:34:07,259
so that is why I wanted to raise some

4833
04:34:07,259 --> 04:34:09,778
hypotheticals on the Cyber side of

4834
04:34:09,778 --> 04:34:11,099
course this isn't everything that

4835
04:34:11,099 --> 04:34:12,419
happens every day

4836
04:34:12,419 --> 04:34:15,180
but even though these might sound kind

4837
04:34:15,180 --> 04:34:17,699
of a little funky they can happen right

4838
04:34:17,699 --> 04:34:19,259
or at least they're issues that can come

4839
04:34:19,259 --> 04:34:20,400
up so

4840
04:34:20,400 --> 04:34:22,980
the first thing is thinking about if

4841
04:34:22,980 --> 04:34:24,958
you're responsible for purchasing

4842
04:34:24,958 --> 04:34:27,061
certain telecommunications or networking

4843
04:34:27,061 --> 04:34:29,039
equipment right and if you're thinking

4844
04:34:29,039 --> 04:34:30,958
about buying that if you're an

4845
04:34:30,958 --> 04:34:33,299
information security officer a ciso

4846
04:34:33,299 --> 04:34:36,719
somebody who's responsible for buying

4847
04:34:36,719 --> 04:34:38,580
this equipment right for building your

4848
04:34:38,580 --> 04:34:40,740
networks you have to think about the

4849
04:34:40,740 --> 04:34:42,299
fact that if you're using a foreign

4850
04:34:42,299 --> 04:34:43,919
company right because they're probably

4851
04:34:43,919 --> 04:34:45,240
going to come in at the bid that's

4852
04:34:45,240 --> 04:34:46,199
cheaper

4853
04:34:46,199 --> 04:34:48,660
or they're gonna try to persuade you to

4854
04:34:48,660 --> 04:34:50,641
think hey my equipment is so much better

4855
04:34:50,641 --> 04:34:52,919
you know we can work hand in hand better

4856
04:34:52,919 --> 04:34:55,320
you have to think about who that foreign

4857
04:34:55,320 --> 04:34:57,240
company is and what they're trying to

4858
04:34:57,240 --> 04:35:00,359
provide you and if it's something that

4859
04:35:00,359 --> 04:35:02,039
could affect U.S competition because

4860
04:35:02,039 --> 04:35:03,599
that's one of the things it could affect

4861
04:35:03,599 --> 04:35:06,900
U.S risk or national security risk and

4862
04:35:06,900 --> 04:35:09,419
is it banned because we have equipment

4863
04:35:09,419 --> 04:35:12,118
that's banned right or at least

4864
04:35:12,118 --> 04:35:14,641
quote unquote on a naughty list is what

4865
04:35:14,641 --> 04:35:18,061
we call it during the fcc's policy

4866
04:35:18,061 --> 04:35:20,160
the second hypothetical is looking at

4867
04:35:20,160 --> 04:35:23,340
whether you are um a ciso right and

4868
04:35:23,340 --> 04:35:24,958
you've been locked out of a computer you

4869
04:35:24,958 --> 04:35:26,520
get a call saying I've been locked on a

4870
04:35:26,520 --> 04:35:27,419
computer

4871
04:35:27,419 --> 04:35:29,580
there's something weird happening I

4872
04:35:29,580 --> 04:35:31,259
can't access anything there's like a

4873
04:35:31,259 --> 04:35:32,641
weird little Gremlin thing happening

4874
04:35:32,641 --> 04:35:33,719
right

4875
04:35:33,719 --> 04:35:35,820
what do you do right do I have to report

4876
04:35:35,820 --> 04:35:38,160
this should I report this like what's

4877
04:35:38,160 --> 04:35:41,278
going on how do I save the data can I

4878
04:35:41,278 --> 04:35:43,320
pay that Ransom if they're asking for

4879
04:35:43,320 --> 04:35:44,938
Bitcoin if they're asking for money

4880
04:35:44,938 --> 04:35:47,099
right all those things are things you

4881
04:35:47,099 --> 04:35:48,359
have to think about because they're

4882
04:35:48,359 --> 04:35:51,539
obligations legally policy wise and just

4883
04:35:51,539 --> 04:35:53,759
for your position and your safety and

4884
04:35:53,759 --> 04:35:55,618
we'll talk about what that means in a

4885
04:35:55,618 --> 04:35:56,520
little bit

4886
04:35:56,520 --> 04:35:59,879
and then third you are a ciso who is in

4887
04:35:59,879 --> 04:36:02,160
charge of systems for a company right

4888
04:36:02,160 --> 04:36:04,799
you are made aware of a data breach but

4889
04:36:04,799 --> 04:36:07,141
are told by the c-suite to make sure

4890
04:36:07,141 --> 04:36:09,240
this goes away that also goes to the

4891
04:36:09,240 --> 04:36:11,099
second hypothetical can you make it go

4892
04:36:11,099 --> 04:36:13,099
away like that quote unquote right

4893
04:36:13,099 --> 04:36:16,799
absolutely not don't do that please

4894
04:36:16,799 --> 04:36:18,958
um but we'll talk about what that means

4895
04:36:18,958 --> 04:36:21,180
and like why we say that and why we urge

4896
04:36:21,180 --> 04:36:23,580
you not to do that for purposes of

4897
04:36:23,580 --> 04:36:24,900
shareholders if you're a public company

4898
04:36:24,900 --> 04:36:28,320
let's say yeah those type of things

4899
04:36:28,320 --> 04:36:29,879
so

4900
04:36:29,879 --> 04:36:32,219
um why do we care about law and policy

4901
04:36:32,219 --> 04:36:35,099
in cyber right these are some of the

4902
04:36:35,099 --> 04:36:37,199
four basic things that come up and I

4903
04:36:37,199 --> 04:36:38,458
think someone mentioned this morning

4904
04:36:38,458 --> 04:36:42,240
Tick Tock right the CEO went to Congress

4905
04:36:42,240 --> 04:36:44,039
I can talk about them in my personal

4906
04:36:44,039 --> 04:36:45,660
capacity right

4907
04:36:45,660 --> 04:36:46,919
um

4908
04:36:46,919 --> 04:36:50,278
um they uh had the CEO for tick tock on

4909
04:36:50,278 --> 04:36:53,278
the U.S foreign relations side come and

4910
04:36:53,278 --> 04:36:55,438
testify in front of Congress to ask him

4911
04:36:55,438 --> 04:36:58,438
a bunch of questions about you know how

4912
04:36:58,438 --> 04:37:00,900
is it unsecure should we make you sell

4913
04:37:00,900 --> 04:37:02,759
can you even do that can the US

4914
04:37:02,759 --> 04:37:05,759
government make you sell yes we can we

4915
04:37:05,759 --> 04:37:07,379
can make you sell

4916
04:37:07,379 --> 04:37:08,699
um but

4917
04:37:08,699 --> 04:37:10,379
um regardless these are the four things

4918
04:37:10,379 --> 04:37:13,141
that we always sort of

4919
04:37:13,141 --> 04:37:15,438
getting conversation with regards to

4920
04:37:15,438 --> 04:37:18,840
technology and cyber and policy we're

4921
04:37:18,840 --> 04:37:20,759
worried about this space because of

4922
04:37:20,759 --> 04:37:23,099
national and domestic security we have

4923
04:37:23,099 --> 04:37:26,160
deep fakes we have hacks we have

4924
04:37:26,160 --> 04:37:28,500
ransomware we have foreign adversaries

4925
04:37:28,500 --> 04:37:31,379
we have all those things to think about

4926
04:37:31,379 --> 04:37:34,500
and that's why Us in the law and policy

4927
04:37:34,500 --> 04:37:37,320
space are like hey we have to take care

4928
04:37:37,320 --> 04:37:39,359
of all that's happening because it's

4929
04:37:39,359 --> 04:37:41,820
happening in real time all the time

4930
04:37:41,820 --> 04:37:43,919
every day right

4931
04:37:43,919 --> 04:37:47,219
we have economic purposes so yes we do

4932
04:37:47,219 --> 04:37:48,719
worry about National Security

4933
04:37:48,719 --> 04:37:51,480
we worry about our homeland we worry

4934
04:37:51,480 --> 04:37:53,820
about critical infrastructures but we

4935
04:37:53,820 --> 04:37:55,438
also want to make sure that we are

4936
04:37:55,438 --> 04:37:58,219
competing right this is a global economy

4937
04:37:58,219 --> 04:38:01,438
we want to make sure it's fair that all

4938
04:38:01,438 --> 04:38:04,141
companies compete fairly on our end and

4939
04:38:04,141 --> 04:38:05,759
that we're also making sure that our

4940
04:38:05,759 --> 04:38:09,480
talent is here right and that we take

4941
04:38:09,480 --> 04:38:11,699
care of our talent and then also that

4942
04:38:11,699 --> 04:38:13,759
we're not just letting companies export

4943
04:38:13,759 --> 04:38:16,919
freely in a bad way right because that

4944
04:38:16,919 --> 04:38:20,099
can happen or that we are making sure

4945
04:38:20,099 --> 04:38:22,919
that we can compete fairly in the US and

4946
04:38:22,919 --> 04:38:25,980
that our economic interests are being

4947
04:38:25,980 --> 04:38:29,641
protected that our IPS not being stolen

4948
04:38:29,641 --> 04:38:31,799
or intellectual property and things like

4949
04:38:31,799 --> 04:38:33,359
that so that's why we always talk about

4950
04:38:33,359 --> 04:38:37,141
in cyber uh policy and law with regards

4951
04:38:37,141 --> 04:38:39,299
to economic purposes

4952
04:38:39,299 --> 04:38:42,180
then we have industry balance we want to

4953
04:38:42,180 --> 04:38:43,859
make sure that we create a fair and

4954
04:38:43,859 --> 04:38:45,599
stable system so we're not having

4955
04:38:45,599 --> 04:38:47,879
companies underpin other individuals or

4956
04:38:47,879 --> 04:38:50,160
other companies foreign companies

4957
04:38:50,160 --> 04:38:52,259
underpin U.S companies

4958
04:38:52,259 --> 04:38:53,699
and then also that we're making sure

4959
04:38:53,699 --> 04:38:55,080
that the companies that we're working

4960
04:38:55,080 --> 04:38:57,118
with are creating good standards right

4961
04:38:57,118 --> 04:38:59,759
like because as you saw or you know as

4962
04:38:59,759 --> 04:39:02,340
we talk about these things a lot of our

4963
04:39:02,340 --> 04:39:04,141
technology space is unregulated right

4964
04:39:04,141 --> 04:39:06,599
and so depending on what side you're on

4965
04:39:06,599 --> 04:39:07,799
maybe you think hey we shouldn't

4966
04:39:07,799 --> 04:39:10,500
regulate that's another discussion right

4967
04:39:10,500 --> 04:39:13,500
but regardless in an unregulated space

4968
04:39:13,500 --> 04:39:15,958
we make sure that those companies you

4969
04:39:15,958 --> 04:39:18,061
know responsibly act right like they

4970
04:39:18,061 --> 04:39:20,219
take care of their their people and they

4971
04:39:20,219 --> 04:39:21,359
take care of what they're doing

4972
04:39:21,359 --> 04:39:22,859
especially if they're holders of big

4973
04:39:22,859 --> 04:39:25,199
data and then at the same time that

4974
04:39:25,199 --> 04:39:26,520
they're creating these standards among

4975
04:39:26,520 --> 04:39:28,799
themselves in a community right

4976
04:39:28,799 --> 04:39:31,020
so one example of just this one because

4977
04:39:31,020 --> 04:39:33,240
I was reading an article about AI

4978
04:39:33,240 --> 04:39:36,778
AI is expensive AI has a lot of data to

4979
04:39:36,778 --> 04:39:39,780
build like chat GPT open Ai and all

4980
04:39:39,780 --> 04:39:42,060
these other ones the biggest investors

4981
04:39:42,060 --> 04:39:44,760
are Amazon Google meta

4982
04:39:44,760 --> 04:39:46,798
Etc right like the biggest top companies

4983
04:39:46,798 --> 04:39:49,440
but what about smaller companies how are

4984
04:39:49,440 --> 04:39:51,360
we going to be able to help them compete

4985
04:39:51,360 --> 04:39:52,920
in this space because if AI is going to

4986
04:39:52,920 --> 04:39:55,200
take over right or at least not take

4987
04:39:55,200 --> 04:39:57,900
over but you know be part of the system

4988
04:39:57,900 --> 04:40:00,120
right which is great I think that AI is

4989
04:40:00,120 --> 04:40:01,680
great I've used tragic BT it's awesome

4990
04:40:01,680 --> 04:40:04,100
right for teaching my classes sometimes

4991
04:40:04,100 --> 04:40:07,140
so but if we want to make sure that we

4992
04:40:07,140 --> 04:40:09,660
are creating a balance right we don't

4993
04:40:09,660 --> 04:40:11,940
want to just have the biggest companies

4994
04:40:11,940 --> 04:40:13,920
at the top controlling everything or at

4995
04:40:13,920 --> 04:40:15,840
least that's what the article is arguing

4996
04:40:15,840 --> 04:40:18,540
how do we make it fair for everyone to

4997
04:40:18,540 --> 04:40:20,280
compete in this space especially if it's

4998
04:40:20,280 --> 04:40:22,440
the next revolution of Technology right

4999
04:40:22,440 --> 04:40:24,780
so that's another Conversation Piece

5000
04:40:24,780 --> 04:40:26,820
there

5001
04:40:26,820 --> 04:40:28,620
so yeah so

5002
04:40:28,620 --> 04:40:29,760
um one of the things that I really

5003
04:40:29,760 --> 04:40:31,740
wanted to you know if you you know

5004
04:40:31,740 --> 04:40:33,600
listen here and you're like I don't care

5005
04:40:33,600 --> 04:40:35,820
about law I don't care about posi I'm

5006
04:40:35,820 --> 04:40:37,260
just here because I want to hear like

5007
04:40:37,260 --> 04:40:40,320
the main gist of anything is this

5008
04:40:40,320 --> 04:40:42,600
that cyber security is no longer just

5009
04:40:42,600 --> 04:40:45,718
about information technologists in one

5010
04:40:45,718 --> 04:40:48,420
group the people here on the other group

5011
04:40:48,420 --> 04:40:49,680
et cetera et cetera we're all coming

5012
04:40:49,680 --> 04:40:51,780
together and I hope that's the point of

5013
04:40:51,780 --> 04:40:53,520
this conversation because I want to

5014
04:40:53,520 --> 04:40:55,260
learn from you just as much as you

5015
04:40:55,260 --> 04:40:56,580
probably want to learn from me because

5016
04:40:56,580 --> 04:40:59,640
lawyers are here to protect people from

5017
04:40:59,640 --> 04:41:02,400
bad things right or at least that's what

5018
04:41:02,400 --> 04:41:05,280
I you know my my oath was like I don't

5019
04:41:05,280 --> 04:41:07,200
know about other attorneys and usually

5020
04:41:07,200 --> 04:41:08,400
as the only attorney in the room

5021
04:41:08,400 --> 04:41:11,040
sometimes people are like oh God damn

5022
04:41:11,040 --> 04:41:13,560
attorney great but you know that's not

5023
04:41:13,560 --> 04:41:16,680
the point of at least our goals in this

5024
04:41:16,680 --> 04:41:18,480
space well that with us attorneys and

5025
04:41:18,480 --> 04:41:20,340
what we do we try to make sure that we

5026
04:41:20,340 --> 04:41:22,138
are here for our client and that we can

5027
04:41:22,138 --> 04:41:23,820
protect them at the same time let them

5028
04:41:23,820 --> 04:41:25,500
do what they want to do

5029
04:41:25,500 --> 04:41:28,138
in a great like in a scale of things and

5030
04:41:28,138 --> 04:41:30,000
a balance right and making sure that it

5031
04:41:30,000 --> 04:41:32,100
doesn't violate anything and go against

5032
04:41:32,100 --> 04:41:35,100
the Spectrum so this quote right here is

5033
04:41:35,100 --> 04:41:37,080
really interesting because you have

5034
04:41:37,080 --> 04:41:39,240
someone from University of Maryland a

5035
04:41:39,240 --> 04:41:41,940
program director he actually runs their

5036
04:41:41,940 --> 04:41:44,700
uh JD side of things or law school side

5037
04:41:44,700 --> 04:41:47,218
of cyber as well as the master's program

5038
04:41:47,218 --> 04:41:49,860
side of things and he talks about how

5039
04:41:49,860 --> 04:41:51,718
it's so important to make sure that you

5040
04:41:51,718 --> 04:41:54,920
teach both sides of this space

5041
04:41:54,920 --> 04:41:58,080
and then you also have the national

5042
04:41:58,080 --> 04:42:00,120
cyber strategy that just came out by

5043
04:42:00,120 --> 04:42:02,458
President Biden and I mean that's just

5044
04:42:02,458 --> 04:42:04,320
basically policy it's not like law or

5045
04:42:04,320 --> 04:42:05,218
anything

5046
04:42:05,218 --> 04:42:07,860
and that strategy is also actually

5047
04:42:07,860 --> 04:42:10,200
important because you know people in the

5048
04:42:10,200 --> 04:42:12,660
space always look for that strategy like

5049
04:42:12,660 --> 04:42:14,160
what's the executive government looking

5050
04:42:14,160 --> 04:42:16,620
at and what is Congress being urged to

5051
04:42:16,620 --> 04:42:18,840
look at right and one of the things that

5052
04:42:18,840 --> 04:42:21,000
came out from that report is looking at

5053
04:42:21,000 --> 04:42:22,680
what government's role is in this space

5054
04:42:22,680 --> 04:42:24,958
and basically it's the protected systems

5055
04:42:24,958 --> 04:42:28,378
ensure private entities are you know

5056
04:42:28,378 --> 04:42:29,878
particularly critical infrastructures

5057
04:42:29,878 --> 04:42:33,000
being protected and that you know that

5058
04:42:33,000 --> 04:42:34,620
we carry out the core governmental

5059
04:42:34,620 --> 04:42:37,560
functions such as engaging in diplomacy

5060
04:42:37,560 --> 04:42:40,260
collecting intelligence imposing

5061
04:42:40,260 --> 04:42:43,200
economic costs enforcing the law Etc

5062
04:42:43,200 --> 04:42:45,060
right that's a lot for Cyber Law and

5063
04:42:45,060 --> 04:42:47,878
policy that maybe years ago people be

5064
04:42:47,878 --> 04:42:50,040
like why why is this about investment

5065
04:42:50,040 --> 04:42:52,560
right but now it is right and I think

5066
04:42:52,560 --> 04:42:54,718
it's just as valuable as making sure we

5067
04:42:54,718 --> 04:42:58,878
protect National Security risks

5068
04:42:59,940 --> 04:43:02,820
so one of the other things that I think

5069
04:43:02,820 --> 04:43:06,060
I've sort of implied is that we don't

5070
04:43:06,060 --> 04:43:09,540
want to create these separate little

5071
04:43:09,540 --> 04:43:12,180
entities or groups because we have

5072
04:43:12,180 --> 04:43:13,980
lawyers that look at this of what you do

5073
04:43:13,980 --> 04:43:15,780
like this right like lawyers think that

5074
04:43:15,780 --> 04:43:17,700
that's exactly what you do every day in

5075
04:43:17,700 --> 04:43:19,860
this space if they're not Cyber Law

5076
04:43:19,860 --> 04:43:22,138
policy individuals right and they're

5077
04:43:22,138 --> 04:43:25,260
like what explain to me this in layman's

5078
04:43:25,260 --> 04:43:27,600
terms right and that's why I have this

5079
04:43:27,600 --> 04:43:28,798
little picture here I don't know if you

5080
04:43:28,798 --> 04:43:31,200
can read it which the shirt that says a

5081
04:43:31,200 --> 04:43:33,360
threat actor equals someone who wants to

5082
04:43:33,360 --> 04:43:35,160
punch me in the face right like

5083
04:43:35,160 --> 04:43:37,920
explaining things in layman's terms for

5084
04:43:37,920 --> 04:43:40,920
people because us lawyers also probably

5085
04:43:40,920 --> 04:43:43,500
speak to you and you're like this right

5086
04:43:43,500 --> 04:43:45,600
you're like what is happening like

5087
04:43:45,600 --> 04:43:46,680
you're telling me all these things like

5088
04:43:46,680 --> 04:43:48,540
Fourth Amendment protections of privacy

5089
04:43:48,540 --> 04:43:50,400
and security and you needed a warrant

5090
04:43:50,400 --> 04:43:52,560
and you need this and you need that and

5091
04:43:52,560 --> 04:43:54,180
you know and you're like what is

5092
04:43:54,180 --> 04:43:55,860
happening I'm not getting arrested am I

5093
04:43:55,860 --> 04:43:58,378
like what's happening so that is why

5094
04:43:58,378 --> 04:44:00,660
again I want to emphasize that my

5095
04:44:00,660 --> 04:44:02,400
conversation here my presentation is

5096
04:44:02,400 --> 04:44:05,400
mostly to make sure that we can all come

5097
04:44:05,400 --> 04:44:08,580
together and discuss what's going on

5098
04:44:08,580 --> 04:44:11,040
every day right in your spaces and in my

5099
04:44:11,040 --> 04:44:13,820
spaces right

5100
04:44:13,820 --> 04:44:17,400
so a little bit about the timeline of

5101
04:44:17,400 --> 04:44:19,260
Law and policy right I talked a little

5102
04:44:19,260 --> 04:44:21,780
bit about 9 11 right and how it kind of

5103
04:44:21,780 --> 04:44:24,240
shifted things in how we think about

5104
04:44:24,240 --> 04:44:27,780
National Security overall right and then

5105
04:44:27,780 --> 04:44:30,480
how we thought about technology but then

5106
04:44:30,480 --> 04:44:32,458
we kind of saw a little bit more about

5107
04:44:32,458 --> 04:44:34,560
Cyber Law and policy being implemented

5108
04:44:34,560 --> 04:44:38,760
or discussed in the executive branch in

5109
04:44:38,760 --> 04:44:41,040
Congress and in States right because now

5110
04:44:41,040 --> 04:44:42,600
right now you're seeing a lot of States

5111
04:44:42,600 --> 04:44:45,900
doing their own thing with privacy with

5112
04:44:45,900 --> 04:44:48,060
cyber protection with cyber information

5113
04:44:48,060 --> 04:44:51,540
sharing and so you're like how do I get

5114
04:44:51,540 --> 04:44:53,940
control of all this information like if

5115
04:44:53,940 --> 04:44:57,060
I'm working somewhere in like Florida or

5116
04:44:57,060 --> 04:44:59,940
Illinois or wherever I also have to

5117
04:44:59,940 --> 04:45:01,920
worry about what they're monitoring what

5118
04:45:01,920 --> 04:45:03,780
they're telling me to do for my company

5119
04:45:03,780 --> 04:45:05,820
or wherever you might work at

5120
04:45:05,820 --> 04:45:08,700
so first of all we had President Obama's

5121
04:45:08,700 --> 04:45:11,160
efforts and regarding this space right

5122
04:45:11,160 --> 04:45:13,378
one of the biggest things in his space

5123
04:45:13,378 --> 04:45:16,200
or in his I guess presidential term was

5124
04:45:16,200 --> 04:45:20,400
looking at information sharing right uh

5125
04:45:20,400 --> 04:45:22,378
Congress and you know executive went

5126
04:45:22,378 --> 04:45:25,320
back and forth as to whose obligation it

5127
04:45:25,320 --> 04:45:27,780
is to you know share information should

5128
04:45:27,780 --> 04:45:28,980
we require companies to share

5129
04:45:28,980 --> 04:45:32,100
information when you have data breaches

5130
04:45:32,100 --> 04:45:33,958
um are we violating certain violations

5131
04:45:33,958 --> 04:45:36,480
or privacy violations of companies are

5132
04:45:36,480 --> 04:45:38,340
requested to share information and then

5133
04:45:38,340 --> 04:45:40,440
they're like looking into their systems

5134
04:45:40,440 --> 04:45:42,660
and then probably looking into you know

5135
04:45:42,660 --> 04:45:45,480
people's records things like that and so

5136
04:45:45,480 --> 04:45:47,700
from that conversation back and forth it

5137
04:45:47,700 --> 04:45:50,458
resulted in the um cyber information

5138
04:45:50,458 --> 04:45:54,060
sharing Act of 2015 which basically says

5139
04:45:54,060 --> 04:45:57,060
Hey companies if you share your data

5140
04:45:57,060 --> 04:45:59,638
breaches with us right then we will

5141
04:45:59,638 --> 04:46:02,458
protect you in some way by making sure

5142
04:46:02,458 --> 04:46:03,900
that you don't get in trouble if you're

5143
04:46:03,900 --> 04:46:06,060
monitoring and Defending Your systems in

5144
04:46:06,060 --> 04:46:08,400
some way right like if you are looking

5145
04:46:08,400 --> 04:46:10,620
into records you're not going to break

5146
04:46:10,620 --> 04:46:12,540
any privacy issues you're not going to

5147
04:46:12,540 --> 04:46:14,820
break any Fourth Amendment issues ETC et

5148
04:46:14,820 --> 04:46:16,980
cetera right and then exchange you're

5149
04:46:16,980 --> 04:46:19,620
helping us the government report these

5150
04:46:19,620 --> 04:46:21,660
data breaches and helping you in

5151
04:46:21,660 --> 04:46:23,100
response and we don't know what's going

5152
04:46:23,100 --> 04:46:25,560
on right so that's one thing it doesn't

5153
04:46:25,560 --> 04:46:27,660
make it obligatory it doesn't make it

5154
04:46:27,660 --> 04:46:29,940
mandatory in any way shape or form it's

5155
04:46:29,940 --> 04:46:34,260
more of a mutual relationship right and

5156
04:46:34,260 --> 04:46:37,320
then on top of that we saw him or

5157
04:46:37,320 --> 04:46:38,820
President Obama talking a lot about

5158
04:46:38,820 --> 04:46:41,820
implementing legislative proposals

5159
04:46:41,820 --> 04:46:45,420
reports on Cyber focusing on

5160
04:46:45,420 --> 04:46:47,040
um you know diversity in the cyber

5161
04:46:47,040 --> 04:46:49,260
security although mentioned like in a

5162
04:46:49,260 --> 04:46:52,500
little sentence and cyber crime right

5163
04:46:52,500 --> 04:46:55,680
making sure that we are also monitoring

5164
04:46:55,680 --> 04:46:58,200
that side of things

5165
04:46:58,200 --> 04:47:02,040
um then uh you saw the nist and nist is

5166
04:47:02,040 --> 04:47:04,138
the National Institute of science and

5167
04:47:04,138 --> 04:47:06,540
technology or standard in technology and

5168
04:47:06,540 --> 04:47:09,240
it's its own sub-agency and they have

5169
04:47:09,240 --> 04:47:11,580
great Frameworks by the way right and so

5170
04:47:11,580 --> 04:47:13,920
they created their first framework 1.0

5171
04:47:13,920 --> 04:47:17,340
for small businesses for companies and

5172
04:47:17,340 --> 04:47:20,040
for you know all types of entities that

5173
04:47:20,040 --> 04:47:21,958
have some cyber capabilities in them

5174
04:47:21,958 --> 04:47:24,120
right so they created this first

5175
04:47:24,120 --> 04:47:27,480
framework to guide entities on making

5176
04:47:27,480 --> 04:47:28,740
sure that they're protecting their

5177
04:47:28,740 --> 04:47:30,780
systems and they're always building up

5178
04:47:30,780 --> 04:47:32,458
on it so I always put this one in here

5179
04:47:32,458 --> 04:47:35,400
because it's really important you had a

5180
04:47:35,400 --> 04:47:37,138
sub-agency in the federal government

5181
04:47:37,138 --> 04:47:39,000
making sure that they're providing and

5182
04:47:39,000 --> 04:47:41,878
pumping out resources to these companies

5183
04:47:41,878 --> 04:47:45,298
way before cisa or the cisa sub-agency

5184
04:47:45,298 --> 04:47:49,020
was created right before cisa and that

5185
04:47:49,020 --> 04:47:51,718
way that you're able to inform companies

5186
04:47:51,718 --> 04:47:53,040
and you're able to inform small

5187
04:47:53,040 --> 04:47:55,080
companies and you're providing all these

5188
04:47:55,080 --> 04:47:56,900
great little checklists

5189
04:47:56,900 --> 04:48:00,660
then you had Trump's presidential

5190
04:48:00,660 --> 04:48:03,240
um Arrow right and a lot of his

5191
04:48:03,240 --> 04:48:05,100
initiatives not only created sisa

5192
04:48:05,100 --> 04:48:08,400
actually it was ciso was long talks and

5193
04:48:08,400 --> 04:48:11,280
eventually it got passed in law and then

5194
04:48:11,280 --> 04:48:12,780
it was created under the DHS

5195
04:48:12,780 --> 04:48:14,280
sub-agencies

5196
04:48:14,280 --> 04:48:16,980
but then also you had a lot of bands

5197
04:48:16,980 --> 04:48:19,860
right you had um technology bands you

5198
04:48:19,860 --> 04:48:21,840
had Tick Tock being wanting to be banned

5199
04:48:21,840 --> 04:48:24,420
you had WeChat at the time which now I

5200
04:48:24,420 --> 04:48:26,878
don't think WeChat really is as popular

5201
04:48:26,878 --> 04:48:29,400
we had that talk and so that's where in

5202
04:48:29,400 --> 04:48:32,820
his presidential you know timeline he

5203
04:48:32,820 --> 04:48:34,798
was talking a lot about banning these

5204
04:48:34,798 --> 04:48:36,480
Technologies and that's where we start

5205
04:48:36,480 --> 04:48:38,580
seeing a lot of these discussions like

5206
04:48:38,580 --> 04:48:40,680
we're seeing now with tick tock

5207
04:48:40,680 --> 04:48:43,080
and then we had the creation of sisa

5208
04:48:43,080 --> 04:48:43,980
which is

5209
04:48:43,980 --> 04:48:46,080
um this sub-agency in DHS that really is

5210
04:48:46,080 --> 04:48:47,878
helpful in making sure that they're

5211
04:48:47,878 --> 04:48:49,860
projecting our critical infrastructures

5212
04:48:49,860 --> 04:48:51,780
right what do I mean by that I have a

5213
04:48:51,780 --> 04:48:53,280
slide on that but clearly it's just

5214
04:48:53,280 --> 04:48:56,940
basically our electrical grids our gas

5215
04:48:56,940 --> 04:48:59,520
companies all the companies that have to

5216
04:48:59,520 --> 04:49:02,340
do with our critical infrastructures of

5217
04:49:02,340 --> 04:49:05,160
making sure everyday lives of of U.S

5218
04:49:05,160 --> 04:49:08,340
citizens and U.S people are not affected

5219
04:49:08,340 --> 04:49:10,980
by cyber breaches or any cyber related

5220
04:49:10,980 --> 04:49:12,600
incidents right

5221
04:49:12,600 --> 04:49:15,060
so sis is there to help protect them and

5222
04:49:15,060 --> 04:49:17,280
to help coordinate with them and provide

5223
04:49:17,280 --> 04:49:19,620
them resources

5224
04:49:19,620 --> 04:49:22,138
then I put in cyber Solarium commission

5225
04:49:22,138 --> 04:49:24,298
and they're actually an entity that was

5226
04:49:24,298 --> 04:49:25,560
created

5227
04:49:25,560 --> 04:49:28,080
um by Congress as well and they're there

5228
04:49:28,080 --> 04:49:30,600
to provide this group of individuals

5229
04:49:30,600 --> 04:49:33,180
that are private leaders

5230
04:49:33,180 --> 04:49:35,340
um uh federal government leaders as well

5231
04:49:35,340 --> 04:49:37,740
and they talk about what's next for

5232
04:49:37,740 --> 04:49:40,080
cyber and how do we make sure that we

5233
04:49:40,080 --> 04:49:43,200
protect our cyber systems and one of the

5234
04:49:43,200 --> 04:49:44,638
things that came up from that is making

5235
04:49:44,638 --> 04:49:47,660
sure that we look at it from a military

5236
04:49:47,660 --> 04:49:50,458
civilian coordination right because

5237
04:49:50,458 --> 04:49:51,780
there's a lot of military leaders in

5238
04:49:51,780 --> 04:49:54,240
that group and so they were focusing on

5239
04:49:54,240 --> 04:49:56,458
deterrence and so when they've released

5240
04:49:56,458 --> 04:49:58,798
their first report they talked a lot

5241
04:49:58,798 --> 04:50:00,900
about deterrence how does that look like

5242
04:50:00,900 --> 04:50:03,000
and now they're building their second

5243
04:50:03,000 --> 04:50:04,500
report and so that was a really

5244
04:50:04,500 --> 04:50:06,180
interesting Commission because a lot of

5245
04:50:06,180 --> 04:50:07,920
people got good stuff from that report

5246
04:50:07,920 --> 04:50:09,958
and they saw that there was a

5247
04:50:09,958 --> 04:50:11,840
composition of very different leaders

5248
04:50:11,840 --> 04:50:15,180
across the board private and public that

5249
04:50:15,180 --> 04:50:17,878
were helping to create you know this

5250
04:50:17,878 --> 04:50:20,040
policy in itself

5251
04:50:20,040 --> 04:50:22,798
and then lastly we have President Biden

5252
04:50:22,798 --> 04:50:25,020
right now and we've seen the strategy I

5253
04:50:25,020 --> 04:50:27,320
just talked about and a lot of his

5254
04:50:27,320 --> 04:50:31,200
initiatives which is focusing a lot on

5255
04:50:31,200 --> 04:50:33,840
expanding information sharing but then

5256
04:50:33,840 --> 04:50:37,080
also critical infrastructure and he did

5257
04:50:37,080 --> 04:50:40,200
release his executive order which is

5258
04:50:40,200 --> 04:50:42,060
looking at improving Nations cyber

5259
04:50:42,060 --> 04:50:44,400
security and that came out like a year

5260
04:50:44,400 --> 04:50:47,160
ago I think or less than a year ago and

5261
04:50:47,160 --> 04:50:49,138
in that cyber security executive order

5262
04:50:49,138 --> 04:50:52,080
that's mostly like sort of law if you

5263
04:50:52,080 --> 04:50:53,940
think about it because it's his way of

5264
04:50:53,940 --> 04:50:56,520
issuing some law in some way

5265
04:50:56,520 --> 04:50:58,620
um it looked a lot at zero trust

5266
04:50:58,620 --> 04:51:01,620
implementation and making sure that we

5267
04:51:01,620 --> 04:51:03,540
are building up on that information

5268
04:51:03,540 --> 04:51:06,958
sharing and working with companies and

5269
04:51:06,958 --> 04:51:10,579
private part Public Partnerships

5270
04:51:12,298 --> 04:51:14,820
great so then I wanted to briefly talk

5271
04:51:14,820 --> 04:51:16,560
about the national cyber security

5272
04:51:16,560 --> 04:51:19,560
strategy because I think that it's not

5273
04:51:19,560 --> 04:51:21,480
only been a long time coming but I think

5274
04:51:21,480 --> 04:51:25,798
that it focuses a lot on diversity legal

5275
04:51:25,798 --> 04:51:29,100
responsibility resilience and ransomware

5276
04:51:29,100 --> 04:51:30,900
protection

5277
04:51:30,900 --> 04:51:34,138
um so one of the core things is making

5278
04:51:34,138 --> 04:51:36,660
sure that we're closing the loophole on

5279
04:51:36,660 --> 04:51:39,000
regulating certain aspects of our

5280
04:51:39,000 --> 04:51:42,060
critical sectors so making sure that our

5281
04:51:42,060 --> 04:51:44,400
electrical grids and all those that

5282
04:51:44,400 --> 04:51:46,740
compose of those companies are regulated

5283
04:51:46,740 --> 04:51:49,080
correctly or at least have been

5284
04:51:49,080 --> 04:51:50,940
addressing the gaps in those regulations

5285
04:51:50,940 --> 04:51:53,520
for cyber security looking at elections

5286
04:51:53,520 --> 04:51:56,400
and our election Frameworks Etc they

5287
04:51:56,400 --> 04:51:59,280
also Focus there on legal responsibility

5288
04:51:59,280 --> 04:52:02,480
and I wanted to highlight that because

5289
04:52:02,480 --> 04:52:06,060
in that strategy they want to focus on

5290
04:52:06,060 --> 04:52:08,700
Shifting the liability from um from

5291
04:52:08,700 --> 04:52:11,160
Everyday People right because in the

5292
04:52:11,160 --> 04:52:13,378
report it talks about how whenever

5293
04:52:13,378 --> 04:52:15,120
there's a data breach or some kind of

5294
04:52:15,120 --> 04:52:18,240
major cyber incident a lot of the costs

5295
04:52:18,240 --> 04:52:20,700
goes to Everyday citizens like people

5296
04:52:20,700 --> 04:52:22,980
consumers people that buy these

5297
04:52:22,980 --> 04:52:26,100
equipment Etc and so instead of making

5298
04:52:26,100 --> 04:52:27,600
sure that they don't you know everyday

5299
04:52:27,600 --> 04:52:30,060
people don't have to have the burden on

5300
04:52:30,060 --> 04:52:32,638
themselves they want to shift legal

5301
04:52:32,638 --> 04:52:34,798
responsibility on these companies or

5302
04:52:34,798 --> 04:52:38,040
what they call the data Brokers or those

5303
04:52:38,040 --> 04:52:40,620
that manage big data right like those

5304
04:52:40,620 --> 04:52:43,138
that are responsible for everyday Big

5305
04:52:43,138 --> 04:52:46,320
Data of their um of their company

5306
04:52:46,320 --> 04:52:48,420
so that's something that I wanted to

5307
04:52:48,420 --> 04:52:50,760
highlight and then of course

5308
04:52:50,760 --> 04:52:53,820
um resiliency is always important but it

5309
04:52:53,820 --> 04:52:55,320
focused a lot on that and their

5310
04:52:55,320 --> 04:52:58,020
discussions on making sure that

5311
04:52:58,020 --> 04:53:00,000
um you know there's loopholes being

5312
04:53:00,000 --> 04:53:01,740
closed there too

5313
04:53:01,740 --> 04:53:04,020
um but then you know that there's ways

5314
04:53:04,020 --> 04:53:06,540
of countering threat actors and that

5315
04:53:06,540 --> 04:53:08,580
systems that are affected in some way

5316
04:53:08,580 --> 04:53:11,340
can recover quickly and and then

5317
04:53:11,340 --> 04:53:14,458
incentivize as well those individuals

5318
04:53:14,458 --> 04:53:16,680
and entities that have strong systems

5319
04:53:16,680 --> 04:53:20,040
currently in some way shape or form

5320
04:53:20,040 --> 04:53:22,680
so those are things to look at I think

5321
04:53:22,680 --> 04:53:25,080
it's really interesting strategy and

5322
04:53:25,080 --> 04:53:27,060
really important because it kind of

5323
04:53:27,060 --> 04:53:29,820
shapes the landscape of policy and law

5324
04:53:29,820 --> 04:53:32,360
in this space

5325
04:53:33,298 --> 04:53:36,600
so this so what right like why why is

5326
04:53:36,600 --> 04:53:38,400
this important why is this discussion

5327
04:53:38,400 --> 04:53:40,860
why are focusing on all these different

5328
04:53:40,860 --> 04:53:43,378
laws and policies and things like that

5329
04:53:43,378 --> 04:53:46,560
important right and that is because lots

5330
04:53:46,560 --> 04:53:49,080
of legislation comes out from different

5331
04:53:49,080 --> 04:53:51,120
states and from the federal government

5332
04:53:51,120 --> 04:53:54,718
you know in 2022 you had 40 states that

5333
04:53:54,718 --> 04:53:58,260
introduced 250 bills in this space right

5334
04:53:58,260 --> 04:54:01,560
and only 24 were enacted but out of

5335
04:54:01,560 --> 04:54:04,020
those 24 things can get really confusing

5336
04:54:04,020 --> 04:54:07,320
right in the 117 Congress which has

5337
04:54:07,320 --> 04:54:09,120
passed right now it ended like mid

5338
04:54:09,120 --> 04:54:13,080
January I think there were 498 bills

5339
04:54:13,080 --> 04:54:14,760
related to cyber security that were

5340
04:54:14,760 --> 04:54:18,780
introduced only 13 passed but most came

5341
04:54:18,780 --> 04:54:21,298
from executive orders so most of the

5342
04:54:21,298 --> 04:54:23,940
action in the space was coming from

5343
04:54:23,940 --> 04:54:26,638
President Biden's executive orders so

5344
04:54:26,638 --> 04:54:29,580
but even with those 12 again things get

5345
04:54:29,580 --> 04:54:32,700
complicated things get dicey and that's

5346
04:54:32,700 --> 04:54:34,560
why you sometimes have the low lawyers

5347
04:54:34,560 --> 04:54:36,540
in the room when it comes to the space

5348
04:54:36,540 --> 04:54:39,060
that you may be in to understand and

5349
04:54:39,060 --> 04:54:41,100
help interpret what's going on in this

5350
04:54:41,100 --> 04:54:41,940
space

5351
04:54:41,940 --> 04:54:44,458
and then also because we have to

5352
04:54:44,458 --> 04:54:46,740
consider all the new and improved

5353
04:54:46,740 --> 04:54:48,120
technology that's coming from out there

5354
04:54:48,120 --> 04:54:50,700
and um you might think oh well you know

5355
04:54:50,700 --> 04:54:52,440
we've been talking about AI for a long

5356
04:54:52,440 --> 04:54:53,520
time we've been talking about Cloud

5357
04:54:53,520 --> 04:54:55,440
technology for a long time

5358
04:54:55,440 --> 04:54:57,240
et cetera et cetera but in this space

5359
04:54:57,240 --> 04:54:59,340
there's new things that come up every

5360
04:54:59,340 --> 04:55:01,680
single day for example like I mentioned

5361
04:55:01,680 --> 04:55:03,718
in the first hypothetical and I think I

5362
04:55:03,718 --> 04:55:05,400
could talk about this

5363
04:55:05,400 --> 04:55:07,560
um there is the ban of starting

5364
04:55:07,560 --> 04:55:09,240
equipment right like certain companies

5365
04:55:09,240 --> 04:55:11,878
are a No-No and that's public right it's

5366
04:55:11,878 --> 04:55:13,500
public for everyone to see under the

5367
04:55:13,500 --> 04:55:15,180
fcc's website

5368
04:55:15,180 --> 04:55:18,420
but those equipment sometimes can come

5369
04:55:18,420 --> 04:55:21,718
through in some other way right they can

5370
04:55:21,718 --> 04:55:24,000
be sold through another procedure and

5371
04:55:24,000 --> 04:55:25,260
you may not know or they may be

5372
04:55:25,260 --> 04:55:27,120
incorporated into another equipment and

5373
04:55:27,120 --> 04:55:28,860
you may not know that it's being

5374
04:55:28,860 --> 04:55:30,780
Incorporated within the major equipment

5375
04:55:30,780 --> 04:55:33,718
itself that's a new issue no one thought

5376
04:55:33,718 --> 04:55:35,700
about that right you're like what do you

5377
04:55:35,700 --> 04:55:37,260
mean you didn't think about that how

5378
04:55:37,260 --> 04:55:39,120
does people want to think about that so

5379
04:55:39,120 --> 04:55:41,218
what happens now right like what do I do

5380
04:55:41,218 --> 04:55:43,200
how do you address this issue and so

5381
04:55:43,200 --> 04:55:45,600
that's where Avi um people in the room

5382
04:55:45,600 --> 04:55:47,940
in this space come and talk together and

5383
04:55:47,940 --> 04:55:50,340
see it figure out what's legally allowed

5384
04:55:50,340 --> 04:55:52,440
to be done and what do we do on a policy

5385
04:55:52,440 --> 04:55:54,420
level as well right so those type of

5386
04:55:54,420 --> 04:55:56,100
things happen every day in this space

5387
04:55:56,100 --> 04:55:58,920
but then you also have like new things

5388
04:55:58,920 --> 04:56:00,900
that are happening like chat gbt again

5389
04:56:00,900 --> 04:56:02,940
lots of conversations about that the

5390
04:56:02,940 --> 04:56:04,760
risk that can happen from that

5391
04:56:04,760 --> 04:56:07,680
Biometrics the government collects a lot

5392
04:56:07,680 --> 04:56:10,020
of biometric data but other companies do

5393
04:56:10,020 --> 04:56:12,060
too and there have been a lot of states

5394
04:56:12,060 --> 04:56:14,820
banning Ai and banning the use of

5395
04:56:14,820 --> 04:56:16,500
Biometrics right like I think there was

5396
04:56:16,500 --> 04:56:19,138
one article talking about concert venues

5397
04:56:19,138 --> 04:56:21,660
hockey games those types of

5398
04:56:21,660 --> 04:56:23,520
entertainment venues collecting

5399
04:56:23,520 --> 04:56:25,860
biometric data and how the government

5400
04:56:25,860 --> 04:56:28,138
wants to consider like not allowing

5401
04:56:28,138 --> 04:56:30,120
companies to do that right or you know

5402
04:56:30,120 --> 04:56:32,218
Banning sort of this biometric

5403
04:56:32,218 --> 04:56:34,320
collection of data because they think it

5404
04:56:34,320 --> 04:56:36,060
violates privacy

5405
04:56:36,060 --> 04:56:39,360
then you have the metaverse right I mean

5406
04:56:39,360 --> 04:56:40,680
people are like oh well what's the

5407
04:56:40,680 --> 04:56:43,920
metaverse I mean it's really new and you

5408
04:56:43,920 --> 04:56:45,480
know there's lots of things here and

5409
04:56:45,480 --> 04:56:47,218
there it's very fickly right but at the

5410
04:56:47,218 --> 04:56:48,600
same time there's a lot of issues that

5411
04:56:48,600 --> 04:56:51,240
can come from that and you'll again the

5412
04:56:51,240 --> 04:56:53,340
same conversation you have meta and you

5413
04:56:53,340 --> 04:56:55,680
have all the major companies at the top

5414
04:56:55,680 --> 04:56:58,860
trying to get into this space and sort

5415
04:56:58,860 --> 04:57:00,718
of monopolize in this space so what

5416
04:57:00,718 --> 04:57:02,280
happens when they do that and what

5417
04:57:02,280 --> 04:57:04,560
happens when it expands more what are

5418
04:57:04,560 --> 04:57:05,940
the issues there so we have to think

5419
04:57:05,940 --> 04:57:07,920
about those type of things too

5420
04:57:07,920 --> 04:57:10,020
and The Internet of Things even though

5421
04:57:10,020 --> 04:57:12,600
that's always been around for a while

5422
04:57:12,600 --> 04:57:14,940
right at the same time you still have

5423
04:57:14,940 --> 04:57:16,860
issues happening in that space the

5424
04:57:16,860 --> 04:57:18,900
vulnerability of those equipment but the

5425
04:57:18,900 --> 04:57:21,240
everyday use of that equipment from

5426
04:57:21,240 --> 04:57:23,458
people right my fit you know my Apple

5427
04:57:23,458 --> 04:57:25,920
watch the Fitbit Etc like all those

5428
04:57:25,920 --> 04:57:28,138
things are still in talks and still

5429
04:57:28,138 --> 04:57:32,899
discussed in this policy legal landscape

5430
04:57:33,840 --> 04:57:37,680
so I wanted to quickly focus on critical

5431
04:57:37,680 --> 04:57:39,060
infrastructure right you're like what

5432
04:57:39,060 --> 04:57:41,400
does that mean and for those who do know

5433
04:57:41,400 --> 04:57:43,020
what that means I apologize but just

5434
04:57:43,020 --> 04:57:45,298
really wanted to focus on that

5435
04:57:45,298 --> 04:57:48,298
um here you have only like the 10 or so

5436
04:57:48,298 --> 04:57:50,878
that I that I usually come across a lot

5437
04:57:50,878 --> 04:57:53,100
within DHS but there's like 16 in total

5438
04:57:53,100 --> 04:57:55,440
that cisa and DHS are supposed to be

5439
04:57:55,440 --> 04:57:58,440
protecting right each of these sectors

5440
04:57:58,440 --> 04:58:01,080
are so important in cyber and some

5441
04:58:01,080 --> 04:58:03,600
people are like well what does the

5442
04:58:03,600 --> 04:58:05,340
energy well not necessary energy but

5443
04:58:05,340 --> 04:58:07,560
let's say water right what does water

5444
04:58:07,560 --> 04:58:10,740
have to do with this right a lot there

5445
04:58:10,740 --> 04:58:13,500
was one hack in Florida that happened or

5446
04:58:13,500 --> 04:58:15,660
at least attempted to happen and it

5447
04:58:15,660 --> 04:58:18,298
could have caused a lot of damage right

5448
04:58:18,298 --> 04:58:19,920
um it could have depending on who that

5449
04:58:19,920 --> 04:58:21,660
hacker was if it's a foreign adversary

5450
04:58:21,660 --> 04:58:24,240
they can put some you know figure out a

5451
04:58:24,240 --> 04:58:26,100
way to get into that system and do

5452
04:58:26,100 --> 04:58:28,378
something bad and affect many citizens

5453
04:58:28,378 --> 04:58:29,340
right

5454
04:58:29,340 --> 04:58:32,100
energy sector right you know our plants

5455
04:58:32,100 --> 04:58:34,798
chemical plants you know our voting

5456
04:58:34,798 --> 04:58:37,138
systems health care right hospitals

5457
04:58:37,138 --> 04:58:39,780
being breached and causing lots of havoc

5458
04:58:39,780 --> 04:58:41,100
and killing people at the same time

5459
04:58:41,100 --> 04:58:43,980
right like that's all important and a

5460
04:58:43,980 --> 04:58:45,360
lot of people that don't understand the

5461
04:58:45,360 --> 04:58:46,860
space sometimes are like well I don't

5462
04:58:46,860 --> 04:58:48,600
understand how it's going to affect you

5463
04:58:48,600 --> 04:58:50,520
know the electricity grid what does it

5464
04:58:50,520 --> 04:58:52,680
have to do with National Security a lot

5465
04:58:52,680 --> 04:58:54,958
right and I think that they just don't

5466
04:58:54,958 --> 04:58:57,480
see a lot of what happens every day

5467
04:58:57,480 --> 04:58:59,700
because they just get the stories that

5468
04:58:59,700 --> 04:59:01,320
they see which are like once every

5469
04:59:01,320 --> 04:59:04,200
couple of months right so that's why you

5470
04:59:04,200 --> 04:59:07,378
know at DHS and just in general I was

5471
04:59:07,378 --> 04:59:09,660
this is why it's so important to be in

5472
04:59:09,660 --> 04:59:10,980
this space and talking about law and

5473
04:59:10,980 --> 04:59:12,600
policy because we're trying to protect

5474
04:59:12,600 --> 04:59:14,878
all these structures infrastructures

5475
04:59:14,878 --> 04:59:17,120
here

5476
04:59:18,360 --> 04:59:21,240
so now quickly I wanted to kind of focus

5477
04:59:21,240 --> 04:59:23,878
on like sort of these like certain

5478
04:59:23,878 --> 04:59:26,700
spaces within law and policy with

5479
04:59:26,700 --> 04:59:28,378
regards to cyber security and one of

5480
04:59:28,378 --> 04:59:30,540
them is data breaches right

5481
04:59:30,540 --> 04:59:32,760
and what is the important takeaways from

5482
04:59:32,760 --> 04:59:34,980
this in this space well companies have

5483
04:59:34,980 --> 04:59:37,740
an obligation to inform of major data

5484
04:59:37,740 --> 04:59:39,060
breaches

5485
04:59:39,060 --> 04:59:41,100
um pursuant to state law right like so

5486
04:59:41,100 --> 04:59:44,700
your state might require you to inform

5487
04:59:44,700 --> 04:59:46,798
them or inform in some way whatever that

5488
04:59:46,798 --> 04:59:48,180
process may be

5489
04:59:48,180 --> 04:59:51,060
especially if you are a public company

5490
04:59:51,060 --> 04:59:53,458
and you have shareholders you have a

5491
04:59:53,458 --> 04:59:55,378
board of directors you have an

5492
04:59:55,378 --> 04:59:57,958
obligation to be truthful at all times

5493
04:59:57,958 --> 05:00:00,298
especially if it affects their pockets

5494
05:00:00,298 --> 05:00:04,080
that is a rule right the SEC or the

5495
05:00:04,080 --> 05:00:05,820
Securities Exchange Commission they're

5496
05:00:05,820 --> 05:00:07,500
considering and they have been talking

5497
05:00:07,500 --> 05:00:10,860
about this for a while is requiring the

5498
05:00:10,860 --> 05:00:13,260
obligation to inform about major data

5499
05:00:13,260 --> 05:00:14,700
breaches when it comes to public

5500
05:00:14,700 --> 05:00:17,520
companies and how will that affect the

5501
05:00:17,520 --> 05:00:19,378
company itself how would it affect you

5502
05:00:19,378 --> 05:00:22,080
and your positions what's the liability

5503
05:00:22,080 --> 05:00:24,360
there and how much money is it going to

5504
05:00:24,360 --> 05:00:25,680
affect the company right because that's

5505
05:00:25,680 --> 05:00:29,940
the major bottom line is money right so

5506
05:00:29,940 --> 05:00:31,680
um there is always some kind of

5507
05:00:31,680 --> 05:00:34,680
obligation in some way now federally

5508
05:00:34,680 --> 05:00:37,860
there might not be an obligation from a

5509
05:00:37,860 --> 05:00:40,260
company to inform about data breach but

5510
05:00:40,260 --> 05:00:41,958
again we try to create that

5511
05:00:41,958 --> 05:00:44,280
public-private partnership and in

5512
05:00:44,280 --> 05:00:46,980
exchange we try to make sure that we can

5513
05:00:46,980 --> 05:00:48,480
collect some of the evidence that's

5514
05:00:48,480 --> 05:00:51,360
happening there and try to have what

5515
05:00:51,360 --> 05:00:52,920
quote-unquote your back on certain

5516
05:00:52,920 --> 05:00:54,000
things right like there's certain things

5517
05:00:54,000 --> 05:00:55,860
the government can't do but you know

5518
05:00:55,860 --> 05:00:58,020
just making sure that we can

5519
05:00:58,020 --> 05:01:00,060
um calm the the incident that's

5520
05:01:00,060 --> 05:01:01,860
happening there

5521
05:01:01,860 --> 05:01:04,560
and it is suggested that companies share

5522
05:01:04,560 --> 05:01:06,480
breaches with federal government so that

5523
05:01:06,480 --> 05:01:08,160
there may be much more protection and

5524
05:01:08,160 --> 05:01:09,840
more opportunity in the long run later

5525
05:01:09,840 --> 05:01:11,280
on

5526
05:01:11,280 --> 05:01:13,798
some important policy and law in this

5527
05:01:13,798 --> 05:01:17,280
space right you had ppd41 which is the

5528
05:01:17,280 --> 05:01:18,900
presidential policy directive that's

5529
05:01:18,900 --> 05:01:21,980
just another fancy word for policy right

5530
05:01:21,980 --> 05:01:24,958
that looks at United States cyber

5531
05:01:24,958 --> 05:01:27,000
incident coordination and that's

5532
05:01:27,000 --> 05:01:30,660
important because sometimes the federal

5533
05:01:30,660 --> 05:01:31,820
government doesn't get it right right

5534
05:01:31,820 --> 05:01:35,458
most of the time and so they sometimes

5535
05:01:35,458 --> 05:01:39,840
don't understand what to do if there's a

5536
05:01:39,840 --> 05:01:42,298
data breach you have many agencies that

5537
05:01:42,298 --> 05:01:44,580
try to come together and they're like oh

5538
05:01:44,580 --> 05:01:46,620
this is my thing or this is my thing and

5539
05:01:46,620 --> 05:01:49,920
it creates a lot of conflict right so

5540
05:01:49,920 --> 05:01:53,100
this PPD or policy here is trying to

5541
05:01:53,100 --> 05:01:55,138
make sure that we create a streamlined

5542
05:01:55,138 --> 05:01:56,218
process

5543
05:01:56,218 --> 05:01:59,458
so it better helps the person that's

5544
05:01:59,458 --> 05:02:01,560
reporting the breach in the long run and

5545
05:02:01,560 --> 05:02:04,940
it doesn't create conflict

5546
05:02:05,218 --> 05:02:06,840
so a

5547
05:02:06,840 --> 05:02:09,000
security safety review board that was

5548
05:02:09,000 --> 05:02:11,280
created not too long ago which is under

5549
05:02:11,280 --> 05:02:15,660
DHS and they are there to basically

5550
05:02:15,660 --> 05:02:18,900
review certain breaches that happen in

5551
05:02:18,900 --> 05:02:21,360
public companies or private companies or

5552
05:02:21,360 --> 05:02:22,740
private sector

5553
05:02:22,740 --> 05:02:25,500
and the vet board is composed of

5554
05:02:25,500 --> 05:02:28,920
different privacy on private leaders and

5555
05:02:28,920 --> 05:02:30,718
then government leaders they come

5556
05:02:30,718 --> 05:02:32,400
together and I think the latest report

5557
05:02:32,400 --> 05:02:34,680
that they issued was the incident of log

5558
05:02:34,680 --> 05:02:37,378
4J right and what happened there what

5559
05:02:37,378 --> 05:02:39,420
can we learn from it what's the next

5560
05:02:39,420 --> 05:02:41,700
steps for companies in this space so

5561
05:02:41,700 --> 05:02:43,458
those are two of the major things there

5562
05:02:43,458 --> 05:02:46,200
legal case right and this is what I was

5563
05:02:46,200 --> 05:02:49,260
referring to at the beginning

5564
05:02:49,260 --> 05:02:51,540
um if you don't protect I mean excuse me

5565
05:02:51,540 --> 05:02:54,240
if you don't disclose a data breach and

5566
05:02:54,240 --> 05:02:58,200
you are intently deceiving the company

5567
05:02:58,200 --> 05:03:00,540
and your CEO and you just want to make

5568
05:03:00,540 --> 05:03:01,920
it go away

5569
05:03:01,920 --> 05:03:03,480
please don't do that because you get

5570
05:03:03,480 --> 05:03:06,718
arrested and you can serve time and this

5571
05:03:06,718 --> 05:03:10,740
is what happened to the ciso of uber and

5572
05:03:10,740 --> 05:03:13,260
he back in 2016 there was a major data

5573
05:03:13,260 --> 05:03:16,440
breach he did not want to disclose it he

5574
05:03:16,440 --> 05:03:18,780
told the CEO I took care of it there's

5575
05:03:18,780 --> 05:03:21,660
nothing that happened you know he just

5576
05:03:21,660 --> 05:03:24,298
covered it up in some way and then what

5577
05:03:24,298 --> 05:03:25,920
happened was that he was charged

5578
05:03:25,920 --> 05:03:28,740
federally now this is like the first

5579
05:03:28,740 --> 05:03:31,500
time this really happens right and there

5580
05:03:31,500 --> 05:03:33,120
was a lot of conversations about this

5581
05:03:33,120 --> 05:03:34,320
like well what's going to happen in

5582
05:03:34,320 --> 05:03:36,660
future cisos or people that are put in

5583
05:03:36,660 --> 05:03:39,420
this position that are considered Chief

5584
05:03:39,420 --> 05:03:41,458
right security officers but in reality

5585
05:03:41,458 --> 05:03:44,520
it's just like a term and you're used as

5586
05:03:44,520 --> 05:03:47,280
a scapegoat for these situations or what

5587
05:03:47,280 --> 05:03:49,080
happens if you contract that out to

5588
05:03:49,080 --> 05:03:51,540
other third-party companies what's the

5589
05:03:51,540 --> 05:03:53,638
liability there there's a lot of open

5590
05:03:53,638 --> 05:03:56,040
Dialogue on this and this is where the

5591
05:03:56,040 --> 05:03:58,200
whole issue of Law and policy come in

5592
05:03:58,200 --> 05:04:01,200
and you know having those unknown

5593
05:04:01,200 --> 05:04:02,940
factors happen in a space that you're

5594
05:04:02,940 --> 05:04:04,440
like well data breaches that's pretty

5595
05:04:04,440 --> 05:04:06,360
you know up forward front you know

5596
05:04:06,360 --> 05:04:08,340
they're we settled on this right not

5597
05:04:08,340 --> 05:04:10,020
really now there's this open question

5598
05:04:10,020 --> 05:04:12,900
here so one thing that I want to focus

5599
05:04:12,900 --> 05:04:14,820
on because I think it's really important

5600
05:04:14,820 --> 05:04:18,798
it was a recent issue that happened

5601
05:04:19,260 --> 05:04:22,020
then we have global data transfers and

5602
05:04:22,020 --> 05:04:24,180
law enforcement requests and what does

5603
05:04:24,180 --> 05:04:26,580
this mean so I don't know if anyone's

5604
05:04:26,580 --> 05:04:29,580
familiar with the shrem situation or if

5605
05:04:29,580 --> 05:04:31,320
you follow policy well

5606
05:04:31,320 --> 05:04:34,740
if you are a company that does business

5607
05:04:34,740 --> 05:04:38,100
with European companies you have to

5608
05:04:38,100 --> 05:04:40,560
follow certain steps because European

5609
05:04:40,560 --> 05:04:42,718
companies under the general data

5610
05:04:42,718 --> 05:04:45,360
protection regulation look at privacy in

5611
05:04:45,360 --> 05:04:47,160
a different way than U.S companies or

5612
05:04:47,160 --> 05:04:49,080
U.S in general

5613
05:04:49,080 --> 05:04:52,080
they have more extra protections than us

5614
05:04:52,080 --> 05:04:53,940
right we don't have a federal Privacy

5615
05:04:53,940 --> 05:04:56,218
Law so we have different states that

5616
05:04:56,218 --> 05:04:58,200
have different you know standards or

5617
05:04:58,200 --> 05:05:01,138
laws but generally or collectively we

5618
05:05:01,138 --> 05:05:02,400
don't have that

5619
05:05:02,400 --> 05:05:04,920
so it's really hard sometimes for

5620
05:05:04,920 --> 05:05:08,160
companies that do business overseas to

5621
05:05:08,160 --> 05:05:10,378
sort of transact with each other because

5622
05:05:10,378 --> 05:05:12,718
then you could violate their laws or

5623
05:05:12,718 --> 05:05:15,660
their gdpr violations right and that

5624
05:05:15,660 --> 05:05:19,020
carries big fines big money so I think

5625
05:05:19,020 --> 05:05:22,080
Facebook or meta now was find a lot of

5626
05:05:22,080 --> 05:05:23,940
money for it in this space

5627
05:05:23,940 --> 05:05:25,798
so that's why it's really important to

5628
05:05:25,798 --> 05:05:28,080
like understand what this is in a

5629
05:05:28,080 --> 05:05:30,120
nutshell right and the only reason why

5630
05:05:30,120 --> 05:05:32,420
it's become even bigger thing is because

5631
05:05:32,420 --> 05:05:35,700
back then or at least in some way there

5632
05:05:35,700 --> 05:05:37,798
was a privacy Shield so the Department

5633
05:05:37,798 --> 05:05:41,400
of Commerce was the person or the agency

5634
05:05:41,400 --> 05:05:44,218
responsible for handling this sort of

5635
05:05:44,218 --> 05:05:45,958
back and forth of you know having you

5636
05:05:45,958 --> 05:05:47,580
know transacting with businesses in the

5637
05:05:47,580 --> 05:05:50,580
in European union and in the US right

5638
05:05:50,580 --> 05:05:52,860
and so there was a thing called privacy

5639
05:05:52,860 --> 05:05:55,378
Shield where if your company signed up

5640
05:05:55,378 --> 05:05:57,600
and you know there was like a whole

5641
05:05:57,600 --> 05:05:59,040
thing that you had to do

5642
05:05:59,040 --> 05:06:01,260
you're kind of you know directed and

5643
05:06:01,260 --> 05:06:03,718
advised by Commerce and these groups of

5644
05:06:03,718 --> 05:06:06,060
people within the Privacy shield and

5645
05:06:06,060 --> 05:06:08,520
helping you sort of transact one you

5646
05:06:08,520 --> 05:06:10,980
know with the other companies in Europe

5647
05:06:10,980 --> 05:06:12,900
but then you had this case and that's

5648
05:06:12,900 --> 05:06:14,878
where I had the law here

5649
05:06:14,878 --> 05:06:16,798
um you had this case by this guy named

5650
05:06:16,798 --> 05:06:19,560
Max drums who's an Australian Advocate

5651
05:06:19,560 --> 05:06:22,980
privacy person who said absolutely not

5652
05:06:22,980 --> 05:06:26,520
the US is so shady that you can't trust

5653
05:06:26,520 --> 05:06:29,760
them with our European data and why is

5654
05:06:29,760 --> 05:06:31,560
that well because we have something

5655
05:06:31,560 --> 05:06:35,280
called fisa section 702 that is actually

5656
05:06:35,280 --> 05:06:37,860
going to expire soon that came out of 9

5657
05:06:37,860 --> 05:06:40,980
11 and the Patriot Act and basically

5658
05:06:40,980 --> 05:06:43,860
there are certain safeguards there but

5659
05:06:43,860 --> 05:06:47,218
we can collect certain information from

5660
05:06:47,218 --> 05:06:50,520
you know companies like Google Microsoft

5661
05:06:50,520 --> 05:06:52,260
Etc when it comes to National Security

5662
05:06:52,260 --> 05:06:54,900
issues and there's certain things that

5663
05:06:54,900 --> 05:06:56,878
are brought there with regards to

5664
05:06:56,878 --> 05:06:59,280
collecting this information and that's

5665
05:06:59,280 --> 05:07:01,080
where law enforcement requests come in

5666
05:07:01,080 --> 05:07:03,718
too and so

5667
05:07:03,718 --> 05:07:08,760
um the max schremes guy filed a case in

5668
05:07:08,760 --> 05:07:10,680
the European courts

5669
05:07:10,680 --> 05:07:13,440
and he won and he's and they decided

5670
05:07:13,440 --> 05:07:16,458
that we don't have the proper adequacy

5671
05:07:16,458 --> 05:07:19,378
protections of privacy for their

5672
05:07:19,378 --> 05:07:21,480
citizens so now we've been going back

5673
05:07:21,480 --> 05:07:23,940
and forth there's been a new executive

5674
05:07:23,940 --> 05:07:26,700
order by Biden where it creates like a

5675
05:07:26,700 --> 05:07:28,798
whole new system for making sure that we

5676
05:07:28,798 --> 05:07:31,080
protect you know privacy and but then

5677
05:07:31,080 --> 05:07:32,700
balance it with National Security and

5678
05:07:32,700 --> 05:07:35,040
our collections signals intelligence

5679
05:07:35,040 --> 05:07:36,240
data

5680
05:07:36,240 --> 05:07:39,060
but of course he's you know Max has just

5681
05:07:39,060 --> 05:07:41,280
said he's going to keep filing cases

5682
05:07:41,280 --> 05:07:44,400
until we like get it right I guess so

5683
05:07:44,400 --> 05:07:46,798
this is just something for you to be

5684
05:07:46,798 --> 05:07:49,200
aware of because companies you know

5685
05:07:49,200 --> 05:07:51,480
especially tech companies and

5686
05:07:51,480 --> 05:07:53,638
um our technology comes very Global and

5687
05:07:53,638 --> 05:07:55,200
so we're always going to transact with

5688
05:07:55,200 --> 05:07:57,000
European companies right like that's

5689
05:07:57,000 --> 05:07:59,340
where a lot of business comes from so

5690
05:07:59,340 --> 05:08:00,958
that's why it's so important to

5691
05:08:00,958 --> 05:08:06,060
understand what this means for the space

5692
05:08:06,060 --> 05:08:09,120
and then also law enforcement so there's

5693
05:08:09,120 --> 05:08:10,740
something called national security

5694
05:08:10,740 --> 05:08:12,860
letters or

5695
05:08:12,860 --> 05:08:15,240
nsls or there's other names out there

5696
05:08:15,240 --> 05:08:19,740
but basically FBI and our federal

5697
05:08:19,740 --> 05:08:22,500
agencies can sometimes collect or

5698
05:08:22,500 --> 05:08:24,180
require companies to give up some

5699
05:08:24,180 --> 05:08:26,340
information under this National Security

5700
05:08:26,340 --> 05:08:28,200
letter without a fourth amendment

5701
05:08:28,200 --> 05:08:30,780
warrant so you have to go through some

5702
05:08:30,780 --> 05:08:34,200
hoops et cetera et cetera but there are

5703
05:08:34,200 --> 05:08:36,060
requests that are made and there's tons

5704
05:08:36,060 --> 05:08:39,298
of them that happen every year so

5705
05:08:39,298 --> 05:08:40,620
um you know there's public information

5706
05:08:40,620 --> 05:08:42,840
out there about this it just does not

5707
05:08:42,840 --> 05:08:45,180
secret or anything like that but it's

5708
05:08:45,180 --> 05:08:46,560
something to look out for and understand

5709
05:08:46,560 --> 05:08:49,320
because they can come to your companies

5710
05:08:49,320 --> 05:08:50,820
and say hey we need people's email

5711
05:08:50,820 --> 05:08:52,980
addresses or we need the following

5712
05:08:52,980 --> 05:08:55,740
individuals and this is why so things to

5713
05:08:55,740 --> 05:08:58,878
look out for there

5714
05:08:59,240 --> 05:09:02,820
then we have our products and vendors

5715
05:09:02,820 --> 05:09:04,500
section right and this is kind of going

5716
05:09:04,500 --> 05:09:06,840
back to the first hypothetical

5717
05:09:06,840 --> 05:09:09,000
so what does this mean if you are a

5718
05:09:09,000 --> 05:09:12,120
certain telecommunications company or um

5719
05:09:12,120 --> 05:09:14,520
you know company that does you know

5720
05:09:14,520 --> 05:09:17,458
certain networking you know routing data

5721
05:09:17,458 --> 05:09:21,298
back and forth user traffic Etc

5722
05:09:21,298 --> 05:09:22,860
um there's certain things that are

5723
05:09:22,860 --> 05:09:25,260
banned from you using certain equipment

5724
05:09:25,260 --> 05:09:28,020
from certain companies and things like

5725
05:09:28,020 --> 05:09:29,820
the secure and trusted Communications

5726
05:09:29,820 --> 05:09:32,540
act as one under the FCC

5727
05:09:32,540 --> 05:09:35,940
there is now supply chain legislation

5728
05:09:35,940 --> 05:09:38,700
talking about banning certain companies

5729
05:09:38,700 --> 05:09:41,700
that are not good for supply chain in

5730
05:09:41,700 --> 05:09:43,020
the U.S because of National Security

5731
05:09:43,020 --> 05:09:46,440
risks and things like for example not

5732
05:09:46,440 --> 05:09:47,340
just

5733
05:09:47,340 --> 05:09:49,080
um you know networking equipment but

5734
05:09:49,080 --> 05:09:50,940
also like security cameras right

5735
05:09:50,940 --> 05:09:53,878
especially if your companies have a lot

5736
05:09:53,878 --> 05:09:56,458
of government contracts right

5737
05:09:56,458 --> 05:09:58,378
and then Federal Acquisitions Security

5738
05:09:58,378 --> 05:10:00,298
Council is another one who basically

5739
05:10:00,298 --> 05:10:04,200
convenes under the White House and they

5740
05:10:04,200 --> 05:10:06,240
basically manage government contracts

5741
05:10:06,240 --> 05:10:07,980
and those type of vendors there

5742
05:10:07,980 --> 05:10:09,840
especially with regards to their

5743
05:10:09,840 --> 05:10:11,100
Networks

5744
05:10:11,100 --> 05:10:12,420
well this is why it's important to

5745
05:10:12,420 --> 05:10:14,638
understand this section because if you

5746
05:10:14,638 --> 05:10:16,980
are in charge of you know Contracting

5747
05:10:16,980 --> 05:10:20,760
out equipment or purchasing or just the

5748
05:10:20,760 --> 05:10:22,920
way that you build the networks there's

5749
05:10:22,920 --> 05:10:25,798
certain things that are a No-No of

5750
05:10:25,798 --> 05:10:27,060
companies

5751
05:10:27,060 --> 05:10:29,280
and then there's other issues that are

5752
05:10:29,280 --> 05:10:30,840
considering in this space like for

5753
05:10:30,840 --> 05:10:32,940
example the chips act which basically

5754
05:10:32,940 --> 05:10:36,480
promotes say my conductor businesses and

5755
05:10:36,480 --> 05:10:38,760
making sure that we can try to find a

5756
05:10:38,760 --> 05:10:40,378
way to just

5757
05:10:40,378 --> 05:10:42,480
um have semiconductor capabilities here

5758
05:10:42,480 --> 05:10:45,180
in the US and not just be it be all

5759
05:10:45,180 --> 05:10:47,638
Central in certain parts of the world

5760
05:10:47,638 --> 05:10:48,780
right

5761
05:10:48,780 --> 05:10:51,660
um and so we're trying to promote that

5762
05:10:51,660 --> 05:10:53,878
Commerce side of things

5763
05:10:53,878 --> 05:10:55,860
um and then government contracts if

5764
05:10:55,860 --> 05:10:58,320
companies are doing or you know

5765
05:10:58,320 --> 05:11:00,480
transacting with governments or with the

5766
05:11:00,480 --> 05:11:03,298
US government making sure that you're

5767
05:11:03,298 --> 05:11:05,520
following those rules there especially

5768
05:11:05,520 --> 05:11:08,340
if you have business with DOD or things

5769
05:11:08,340 --> 05:11:09,540
like that

5770
05:11:09,540 --> 05:11:12,000
and then software development there's a

5771
05:11:12,000 --> 05:11:14,280
lot of talks about if you are building

5772
05:11:14,280 --> 05:11:17,638
software that there's certain you know

5773
05:11:17,638 --> 05:11:19,620
rules and certain things that you're

5774
05:11:19,620 --> 05:11:21,900
abiding by because there might be

5775
05:11:21,900 --> 05:11:24,000
certain legislation in the pipeline with

5776
05:11:24,000 --> 05:11:28,940
regards to risks in that space too

5777
05:11:29,638 --> 05:11:31,798
all right and then Network

5778
05:11:31,798 --> 05:11:34,080
infrastructure development

5779
05:11:34,080 --> 05:11:37,320
um this is another big space because of

5780
05:11:37,320 --> 05:11:39,718
zero trust right zero trust is not a new

5781
05:11:39,718 --> 05:11:41,940
thing but it became a new thing

5782
05:11:41,940 --> 05:11:44,580
quote-unquote when uh President Biden

5783
05:11:44,580 --> 05:11:46,560
released his executive order on

5784
05:11:46,560 --> 05:11:49,980
improving cyber security right but also

5785
05:11:49,980 --> 05:11:52,860
because we have seen a lot of

5786
05:11:52,860 --> 05:11:55,260
conversations regarding smart cities and

5787
05:11:55,260 --> 05:11:58,740
you know developing 5G and all these

5788
05:11:58,740 --> 05:12:02,638
other big futuristic type of you know

5789
05:12:02,638 --> 05:12:04,740
transaction of services for Citizens

5790
05:12:04,740 --> 05:12:07,260
this is why it's important to kind of

5791
05:12:07,260 --> 05:12:09,840
understand this area because of the fact

5792
05:12:09,840 --> 05:12:13,080
that we're focusing on the critical you

5793
05:12:13,080 --> 05:12:14,700
know infrastructures and regulating

5794
05:12:14,700 --> 05:12:17,780
those spaces there

5795
05:12:19,620 --> 05:12:22,500
and then lastly what I kind of focus on

5796
05:12:22,500 --> 05:12:24,120
in my work is foreign investment

5797
05:12:24,120 --> 05:12:26,940
technology right so we have these

5798
05:12:26,940 --> 05:12:29,840
stand-up committees that look at our

5799
05:12:29,840 --> 05:12:33,840
incoming transactions in the you know in

5800
05:12:33,840 --> 05:12:35,520
in the space of anything that has to do

5801
05:12:35,520 --> 05:12:37,980
with like technology data critical

5802
05:12:37,980 --> 05:12:40,138
infrastructure and we're just making

5803
05:12:40,138 --> 05:12:42,320
sure that if there is a foreign company

5804
05:12:42,320 --> 05:12:47,160
or a foreign country that is trying to

5805
05:12:47,160 --> 05:12:49,860
have a stake in our U.S company in

5806
05:12:49,860 --> 05:12:52,020
regards to this space right we're

5807
05:12:52,020 --> 05:12:54,360
reviewing threat risks there we're

5808
05:12:54,360 --> 05:12:57,718
reviewing how does that look like in our

5809
05:12:57,718 --> 05:12:59,100
country how does that look like in the

5810
05:12:59,100 --> 05:13:01,138
National Security space but there has to

5811
05:13:01,138 --> 05:13:03,060
be some kind of National Security risk

5812
05:13:03,060 --> 05:13:06,718
attached to that right we also look at

5813
05:13:06,718 --> 05:13:08,520
something you know like called team

5814
05:13:08,520 --> 05:13:10,798
Telecom which looks at submarine cables

5815
05:13:10,798 --> 05:13:14,400
looks at satellites and other networking

5816
05:13:14,400 --> 05:13:16,680
cables and networking Landing stations

5817
05:13:16,680 --> 05:13:20,040
and seeing if whether there is a law

5818
05:13:20,040 --> 05:13:22,440
enforcement risk or law enforcement

5819
05:13:22,440 --> 05:13:24,540
capability going on there in that cable

5820
05:13:24,540 --> 05:13:27,900
or Telecom ability in that company and

5821
05:13:27,900 --> 05:13:30,240
at the same time looking at whether a

5822
05:13:30,240 --> 05:13:33,840
foreign country or foreign sort of

5823
05:13:33,840 --> 05:13:35,820
company is trying to come in and look at

5824
05:13:35,820 --> 05:13:37,560
that space and take a share of that

5825
05:13:37,560 --> 05:13:40,020
company as well so

5826
05:13:40,020 --> 05:13:42,360
um that's why it's kind of just a you

5827
05:13:42,360 --> 05:13:43,020
know

5828
05:13:43,020 --> 05:13:44,820
you know wanted to provide this

5829
05:13:44,820 --> 05:13:46,378
background because I think it's really

5830
05:13:46,378 --> 05:13:48,600
important in this space because you

5831
05:13:48,600 --> 05:13:51,120
might hear these types of things and you

5832
05:13:51,120 --> 05:13:52,680
wherever you may work one day and you're

5833
05:13:52,680 --> 05:13:53,638
like well I don't know what you're

5834
05:13:53,638 --> 05:13:55,798
talking about so it's just good to have

5835
05:13:55,798 --> 05:13:58,620
like a knowledge of what does that mean

5836
05:13:58,620 --> 05:13:59,940
with regards to the federal government

5837
05:13:59,940 --> 05:14:03,240
and an investment in you know if one day

5838
05:14:03,240 --> 05:14:05,100
Uber or something like that comes in

5839
05:14:05,100 --> 05:14:05,878
right

5840
05:14:05,878 --> 05:14:09,600
so um that is for that section and I

5841
05:14:09,600 --> 05:14:10,680
think

5842
05:14:10,680 --> 05:14:14,340
I am done with my Spiel but I can open

5843
05:14:14,340 --> 05:14:16,200
it up for questions I know that I

5844
05:14:16,200 --> 05:14:19,080
probably provided a lot to you but I

5845
05:14:19,080 --> 05:14:23,180
welcome anything yes sir back there

5846
05:14:32,638 --> 05:14:35,160
yeah um good question

5847
05:14:35,160 --> 05:14:37,260
um the same thing that would happen

5848
05:14:37,260 --> 05:14:39,718
since they are critical infrastructure

5849
05:14:39,718 --> 05:14:41,100
um same thing if there was an investment

5850
05:14:41,100 --> 05:14:45,360
for example so agriculture or USDA is a

5851
05:14:45,360 --> 05:14:48,120
non-voting member of this space of

5852
05:14:48,120 --> 05:14:50,218
foreign investment Technology reviews so

5853
05:14:50,218 --> 05:14:52,980
if there is some kind of risk there or

5854
05:14:52,980 --> 05:14:54,600
if there's a foreign company or a

5855
05:14:54,600 --> 05:14:56,820
foreign country trying to look at that

5856
05:14:56,820 --> 05:14:58,260
space

5857
05:14:58,260 --> 05:15:00,180
um they are you called in to kind of

5858
05:15:00,180 --> 05:15:02,160
provide that expertise and to kind of

5859
05:15:02,160 --> 05:15:04,080
analyze that threat risk there because

5860
05:15:04,080 --> 05:15:06,298
that is important too and it is one of

5861
05:15:06,298 --> 05:15:08,280
the critical infrastructures and we tend

5862
05:15:08,280 --> 05:15:10,680
to look at that really closely too so

5863
05:15:10,680 --> 05:15:12,900
there's that space but other than that

5864
05:15:12,900 --> 05:15:15,540
it's mostly being kind of regulated

5865
05:15:15,540 --> 05:15:19,620
under this foreign investment space

5866
05:15:19,620 --> 05:15:23,059
any I think I saw one yes

5867
05:15:23,100 --> 05:15:25,100
yes

5868
05:15:50,400 --> 05:15:53,400
resistance

5869
05:16:06,718 --> 05:16:09,200
professional

5870
05:16:09,298 --> 05:16:13,878
avoid some of the political religions

5871
05:16:15,000 --> 05:16:16,980
yeah that's a good question and I

5872
05:16:16,980 --> 05:16:18,900
probably won't provide you any more

5873
05:16:18,900 --> 05:16:21,540
insight than you know doj is the one

5874
05:16:21,540 --> 05:16:23,638
that handles the Computer Fraud and

5875
05:16:23,638 --> 05:16:25,138
Abuse Act Right and they're always

5876
05:16:25,138 --> 05:16:27,958
issuing opinions or advisory opinions in

5877
05:16:27,958 --> 05:16:30,540
this space right and so I think that

5878
05:16:30,540 --> 05:16:33,660
that's something new in this area that I

5879
05:16:33,660 --> 05:16:35,100
don't think they've really like looked

5880
05:16:35,100 --> 05:16:37,320
at and unfortunately I don't have like a

5881
05:16:37,320 --> 05:16:40,260
concrete answer for you however it is

5882
05:16:40,260 --> 05:16:42,958
something that is sort of in this

5883
05:16:42,958 --> 05:16:44,458
landscape that we need to focus on

5884
05:16:44,458 --> 05:16:46,740
because I'm not too familiar with this

5885
05:16:46,740 --> 05:16:49,560
incident in Missouri but there is a lot

5886
05:16:49,560 --> 05:16:51,660
of talks back and forth about okay well

5887
05:16:51,660 --> 05:16:53,340
what happens if you're weaponizing or

5888
05:16:53,340 --> 05:16:55,320
utilizing this laws and regulation for

5889
05:16:55,320 --> 05:16:57,420
your own sort of political agendas or

5890
05:16:57,420 --> 05:17:00,180
sort of like how do we provide more

5891
05:17:00,180 --> 05:17:02,580
protections or less protections when it

5892
05:17:02,580 --> 05:17:05,400
comes to sharing or you know making sure

5893
05:17:05,400 --> 05:17:07,138
that we are providing like some kind of

5894
05:17:07,138 --> 05:17:09,600
boundaries so that we do have a better

5895
05:17:09,600 --> 05:17:11,780
partnership and I think that's what the

5896
05:17:11,780 --> 05:17:13,980
principles or the strategy that came out

5897
05:17:13,980 --> 05:17:16,138
kind of focus on without really like

5898
05:17:16,138 --> 05:17:19,500
saying this a specific topic right but

5899
05:17:19,500 --> 05:17:21,120
it's more of making sure that we provide

5900
05:17:21,120 --> 05:17:24,420
this balance because if we don't sort of

5901
05:17:24,420 --> 05:17:28,138
give some kind of trust Factor right to

5902
05:17:28,138 --> 05:17:30,958
our companies and to our private sector

5903
05:17:30,958 --> 05:17:32,820
um then how are we going to make sure

5904
05:17:32,820 --> 05:17:34,980
that they help us in the long run for

5905
05:17:34,980 --> 05:17:36,718
our goals and our mission right our

5906
05:17:36,718 --> 05:17:39,240
mission of whatever agency it might be

5907
05:17:39,240 --> 05:17:41,580
so that is a good question unfortunately

5908
05:17:41,580 --> 05:17:43,320
I don't have a concrete answer for that

5909
05:17:43,320 --> 05:17:46,320
but um there is always constantly like

5910
05:17:46,320 --> 05:17:48,900
talks about more advisory opinions in

5911
05:17:48,900 --> 05:17:51,600
this space especially the the cfaa and

5912
05:17:51,600 --> 05:17:53,940
making sure that we are not

5913
05:17:53,940 --> 05:17:56,160
um you know that we're we're answering

5914
05:17:56,160 --> 05:17:57,958
the loophole questions because that's an

5915
05:17:57,958 --> 05:17:59,760
old law right like it hasn't been

5916
05:17:59,760 --> 05:18:03,298
updated in a while it was created back

5917
05:18:03,298 --> 05:18:05,878
when we just had like Netscape or

5918
05:18:05,878 --> 05:18:09,540
Internet Explorer 1.0 right and so I

5919
05:18:09,540 --> 05:18:11,040
don't think there has been any more

5920
05:18:11,040 --> 05:18:13,200
updating of it in a while and so I think

5921
05:18:13,200 --> 05:18:14,520
that that's something that the

5922
05:18:14,520 --> 05:18:16,740
department of Justice might be looking

5923
05:18:16,740 --> 05:18:19,560
at in some way

5924
05:18:19,560 --> 05:18:22,280
yes sir

5925
05:18:38,100 --> 05:18:40,378
yeah um so to clarify you mean like how

5926
05:18:40,378 --> 05:18:41,760
does it start right how does this

5927
05:18:41,760 --> 05:18:44,100
process start it's very very voluntary

5928
05:18:44,100 --> 05:18:45,840
so

5929
05:18:45,840 --> 05:18:48,060
um believe it or not some like very rare

5930
05:18:48,060 --> 05:18:49,740
scenarios where the committee will be

5931
05:18:49,740 --> 05:18:51,660
like we need to look at this right now

5932
05:18:51,660 --> 05:18:54,718
because this company didn't report this

5933
05:18:54,718 --> 05:18:57,298
transaction very rare

5934
05:18:57,298 --> 05:18:58,980
um it's a very voluntary process and as

5935
05:18:58,980 --> 05:19:00,840
I was mentioning it's a it's it's a

5936
05:19:00,840 --> 05:19:02,900
partnership so a lot of the times

5937
05:19:02,900 --> 05:19:05,580
companies out there are aware of what's

5938
05:19:05,580 --> 05:19:07,440
going on right and they have the lawyers

5939
05:19:07,440 --> 05:19:09,298
they have the big lawyers that make

5940
05:19:09,298 --> 05:19:11,400
money that are advising their clients

5941
05:19:11,400 --> 05:19:13,980
when they say hey I'm deciding to sell

5942
05:19:13,980 --> 05:19:17,218
this amount of shares or I'm deciding to

5943
05:19:17,218 --> 05:19:18,240
sell

5944
05:19:18,240 --> 05:19:21,240
half of my company to this come you know

5945
05:19:21,240 --> 05:19:22,920
to this other foreign company that and

5946
05:19:22,920 --> 05:19:24,958
my company basically transacts lots of

5947
05:19:24,958 --> 05:19:28,320
data or um I focus on AI you know those

5948
05:19:28,320 --> 05:19:30,180
type of Industries

5949
05:19:30,180 --> 05:19:32,400
um and these lawyers will say hmm

5950
05:19:32,400 --> 05:19:34,440
um I think that you need to look at this

5951
05:19:34,440 --> 05:19:36,360
and they'll say look at this whole

5952
05:19:36,360 --> 05:19:39,600
entire spectrum of um cepheus which is

5953
05:19:39,600 --> 05:19:40,980
what it's called in this foreign

5954
05:19:40,980 --> 05:19:42,900
investment review because you have to

5955
05:19:42,900 --> 05:19:44,520
look at this and we have to work on this

5956
05:19:44,520 --> 05:19:46,320
and so it creates like a voluntary

5957
05:19:46,320 --> 05:19:48,840
process where they will file this

5958
05:19:48,840 --> 05:19:51,600
companies will file these reviews to us

5959
05:19:51,600 --> 05:19:53,160
right and it's basically a bunch of

5960
05:19:53,160 --> 05:19:55,860
questions and we kind of look at that

5961
05:19:55,860 --> 05:19:57,180
and we assess from there and we

5962
05:19:57,180 --> 05:19:58,500
determine whether we need to keep

5963
05:19:58,500 --> 05:20:01,798
looking at this further so it's a very

5964
05:20:01,798 --> 05:20:03,840
um voluntary process and it's rarely

5965
05:20:03,840 --> 05:20:06,660
ever a mandatory sort of we're coming at

5966
05:20:06,660 --> 05:20:09,120
you basically because we don't want we

5967
05:20:09,120 --> 05:20:11,040
want to create that relationship right

5968
05:20:11,040 --> 05:20:12,900
we want to make sure that we're creating

5969
05:20:12,900 --> 05:20:15,780
this open process and we're taking care

5970
05:20:15,780 --> 05:20:19,080
of not only the the needs of this for an

5971
05:20:19,080 --> 05:20:21,120
investment sideway because we want to

5972
05:20:21,120 --> 05:20:22,560
create competition we want to create

5973
05:20:22,560 --> 05:20:24,360
economic incentives we want to do all

5974
05:20:24,360 --> 05:20:27,240
these things but we also want to protect

5975
05:20:27,240 --> 05:20:28,980
the other side of things which is our

5976
05:20:28,980 --> 05:20:30,780
mission our national security interests

5977
05:20:30,780 --> 05:20:33,840
and also our U.S people right and making

5978
05:20:33,840 --> 05:20:35,878
sure that there's a fairness in that

5979
05:20:35,878 --> 05:20:37,080
side too

5980
05:20:37,080 --> 05:20:40,218
does that answer your question

5981
05:20:50,940 --> 05:20:56,700
right so um really do we say there are

5982
05:20:56,700 --> 05:20:58,560
times where where we won't find out

5983
05:20:58,560 --> 05:21:00,180
right like there might be some time but

5984
05:21:00,180 --> 05:21:02,580
eventually we do find out right because

5985
05:21:02,580 --> 05:21:04,860
in some way there's another agency

5986
05:21:04,860 --> 05:21:06,718
that's involved in this committee that

5987
05:21:06,718 --> 05:21:09,480
has some kind of information right and

5988
05:21:09,480 --> 05:21:11,580
it will come through in some way but

5989
05:21:11,580 --> 05:21:14,040
again I from my time that and it hasn't

5990
05:21:14,040 --> 05:21:16,560
been that long in this space of um the

5991
05:21:16,560 --> 05:21:18,900
four investment side have I seen

5992
05:21:18,900 --> 05:21:20,520
um something where this happens where

5993
05:21:20,520 --> 05:21:24,740
it's not uh reported in some way

5994
05:21:27,180 --> 05:21:29,718
yes

5995
05:21:34,440 --> 05:21:36,440
yes

5996
05:21:51,718 --> 05:21:54,240
yeah great question so there are a lot

5997
05:21:54,240 --> 05:21:55,320
of

5998
05:21:55,320 --> 05:21:56,878
um sort of like core you know companies

5999
05:21:56,878 --> 05:21:57,958
not companies excuse me like

6000
05:21:57,958 --> 05:22:01,260
organizations out there like um the ncls

6001
05:22:01,260 --> 05:22:04,320
which is like the national County uh

6002
05:22:04,320 --> 05:22:06,180
legislators or something like that there

6003
05:22:06,180 --> 05:22:08,100
if you Google them they're a great

6004
05:22:08,100 --> 05:22:09,718
resource there and they actually I think

6005
05:22:09,718 --> 05:22:11,700
provided me with these data and these

6006
05:22:11,700 --> 05:22:13,260
points and they were it was in their

6007
05:22:13,260 --> 05:22:15,420
website and they have a great chart of

6008
05:22:15,420 --> 05:22:17,218
like mapping out what privacy

6009
05:22:17,218 --> 05:22:19,200
legislations out there what has been

6010
05:22:19,200 --> 05:22:20,638
passed Etc so those type of

6011
05:22:20,638 --> 05:22:22,560
organizations that kind of Lobby for

6012
05:22:22,560 --> 05:22:25,500
states or that Lobby for counties is a

6013
05:22:25,500 --> 05:22:27,000
good one

6014
05:22:27,000 --> 05:22:29,820
um another way is to making sure that if

6015
05:22:29,820 --> 05:22:32,218
you are in this space and you're working

6016
05:22:32,218 --> 05:22:34,920
whatever position it may be having a

6017
05:22:34,920 --> 05:22:37,798
good relationship with the um attorneys

6018
05:22:37,798 --> 05:22:39,660
involved right but so every company is

6019
05:22:39,660 --> 05:22:41,040
probably going to have and especially in

6020
05:22:41,040 --> 05:22:44,218
the space some Council right and so

6021
05:22:44,218 --> 05:22:47,280
making sure that you are made aware of

6022
05:22:47,280 --> 05:22:49,620
what's going on and that you um sort of

6023
05:22:49,620 --> 05:22:51,480
speak to them right put yourself in

6024
05:22:51,480 --> 05:22:53,520
those meetings because I'm sure they're

6025
05:22:53,520 --> 05:22:55,500
having meetings and kind of inform

6026
05:22:55,500 --> 05:22:57,540
yourself of what's going on or making

6027
05:22:57,540 --> 05:22:59,700
sure that your group your team whatever

6028
05:22:59,700 --> 05:23:01,520
it may be however you're composed

6029
05:23:01,520 --> 05:23:04,378
understands that they should be sort of

6030
05:23:04,378 --> 05:23:06,780
briefed on these issues too because you

6031
05:23:06,780 --> 05:23:08,400
all need to know what's going on out

6032
05:23:08,400 --> 05:23:10,080
there too and so making sure that you're

6033
05:23:10,080 --> 05:23:12,440
aware of this is great and having that

6034
05:23:12,440 --> 05:23:15,360
awareness and reaching out to those

6035
05:23:15,360 --> 05:23:18,600
folks is good too so looking at also

6036
05:23:18,600 --> 05:23:20,160
those organizations out there that are

6037
05:23:20,160 --> 05:23:22,378
lobbying for these sectors like

6038
05:23:22,378 --> 05:23:24,718
Governors associations another one too

6039
05:23:24,718 --> 05:23:28,878
that have really great resources as well

6040
05:23:29,940 --> 05:23:32,420
yes

6041
05:23:36,660 --> 05:23:40,218
yes I'm sorry can you I can hear you

6042
05:23:43,500 --> 05:23:46,138
crypto okay

6043
05:23:46,138 --> 05:23:48,120
um so crypto right

6044
05:23:48,120 --> 05:23:51,360
um that's mostly SEC right the security

6045
05:23:51,360 --> 05:23:53,458
Exchange Commission they're the ones

6046
05:23:53,458 --> 05:23:54,958
that are sort of looking at this space

6047
05:23:54,958 --> 05:23:57,180
and so and so is treasury as well right

6048
05:23:57,180 --> 05:24:00,180
they're the ones that are more into that

6049
05:24:00,180 --> 05:24:02,580
space I do more of the critical

6050
05:24:02,580 --> 05:24:04,260
infrastructure space

6051
05:24:04,260 --> 05:24:06,000
um so I don't have too much information

6052
05:24:06,000 --> 05:24:07,798
on bitcoin

6053
05:24:07,798 --> 05:24:10,440
um or blockchain for that matter right

6054
05:24:10,440 --> 05:24:12,298
um but um they're the ones that are

6055
05:24:12,298 --> 05:24:14,580
working on that however from what my

6056
05:24:14,580 --> 05:24:16,200
research has shown and just reading

6057
05:24:16,200 --> 05:24:18,660
things like there's not much concrete

6058
05:24:18,660 --> 05:24:21,120
legislation on that and that's because

6059
05:24:21,120 --> 05:24:23,100
you know there's a lot of back and forth

6060
05:24:23,100 --> 05:24:24,958
as to like this is supposed to be a

6061
05:24:24,958 --> 05:24:27,120
space where you cut out middleman and

6062
05:24:27,120 --> 05:24:29,340
you shouldn't have any regulation but

6063
05:24:29,340 --> 05:24:31,620
then as you're probably doing your taxes

6064
05:24:31,620 --> 05:24:33,420
you'll see things like questions like do

6065
05:24:33,420 --> 05:24:35,760
you own digital currency right or things

6066
05:24:35,760 --> 05:24:38,940
like that so those are some sort of like

6067
05:24:38,940 --> 05:24:41,340
you know law improvements there like

6068
05:24:41,340 --> 05:24:43,378
like just reporting and making sure that

6069
05:24:43,378 --> 05:24:45,840
people are reporting those currencies in

6070
05:24:45,840 --> 05:24:47,520
their taxes

6071
05:24:47,520 --> 05:24:49,560
um but what happens after yeah I'm not

6072
05:24:49,560 --> 05:24:52,980
too sure but it's a space that still has

6073
05:24:52,980 --> 05:24:56,480
a lot of open questions in that

6074
05:24:57,660 --> 05:25:00,200
okay yeah

6075
05:25:10,260 --> 05:25:13,260
worked on legislation related

6076
05:25:13,260 --> 05:25:15,480
yeah

6077
05:25:15,480 --> 05:25:18,958
yeah no a good question so I think it's

6078
05:25:18,958 --> 05:25:20,580
a mixture of both and you're not going

6079
05:25:20,580 --> 05:25:22,020
to like that because every other is like

6080
05:25:22,020 --> 05:25:23,340
well it depends

6081
05:25:23,340 --> 05:25:26,160
um and that's because again I am a firm

6082
05:25:26,160 --> 05:25:27,660
believer in the way our system is run

6083
05:25:27,660 --> 05:25:29,340
right like our bureaucracy is you know

6084
05:25:29,340 --> 05:25:31,200
we have our states and we have our

6085
05:25:31,200 --> 05:25:33,060
federalism right

6086
05:25:33,060 --> 05:25:34,620
um but when it comes to like privacy

6087
05:25:34,620 --> 05:25:36,540
like something needs to be done because

6088
05:25:36,540 --> 05:25:37,860
all these states are doing different

6089
05:25:37,860 --> 05:25:39,840
things and it gets confusing right and

6090
05:25:39,840 --> 05:25:41,218
it creates a lot of barriers for

6091
05:25:41,218 --> 05:25:43,378
companies but it also creates a lot of

6092
05:25:43,378 --> 05:25:45,660
barriers for users and

6093
05:25:45,660 --> 05:25:47,520
um you know the internet we depend on it

6094
05:25:47,520 --> 05:25:50,160
a lot and it should be a global thing so

6095
05:25:50,160 --> 05:25:51,900
if we don't if we're not careful with

6096
05:25:51,900 --> 05:25:54,120
the way that we sort of legislate the

6097
05:25:54,120 --> 05:25:56,100
space it can create a lot a lot of

6098
05:25:56,100 --> 05:25:58,740
localization of data where you'll have

6099
05:25:58,740 --> 05:26:00,540
like certain you know countries just

6100
05:26:00,540 --> 05:26:02,760
focusing on their data and just having

6101
05:26:02,760 --> 05:26:05,040
like a barrier there you'll have like

6102
05:26:05,040 --> 05:26:07,620
you know us on one side and it's just

6103
05:26:07,620 --> 05:26:09,660
not gonna like speak to each other right

6104
05:26:09,660 --> 05:26:11,400
and so I think that that's something to

6105
05:26:11,400 --> 05:26:13,200
be aware of

6106
05:26:13,200 --> 05:26:14,820
um and you know just making sure that

6107
05:26:14,820 --> 05:26:17,280
we're sort of promoting that digital

6108
05:26:17,280 --> 05:26:20,040
sovereignty of you know but protect our

6109
05:26:20,040 --> 05:26:21,420
interests but at the same time we work

6110
05:26:21,420 --> 05:26:23,580
with each other and so if we have

6111
05:26:23,580 --> 05:26:26,340
legislation that's so like cut you know

6112
05:26:26,340 --> 05:26:28,740
like in pieces like privacy for example

6113
05:26:28,740 --> 05:26:30,958
then that can create some risk there too

6114
05:26:30,958 --> 05:26:34,020
like that or if we don't address like

6115
05:26:34,020 --> 05:26:36,360
data transfers then how are we going to

6116
05:26:36,360 --> 05:26:37,740
communicate with each other one day

6117
05:26:37,740 --> 05:26:39,900
right so I think that in that space

6118
05:26:39,900 --> 05:26:42,780
Federal legislation is important

6119
05:26:42,780 --> 05:26:44,580
um but then again there are certain

6120
05:26:44,580 --> 05:26:46,740
things that states should have a say

6121
05:26:46,740 --> 05:26:49,500
like Biometrics right like every agency

6122
05:26:49,500 --> 05:26:51,600
in the states have their own thing that

6123
05:26:51,600 --> 05:26:53,100
they do every state has a different

6124
05:26:53,100 --> 05:26:54,540
thing right like South Dakota's

6125
05:26:54,540 --> 05:26:55,740
interests are very different from

6126
05:26:55,740 --> 05:26:58,378
Florida's interests right so I think

6127
05:26:58,378 --> 05:27:01,200
that that there is where you should look

6128
05:27:01,200 --> 05:27:04,080
at well what space dictates States

6129
05:27:04,080 --> 05:27:06,740
activities

6130
05:27:07,440 --> 05:27:10,378
and I think that's my time so um thank

6131
05:27:10,378 --> 05:27:13,200
you all this was great I hope that you

6132
05:27:13,200 --> 05:27:14,878
got something out of this and if you

6133
05:27:14,878 --> 05:27:16,860
ever want to like reach out to me that's

6134
05:27:16,860 --> 05:27:18,540
my email there but thank you all and it

6135
05:27:18,540 --> 05:27:20,040
was great to be there thanks

6136

[Applause]

6137
05:29:55,798 --> 05:29:57,480
presentation is going to be all about

6138
05:29:57,480 --> 05:29:59,940
building a security program from someone

6139
05:29:59,940 --> 05:30:01,620
who's done it the hard way so without

6140
05:30:01,620 --> 05:30:05,660
further Ado please welcome Parker Seaman

6159
05:30:40,798 --> 05:30:42,480
make the John Deere talker John Deere

6160
05:30:42,480 --> 05:30:45,500
tractor speak in Spanish

6161
05:30:45,600 --> 05:30:48,560
um but enough about that more about me

6162
05:30:48,560 --> 05:30:50,580
as said

6163
05:30:50,580 --> 05:30:52,440
um well we'll get to about me we'll do a

6164
05:30:52,440 --> 05:30:54,420
quick little overview we'll have the

6165
05:30:54,420 --> 05:30:56,520
table contents here talking about why

6166
05:30:56,520 --> 05:30:59,218
you should and shouldn't listen to me

6167
05:30:59,218 --> 05:31:02,360
um planning a path for your program some

6168
05:31:02,360 --> 05:31:05,100
tips on software for building your

6169
05:31:05,100 --> 05:31:09,180
program the longer part will be on the

6170
05:31:09,180 --> 05:31:11,940
soft skills that go into making a

6171
05:31:11,940 --> 05:31:13,260
security program work with the people

6172
05:31:13,260 --> 05:31:15,060
who was actually going to affect and

6173
05:31:15,060 --> 05:31:17,400
then just kind of a quick recap on it

6174
05:31:17,400 --> 05:31:19,500
but a little bit about myself my name is

6175
05:31:19,500 --> 05:31:21,000
Parker Steven

6176
05:31:21,000 --> 05:31:22,860
um I work as a principal security

6177
05:31:22,860 --> 05:31:25,200
engineer at neurocore and I am a

6178
05:31:25,200 --> 05:31:28,020
communication manager at openvoice OS

6179
05:31:28,020 --> 05:31:30,240
which you can think of like kind of like

6180
05:31:30,240 --> 05:31:32,040
an Alexa but it doesn't record you and

6181
05:31:32,040 --> 05:31:35,520
doesn't work as good but it's neat

6182
05:31:35,520 --> 05:31:36,240
um

6183
05:31:36,240 --> 05:31:40,440
and my talk is more so going to be

6184
05:31:40,440 --> 05:31:42,660
focused on if you're somebody who

6185
05:31:42,660 --> 05:31:45,360
started as

6186
05:31:45,360 --> 05:31:47,458
um or rather has an interest in working

6187
05:31:47,458 --> 05:31:50,760
in security or finds themselves in a

6188
05:31:50,760 --> 05:31:52,798
situation where the the workplace they

6189
05:31:52,798 --> 05:31:55,378
are at does not have a well-developed

6190
05:31:55,378 --> 05:31:57,240
cyber security program

6191
05:31:57,240 --> 05:31:59,580
that was the case that I found myself in

6192
05:31:59,580 --> 05:32:02,100
a couple of years ago when I joined my

6193
05:32:02,100 --> 05:32:05,218
current work workplace as devops joined

6194
05:32:05,218 --> 05:32:08,840
and there was nothing in in store there

6195
05:32:08,840 --> 05:32:11,040
very quickly I started taking under

6196
05:32:11,040 --> 05:32:13,260
security projects under my wing and

6197
05:32:13,260 --> 05:32:15,480
trying to improve the

6198
05:32:15,480 --> 05:32:16,638
um

6199
05:32:16,638 --> 05:32:20,760
mature return mint maternus of our cyber

6200
05:32:20,760 --> 05:32:23,100
security program so that we could

6201
05:32:23,100 --> 05:32:24,780
actually withstand something that

6202
05:32:24,780 --> 05:32:26,280
happened to us

6203
05:32:26,280 --> 05:32:28,620
um and over that time I made some

6204
05:32:28,620 --> 05:32:30,120
mistakes but have made a lot of progress

6205
05:32:30,120 --> 05:32:32,760
and learned what it takes at least for

6206
05:32:32,760 --> 05:32:37,378
my situation to why or rather who how to

6207
05:32:37,378 --> 05:32:39,020
create something that can actually

6208
05:32:39,020 --> 05:32:41,520
function and have some sort of semblance

6209
05:32:41,520 --> 05:32:43,260
of security rather than things just

6210
05:32:43,260 --> 05:32:45,240
working when you don't face any

6211
05:32:45,240 --> 05:32:48,440
adversary or any adversaries

6212
05:32:48,440 --> 05:32:51,840
so I want to talk a little bit about why

6213
05:32:51,840 --> 05:32:54,780
I have some creators to talk about this

6214
05:32:54,780 --> 05:32:57,060
um and I'll add a little bit more

6215
05:32:57,060 --> 05:32:59,458
context to that in a second of that

6216
05:32:59,458 --> 05:33:02,760
but but first it's the

6217
05:33:02,760 --> 05:33:04,320
the reason why I think I have some

6218
05:33:04,320 --> 05:33:05,760
authority to speak on this is like I

6219
05:33:05,760 --> 05:33:07,860
said when I joined my workplace there

6220
05:33:07,860 --> 05:33:09,780
was nothing in terms of security other

6221
05:33:09,780 --> 05:33:11,580
than like base compliance type things

6222
05:33:11,580 --> 05:33:12,958
that

6223
05:33:12,958 --> 05:33:15,360
um Regulators might have for us or

6224
05:33:15,360 --> 05:33:17,458
customers might ask of us

6225
05:33:17,458 --> 05:33:19,860
and from there I started to increase

6226
05:33:19,860 --> 05:33:21,440
things incrementally

6227
05:33:21,440 --> 05:33:24,000
make us some more secure in ways that

6228
05:33:24,000 --> 05:33:26,458
aren't simply required of us but that

6229
05:33:26,458 --> 05:33:28,218
would actually help us

6230
05:33:28,218 --> 05:33:30,680
withstand some sort of attack

6231
05:33:30,680 --> 05:33:33,000
and I feel like I've got some decent

6232
05:33:33,000 --> 05:33:34,440
accreditations to this I've spoken at

6233
05:33:34,440 --> 05:33:36,298
some other security another security

6234
05:33:36,298 --> 05:33:38,040
conference I've got a master's degree

6235
05:33:38,040 --> 05:33:39,600
from this University

6236
05:33:39,600 --> 05:33:42,900
and I've been uh very

6237
05:33:42,900 --> 05:33:43,560
um

6238
05:33:43,560 --> 05:33:46,260
social for for lack of better terms in

6239
05:33:46,260 --> 05:33:49,138
the cyber security field

6240
05:33:49,138 --> 05:33:51,180
why you should take what I say with a

6241
05:33:51,180 --> 05:33:53,520
grain of salt is that my workplace is

6242
05:33:53,520 --> 05:33:57,540
unique it's a startup type thing

6243
05:33:57,540 --> 05:33:59,100
with

6244
05:33:59,100 --> 05:34:01,200
somewhat of a some that's somewhat

6245
05:34:01,200 --> 05:34:03,900
established but still changing very much

6246
05:34:03,900 --> 05:34:04,860
um

6247
05:34:04,860 --> 05:34:08,638
and my process is still ongoing and I'm

6248
05:34:08,638 --> 05:34:10,798
also still made mistakes and I see

6249
05:34:10,798 --> 05:34:12,360
myself making more mistakes in the

6250
05:34:12,360 --> 05:34:14,458
future because as good as I am in a

6251
05:34:14,458 --> 05:34:15,840
number of things I'm wrong a lot of the

6252
05:34:15,840 --> 05:34:17,760
time

6253
05:34:17,760 --> 05:34:21,420
so with that said take what I say with a

6254
05:34:21,420 --> 05:34:23,458
grain of salt and pay attention to the

6255
05:34:23,458 --> 05:34:25,860
the broad Strokes rather than on the

6256
05:34:25,860 --> 05:34:27,900
specifics

6257
05:34:27,900 --> 05:34:30,600
the arguably one of the most important

6258
05:34:30,600 --> 05:34:32,638
parts When developing your program is

6259
05:34:32,638 --> 05:34:34,680
making sure that you've planned ahead

6260
05:34:34,680 --> 05:34:37,440
rather than just trying to fit to make a

6261
05:34:37,440 --> 05:34:38,760
quick patch for whatever you see the

6262
05:34:38,760 --> 05:34:41,600
immediate issue is

6263
05:34:41,820 --> 05:34:45,000
um it when you go into a environment

6264
05:34:45,000 --> 05:34:47,940
without any sort of Protections in place

6265
05:34:47,940 --> 05:34:50,540
it can be

6266
05:34:50,540 --> 05:34:52,860
enticing to jump right in and try to fix

6267
05:34:52,860 --> 05:34:54,900
it as fast as possible and in some

6268
05:34:54,900 --> 05:34:58,680
regards that might be okay idea but when

6269
05:34:58,680 --> 05:35:01,620
you're wanting to improve a workplace's

6270
05:35:01,620 --> 05:35:02,878
security you want to make sure that

6271
05:35:02,878 --> 05:35:05,160
you're planning for the Long Haul

6272
05:35:05,160 --> 05:35:07,500
um if the companies this uh

6273
05:35:07,500 --> 05:35:08,638
understanding is that they're going to

6274
05:35:08,638 --> 05:35:09,600
be there for a while and they're going

6275
05:35:09,600 --> 05:35:12,000
to want to make sure that the solutions

6276
05:35:12,000 --> 05:35:14,820
put in place will be long lasting simply

6277
05:35:14,820 --> 05:35:16,798
putting a patch into place a Band-Aid on

6278
05:35:16,798 --> 05:35:18,718
a broken bone will not last

6279
05:35:18,718 --> 05:35:19,980
so

6280
05:35:19,980 --> 05:35:23,700
how do you make a plan you ask people

6281
05:35:23,700 --> 05:35:25,458
who are smarter than you

6282
05:35:25,458 --> 05:35:29,218
the the sisa CIS nist all of these

6283
05:35:29,218 --> 05:35:32,520
different organizations have a lot of

6284
05:35:32,520 --> 05:35:34,798
resources available for being able to

6285
05:35:34,798 --> 05:35:38,520
help you create a framework a plan and a

6286
05:35:38,520 --> 05:35:42,138
process for you to create a program that

6287
05:35:42,138 --> 05:35:45,780
helps you improve your security

6288
05:35:45,780 --> 05:35:47,580
the

6289
05:35:47,580 --> 05:35:50,340
um oh shoot my words are gone uh

6290
05:35:50,340 --> 05:35:54,000
regardless the main point of the plan is

6291
05:35:54,000 --> 05:35:59,000
to your plan should focus on

6292
05:36:00,060 --> 05:36:03,120
for fixing these smaller aspects of your

6293
05:36:03,120 --> 05:36:05,700
workplace rather than improving the

6294
05:36:05,700 --> 05:36:08,820
things that might be more fun while

6295
05:36:08,820 --> 05:36:10,980
doing an intern an internal pen test or

6296
05:36:10,980 --> 05:36:13,020
an internal phishing type campaign might

6297
05:36:13,020 --> 05:36:15,480
be more fun you should probably make

6298
05:36:15,480 --> 05:36:18,900
sure that your password policy is strong

6299
05:36:18,900 --> 05:36:21,000
make sure that you have MFA enable it on

6300
05:36:21,000 --> 05:36:22,500
different things on all of your software

6301
05:36:22,500 --> 05:36:24,360
make sure you have a you have an

6302
05:36:24,360 --> 05:36:25,798
inventory of what you're actually

6303
05:36:25,798 --> 05:36:28,560
supposed to protect those aren't as fun

6304
05:36:28,560 --> 05:36:31,798
but incredibly necessary for making sure

6305
05:36:31,798 --> 05:36:35,780
that your environment is secured

6306
05:36:35,958 --> 05:36:39,240
when you're looking into tools to help

6307
05:36:39,240 --> 05:36:42,360
secure your workplace there are

6308
05:36:42,360 --> 05:36:44,458
um obviously a lot of options out there

6309
05:36:44,458 --> 05:36:47,458
and a lot of them with varying prices

6310
05:36:47,458 --> 05:36:48,740
a lot of different Enterprise

6311
05:36:48,740 --> 05:36:53,340
technologies will give a a high price

6312
05:36:53,340 --> 05:36:56,340
tag and promise a lot and they might be

6313
05:36:56,340 --> 05:36:57,718
able to be helpful but you want to be

6314
05:36:57,718 --> 05:36:59,100
careful to make sure you pick something

6315
05:36:59,100 --> 05:37:01,020
that is actually going to be well

6316
05:37:01,020 --> 05:37:03,660
fitting for your workplace and not

6317
05:37:03,660 --> 05:37:06,540
overdo it and on the note of overdoing

6318
05:37:06,540 --> 05:37:09,540
it you um

6319
05:37:09,540 --> 05:37:12,540
apologies

6320
05:37:13,980 --> 05:37:17,340
if you if you're worried about

6321
05:37:17,340 --> 05:37:19,080
finding a place for cyber security

6322
05:37:19,080 --> 05:37:22,620
program a budget might come to mind if

6323
05:37:22,620 --> 05:37:24,840
nobody has ever put time into it they

6324
05:37:24,840 --> 05:37:27,060
might see the addition of security

6325
05:37:27,060 --> 05:37:29,820
tooling as a burden especially a

6326
05:37:29,820 --> 05:37:33,360
financial one so it's useful to make

6327
05:37:33,360 --> 05:37:36,840
make uh oh no my slides are we're going

6328
05:37:36,840 --> 05:37:39,420
wrong oh well what was supposed to show

6329
05:37:39,420 --> 05:37:41,340
up is some examples of some various open

6330
05:37:41,340 --> 05:37:43,560
source softwares that are Enterprise

6331
05:37:43,560 --> 05:37:46,680
grade and can be paid for but typically

6332
05:37:46,680 --> 05:37:49,378
what those types of things are is the

6333
05:37:49,378 --> 05:37:51,600
software itself is open source and you

6334
05:37:51,600 --> 05:37:53,820
can pay for to either have them provide

6335
05:37:53,820 --> 05:37:56,940
you support or to host it for you and

6336
05:37:56,940 --> 05:37:59,820
those are a good way to get kind of your

6337
05:37:59,820 --> 05:38:02,820
foot through the door to show how much

6338
05:38:02,820 --> 05:38:05,100
um a tool like that can really improve

6339
05:38:05,100 --> 05:38:07,020
things it doesn't add much to cost

6340
05:38:07,020 --> 05:38:09,958
whatever whatever the time and possibly

6341
05:38:09,958 --> 05:38:12,780
server hosting cost it is to host a a

6342
05:38:12,780 --> 05:38:14,840
waza server or

6343
05:38:14,840 --> 05:38:18,120
OSS EC ossc I forget the name of it

6344
05:38:18,120 --> 05:38:21,360
specifically a showdown license to help

6345
05:38:21,360 --> 05:38:23,820
scan your network the time and resources

6346
05:38:23,820 --> 05:38:25,320
that basically that go into something

6347
05:38:25,320 --> 05:38:28,320
like that cost much less than paying for

6348
05:38:28,320 --> 05:38:32,520
a full software suite but can provide

6349
05:38:32,520 --> 05:38:36,378
some deliverables to you to take to

6350
05:41:20,280 --> 05:41:23,100
hello

6351
05:41:23,100 --> 05:41:25,020
was feeling bad about the process and

6352
05:41:25,020 --> 05:41:26,040
that there were still some people who

6353
05:41:26,040 --> 05:41:27,600
were upset about it and when I mentioned

6354
05:41:27,600 --> 05:41:29,940
when I was having a review with my my

6355
05:41:29,940 --> 05:41:31,740
boss I mentioned the people who are

6356
05:41:31,740 --> 05:41:33,298
upset about it he said oh well they

6357
05:41:33,298 --> 05:41:35,520
always complain about things

6358
05:41:35,520 --> 05:41:36,958
so

6359
05:41:36,958 --> 05:41:39,120
I don't mean to devalue the time and

6360
05:41:39,120 --> 05:41:40,260
effort that goes into doing something

6361
05:41:40,260 --> 05:41:42,780
like that it's sort of a give and a take

6362
05:41:42,780 --> 05:41:45,360
or a better column a bit of column B in

6363
05:41:45,360 --> 05:41:47,100
that you should spend some time to make

6364
05:41:47,100 --> 05:41:48,660
sure you bring everyone along with you

6365
05:41:48,660 --> 05:41:51,480
educate people about the risks

6366
05:41:51,480 --> 05:41:53,458
except that it's not always going to

6367
05:41:53,458 --> 05:41:57,377
work sometimes it's just like that

6368
05:41:59,520 --> 05:42:03,240
um so to

6369
05:42:03,240 --> 05:42:06,060
great uh there's supposed to be more of

6370
05:42:06,060 --> 05:42:08,700
these slides and the demo gods do not

6371
05:42:08,700 --> 05:42:10,860
like me today but that's fine

6372
05:42:10,860 --> 05:42:12,180
so

6373
05:42:12,180 --> 05:42:16,080
to conclude the

6374
05:42:16,080 --> 05:42:19,200
most important parts are that you should

6375
05:42:19,200 --> 05:42:21,240
make sure you have a robust plan in

6376
05:42:21,240 --> 05:42:25,520
place When developing a a program

6377
05:42:25,520 --> 05:42:29,760
uh make use of Open Source and

6378
05:42:29,760 --> 05:42:33,240
less expensive software to help justify

6379
05:42:33,240 --> 05:42:35,940
the needs of cyber security and spend

6380
05:42:35,940 --> 05:42:39,060
time with the people to ensure that they

6381
05:42:39,060 --> 05:42:42,060
are with you if they can't love the

6382
05:42:42,060 --> 05:42:43,860
changes being made at least help and

6383
05:42:43,860 --> 05:42:45,480
spend some time to help them understand

6384
05:42:45,480 --> 05:42:47,899
it

6385
05:42:48,180 --> 05:42:52,260
now any questions comments concerns

6386
05:42:52,260 --> 05:42:53,760
heckling

6387
05:42:53,760 --> 05:42:56,298
what's up

6388
05:43:17,400 --> 05:43:19,798
bigger plan things and some smaller plan

6389
05:43:19,798 --> 05:43:22,160
things

6390
05:43:25,320 --> 05:43:27,120
I did try my best

6391
05:43:27,120 --> 05:43:29,400
to explain you know here's why this is

6392
05:43:29,400 --> 05:43:30,480
important here's what this is going to

6393
05:43:30,480 --> 05:43:31,620
do

6394
05:43:31,620 --> 05:43:34,138
even though it seems inconvenient or

6395
05:43:34,138 --> 05:43:36,559
it's going to take

6396
05:43:36,840 --> 05:43:39,000
a budgeting position

6397
05:43:39,000 --> 05:43:41,340
which came across me they felt like

6398
05:43:41,340 --> 05:43:43,740
ever did you ever experience any kind of

6399
05:43:43,740 --> 05:43:45,480
pushback for your

6400
05:43:45,480 --> 05:43:48,980
recommended security measures

6401
05:43:49,740 --> 05:43:51,958
so the question if anybody couldn't hear

6402
05:43:51,958 --> 05:43:53,340
it is

6403
05:43:53,340 --> 05:43:55,920
um when proposing types of security

6404
05:43:55,920 --> 05:43:58,020
improvements sometimes you get pushback

6405
05:43:58,020 --> 05:44:00,420
on them whether they're large changes or

6406
05:44:00,420 --> 05:44:02,160
small changes and they come from all

6407
05:44:02,160 --> 05:44:03,900
forms from budget to technical to

6408
05:44:03,900 --> 05:44:06,840
everything and how would I address those

6409
05:44:06,840 --> 05:44:08,520
pushbacks

6410
05:44:08,520 --> 05:44:12,000
um I'll admit at the start not well we

6411
05:44:12,000 --> 05:44:13,798
had this one software suite that we were

6412
05:44:13,798 --> 05:44:16,798
using and I noticed I could trace back

6413
05:44:16,798 --> 05:44:18,240
the version of that software to the

6414
05:44:18,240 --> 05:44:19,980
founding of the company and I brought

6415
05:44:19,980 --> 05:44:22,138
that up in a meeting and I said we

6416
05:44:22,138 --> 05:44:23,638
should probably get this updated it's

6417
05:44:23,638 --> 05:44:25,200
publicly facing and needs to be updated

6418
05:44:25,200 --> 05:44:26,580
my boss said well we can get to that

6419
05:44:26,580 --> 05:44:29,280
this year and I went this year

6420
05:44:29,280 --> 05:44:30,900
I had been at the company maybe five

6421
05:44:30,900 --> 05:44:32,280
months at that point

6422
05:44:32,280 --> 05:44:34,080
and I got lucky that nothing worse

6423
05:44:34,080 --> 05:44:35,878
happened

6424
05:44:35,878 --> 05:44:36,600
um

6425
05:44:36,600 --> 05:44:39,660
addressing pushback with software that

6426
05:44:39,660 --> 05:44:41,340
or changes that they don't see as is

6427
05:44:41,340 --> 05:44:43,620
necessary I think

6428
05:44:43,620 --> 05:44:44,638
um

6429
05:44:44,638 --> 05:44:47,760
providing examples of Industry standards

6430
05:44:47,760 --> 05:44:50,458
and where this is useful elsewhere is

6431
05:44:50,458 --> 05:44:52,740
helpful that can be sometimes harder to

6432
05:44:52,740 --> 05:44:54,360
find

6433
05:44:54,360 --> 05:44:56,480
um

6434
05:44:58,860 --> 05:45:02,280
in cases where you can't

6435
05:45:02,280 --> 05:45:03,058
um

6436
05:45:03,058 --> 05:45:05,580
find examples to help back up your

6437
05:45:05,580 --> 05:45:07,700
evidence or

6438
05:45:07,700 --> 05:45:10,798
find them unwilling to work with you in

6439
05:45:10,798 --> 05:45:12,780
creating a plan that works for everybody

6440
05:45:12,780 --> 05:45:16,458
in terms of changing things

6441
05:45:16,980 --> 05:45:18,958
polite persistence

6442
05:45:18,958 --> 05:45:21,000
which is a nice way of see saying being

6443
05:45:21,000 --> 05:45:24,620
annoying for a long time

6444
05:45:24,780 --> 05:45:26,218
um

6445
05:45:26,218 --> 05:45:29,340
because it's not often times that I I

6446
05:45:29,340 --> 05:45:33,058
believe people dislike the security

6447
05:45:33,058 --> 05:45:35,160
change exactly it's that people don't

6448
05:45:35,160 --> 05:45:36,718
like having what they have been doing

6449
05:45:36,718 --> 05:45:40,320
for a long time suddenly changing

6450
05:45:40,320 --> 05:45:41,280
um

6451
05:45:41,280 --> 05:45:45,718
so providing a road map and

6452
05:45:45,718 --> 05:45:47,878
gentle reminders of how this can be

6453
05:45:47,878 --> 05:45:50,340
useful can help break down those walls

6454
05:45:50,340 --> 05:45:52,138
you don't

6455
05:45:52,138 --> 05:45:53,878
um to further the analogy of the wall

6456
05:45:53,878 --> 05:45:56,700
you don't need to destroy the wall just

6457
05:45:56,700 --> 05:45:58,440
ship at it

6458
05:45:58,440 --> 05:46:02,000
does that answer your question at all

6459
05:46:02,280 --> 05:46:04,620
anyone else

6460
05:46:04,620 --> 05:46:07,218
what's up

6461
05:46:07,680 --> 05:46:09,420
five billion

6462
05:46:09,420 --> 05:46:11,899
sorry

6463
05:46:12,958 --> 05:46:16,680
I say we have about a hundred ish and I

6464
05:46:16,680 --> 05:46:19,860
would say

6465
05:46:20,520 --> 05:46:22,680
oh it's a little less than 100 but I'd

6466
05:46:22,680 --> 05:46:25,260
say about 10 10 or 15.

6467
05:46:25,260 --> 05:46:29,539
more than I wanted less than I expected

6468
05:46:31,138 --> 05:46:33,739
what's up

6469
05:46:37,500 --> 05:46:40,638
can you say that one more time please

6470
05:46:44,400 --> 05:46:46,920
so the question is what do I mean by a

6471
05:46:46,920 --> 05:46:49,200
robust plan and I think the best way I

6472
05:46:49,200 --> 05:46:51,780
could try to explain that is

6473
05:46:51,780 --> 05:46:53,820
when you're proposing security changes

6474
05:46:53,820 --> 05:46:55,378
to a company that's never had this or

6475
05:46:55,378 --> 05:46:56,940
never had this in the focus you're going

6476
05:46:56,940 --> 05:46:58,680
to have a lot of questions about why

6477
05:46:58,680 --> 05:47:02,218
this is necessary So the plan should try

6478
05:47:02,218 --> 05:47:05,100
to meet them where they are seeing

6479
05:47:05,100 --> 05:47:06,840
issues with it

6480
05:47:06,840 --> 05:47:08,900
um

6481
05:47:09,000 --> 05:47:11,400
having a good timeline

6482
05:47:11,400 --> 05:47:13,740
and

6483
05:47:13,740 --> 05:47:16,080
trying to help show where this is

6484
05:47:16,080 --> 05:47:17,580
necessary

6485
05:47:17,580 --> 05:47:18,120
um

6486
05:47:18,120 --> 05:47:20,280
on top of that

6487
05:47:20,280 --> 05:47:21,958
um

6488
05:47:21,958 --> 05:47:24,360
making it known that if you weren't

6489
05:47:24,360 --> 05:47:25,260
there

6490
05:47:25,260 --> 05:47:27,480
that this could still continue to

6491
05:47:27,480 --> 05:47:29,400
function

6492
05:47:29,400 --> 05:47:30,600
um

6493
05:47:30,600 --> 05:47:33,180
yeah

6494
05:47:33,180 --> 05:47:35,040
any other questions

6495
05:47:35,040 --> 05:47:36,360
or

6496
05:47:36,360 --> 05:47:38,218
I will also open the door too if you

6497
05:47:38,218 --> 05:47:40,440
have any advice for me who is still very

6498
05:47:40,440 --> 05:47:42,660
much learning I'm open to anything you

6499
05:47:42,660 --> 05:47:43,920
have to say

6500
05:47:43,920 --> 05:47:46,519
yep

6501
05:47:58,080 --> 05:48:02,218
no but what I so really what I managed

6502
05:48:02,218 --> 05:48:03,420
to do

6503
05:48:03,420 --> 05:48:05,218
I'll tell you the first time I propose

6504
05:48:05,218 --> 05:48:07,400
it to my boss

6505
05:48:07,400 --> 05:48:10,500
my plan was like a three-year plan we're

6506
05:48:10,500 --> 05:48:11,820
going to integrate things into entity

6507
05:48:11,820 --> 05:48:13,980
systems get automated increase registry

6508
05:48:13,980 --> 05:48:15,298
that way

6509
05:48:15,298 --> 05:48:17,400
cut clear here's our options here's how

6510
05:48:17,400 --> 05:48:18,900
much it's going to cost boom boom right

6511
05:48:18,900 --> 05:48:21,600
and it failed miserably it's like we

6512
05:48:21,600 --> 05:48:23,820
have no room for this in the budget CEO

6513
05:48:23,820 --> 05:48:25,020
is never going to go for it this isn't

6514
05:48:25,020 --> 05:48:26,700
going to work we need to see the benefit

6515
05:48:26,700 --> 05:48:29,760
I'm like okay well let me

6516
05:48:29,760 --> 05:48:33,420
so what I managed to do was I you know I

6517
05:48:33,420 --> 05:48:34,200
read

6518
05:48:34,200 --> 05:48:37,080
like restructured my proposal and I kind

6519
05:48:37,080 --> 05:48:40,378
of scooped in more Automation and better

6520
05:48:40,378 --> 05:48:42,840
user experience with improved security

6521
05:48:42,840 --> 05:48:45,540
and I kind of made security as of I've

6522
05:48:45,540 --> 05:48:47,100
like made it look like it was secondary

6523
05:48:47,100 --> 05:48:49,260
in it but

6524
05:48:49,260 --> 05:48:51,840
um it really was my end right so I made

6525
05:48:51,840 --> 05:48:54,058
the primary like single sign-on things

6526
05:48:54,058 --> 05:48:55,558
like automation

6527
05:48:55,558 --> 05:48:57,000
um with you know improved user

6528
05:48:57,000 --> 05:48:58,740
experience in that way as well as

6529
05:48:58,740 --> 05:49:00,420
rolling in things like password manager

6530
05:49:00,420 --> 05:49:01,740
and that kind of thing making their

6531
05:49:01,740 --> 05:49:02,580
point

6532
05:49:02,580 --> 05:49:03,600
everybody what I also said as a

6533
05:49:03,600 --> 05:49:05,940
secondary benefit hey we have integrated

6534
05:49:05,940 --> 05:49:08,280
things with our identity system and MFA

6535
05:49:08,280 --> 05:49:10,080
on top of that because you need identity

6536
05:49:10,080 --> 05:49:13,080
systems or single sign-ups right

6537
05:49:13,080 --> 05:49:15,420
exactly uh for those who couldn't hear

6538
05:49:15,420 --> 05:49:17,160
is uh compounding of what I had said

6539
05:49:17,160 --> 05:49:18,610
about how to

6540
05:49:18,610 --> 05:49:19,020
[Music]

6541
05:49:19,020 --> 05:49:19,798
um

6542
05:49:19,798 --> 05:49:23,100
work with your company's dislikes of

6543
05:49:23,100 --> 05:49:25,020
security to help try to use those to

6544
05:49:25,020 --> 05:49:29,040
build up into something that's more um

6545
05:49:29,040 --> 05:49:30,958
fully fully idealized is that close to

6546
05:49:30,958 --> 05:49:33,859
what you're saying

6547
05:49:35,638 --> 05:49:38,360
anyone else

6548
05:49:39,660 --> 05:49:41,280
