whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> skirts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute which is maybe</font>

23
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,009
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> vejo skirts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> institute is that</font>

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,130
we have a lecture which is called at

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,950
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> my lecture hack pro or in german</font>

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,880
practicum fajita technique and as most

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,500
of you maybe know this lecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about</font>

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,140
two things so first of all we have

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,420
people international speakers from all

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,880
over the world from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USA from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> belgium</font>

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,890
from russia and so on and what they do

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,399
is that they talk about security we talk

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,409
about new things and V speakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly the speakers who are also here</font>

35
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,470
at this conference so what we did is

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,869
that we invited yeah let me call the

37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,490
best of speakers from the former hack

38
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,049
pro but there are also many many more

39
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,619
maybe in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next editions who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

40
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great trust me and on the</font>

41
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">other side so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point two we tell</font>

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,880
the people something about web security

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,820
so how to hack back applications how to

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,658
attack them how to defend them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,098
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a really cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and</font>

46
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is maybe also one of the reasons</font>

47
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,540
why was this lecture is so highly

48
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,400
frequented well

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,828
accra is actually more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an electro</font>

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,430
because we have an evening<font color="#E5E5E5"> event at g</font>

51
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:22,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">data as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is the case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today and we have</font>

52
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:29,099
the speaker which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unusual for</font>

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:31,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">university and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's vatten not a</font>

54
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:33,629
surprise that we also have an expansion

55
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:36,390
of hack drug called hack pro all-stars

56
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:39,510
so what we do is that we have an own

57
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:44,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">over spear up chapter in the past in</font>

58
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:47,040
2014 and amsterdam and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in 2015 oh</font>

59
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,040
it's 2015 in EM sedan and 2013 in

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">hamburg and rebels nearly the same as</font>

61
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">well sick but was like is this time here</font>

62
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,239
at you were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> university a separate</font>

63
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,359
conference for itself without other

64
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,310
stuff with about<font color="#CCCCCC"> crew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

65
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:08,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">OVAs people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where tendra i can really</font>

66
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:14,129
recommend most conference for them well

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:18,060
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind will check was to have a</font>

68
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:21,120
hacker alike but an old conference which

69
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,419
is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a lecture but we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

70
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">quality talk as a justification fagtron</font>

71
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:29,970
and we have a few goals so our first

72
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,919
goal is that we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be independent</font>

73
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we also want to reach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those goals in</font>

74
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,540
the future and future of rhythms so we

75
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,280
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> promotional even you can</font>

76
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,440
maybe see some roll-ups here and some

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,389
advertisements but just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit so</font>

78
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,159
we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> any salesman who sell you</font>

79
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,690
some web application firewalls which are

80
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,819
actually totally worthless because they

81
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,199
don't filter the interesting stuff right

82
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:54,328
that you can bypass our second colors

83
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:59,040
that we want to be low price you may be

84
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,930
solve it as most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did that our</font>

85
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,638
ticket prices<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe 10 prospered from</font>

86
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,949
the ticket price in comparison to other

87
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,689
conferences the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that we did it</font>

88
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:08,489
for free here we organize it for free

89
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:09,959
and that we had a lot of sponsors who

90
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,530
believed in us from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very first</font>

91
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,370
second i will show you some in the next

92
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,649
slide the next slides and we are

93
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,560
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a community even service even</font>

94
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:24,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be from friends for friends so</font>

95
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,190
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look into the audience I can see</font>

96
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that maybe 60 or</font>

97
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,900
seventy percent of you are already known

98
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,920
so I know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we had some</font>

99
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,690
security trainings or we have tested

100
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,280
something for you or we adjust

101
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,190
colleagues and drink a beer together in

102
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,549
the afternoon or evening who knows and

103
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,710
our last goal is to charity aspect so

104
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,780
all of the money which we will make sort

105
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,060
of profit from the tickets when we spent

106
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,380
or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization which helps children</font>

107
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:58,470
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization is called gains</font>

108
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,650
ablution and RV and what we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fed</font>

109
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,800
way help children with cancer they help

110
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:09,390
children in emergency situations so you

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:12,630
can imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are nearly dead</font>

112
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,700
because they are ill and vast<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vagos</font>

113
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">short pain waivers of musicals and so on</font>

114
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that yeah helping children</font>

115
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,040
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the best things what we can do</font>

116
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,080
and next to it we can enjoy this evening

117
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is quite one of the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

118
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,780
right and this even wouldn't be possible

119
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,550
without our sponsors of course this is

120
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,489
