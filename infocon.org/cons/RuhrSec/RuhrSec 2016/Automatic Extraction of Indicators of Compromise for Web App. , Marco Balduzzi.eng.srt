work on different topics we do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,890
focus on malware we also work as a for

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">example in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this context in web security</font>

we work on no privacy of social network

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,809
or anything think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and we also do a</font>

17

lot when it comes to cyber crime

18
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,190

common background as most of you guys

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,340
here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all very active</font>

25
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,750
in the open source community and a

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,080
quiche community since more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:19,439
years so like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCC camp and any kind of</font>

28
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:21,030
old-school acting camper was something

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,699
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really enjoyed in the past and</font>

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm still doing it so what I'm going to</font>

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,909
talk today as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the title</font>

32
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,860
here is a work I did with two colleague

33
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,659
of mine from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Eureka</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Institute which is</font>

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a research lab located in South France</font>

35
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,860
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish this work at double double 16</font>

36
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,679
a month ago so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's PC is pretty recent</font>

37
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,729
so what we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we basically build a</font>

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,579
system to extract what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

39
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,740
indicator of compromise and particularly

40
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">to vdd for web application so let me</font>

41
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,179
directly jump into into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topic of</font>

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,119
what is it what is an indicator of

43
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,509
compromise so indicator of compromise is

44
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,369
normally used in a incident transpose

45
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,449
operation as much as in computer

46
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:12,470
forensic because we cater of compromise

47
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,630
is actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> forensic artifact</font>

48
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,109
that is used to indicate whether a

49
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,990
system has been ever compromised by an

50
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:25,010
attacker or<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being for infective by</font>

51
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:28,280
malware so every is if you work like

52
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,410
within company that has a consultancy

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,960
service and you do like a forensic and I

54
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,460
system what you look you look for

55
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,130
indicator of compromise so you look

56
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:40,160
whether for example there is a specific

57
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,890
file in a for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example attempt directory</font>

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,040
or in a in a directory<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is often</font>

59
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:49,730
used by as a dropper tool by the

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,440
attacker or whether there is a specific

61
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:55,280
registry key in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows registry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,109
you can also look<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a network</font>

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,920
standpoint so if you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

64
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,150
like very weird outbound connection it

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,649
could be for example that some of the

66
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,590
machine in<font color="#E5E5E5"> vain at work being</font>

67
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,300
compromised by<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Bartlett so in that</font>

68
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,980
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know some traffic</font>

69
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,860
going out to the command control server

70
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,260
that's for example an indicator of

71
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,019
compromise for for a specific model

72
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,899
install<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could also look</font>

73
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,120
at logs so if you see like a log<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,750
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like looking failures on your own</font>

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,130
I don't know SH server<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might think</font>

76
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that somebody know is nice to brute</font>

77
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:34,070
force your your account so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

78
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,730
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of indicator of compromise that</font>

79
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:42,560
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> widely used in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by my analyst</font>

80
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,690
worldwide so what we did in our work was

81
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,330
to extend the concept of indicator of

82
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,859
compromise to web application which is

83
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never done before and</font>

84
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">on top of that we also be the assistant</font>

85
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> automatically detect web and as a</font>

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,410
consequence since we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font>

87
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,120
an indicator compromise we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

88
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:03,470
detect all those web application<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

89
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:07,010
have been compromised<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

90
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:10,940
include somehow inve in a in a web

91
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,859
application<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vindicator of compromise so</font>

92
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,700
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you a couple of</font>

93
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,930
screenshot about the face beds and then

94
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:21,909
you can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d know what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

95
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,910
common with punks either part

96
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:36,780
from where ya from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pakistan then you</font>

97
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:40,210
have a business the face by team teach

98
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,049
the skull and some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> matrix</font>

99
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:47,430
background and then your<font color="#CCCCCC"> vet so do you</font>

100
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what we have in common is free</font>

101
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:55,300
somebody can<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess it so what we have in</font>

102
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">common is that very similar backgrounds</font>

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,039
so the three of them they have this one

104
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,539
wave<font color="#CCCCCC"> thunderstorm they are one of a kind</font>

105
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:09,400
of matrix<font color="#E5E5E5"> style background so this is</font>

106
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:11,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the simple survey sure is that when an</font>

107
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,049
attacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised a web application</font>

108
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,710
what often does you rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on external</font>

109
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,360
content what we call accessories scripts

110
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,210
for example in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> to render</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

111
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,960
page so it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the CSS they</font>

112
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:28,388
use to travel i give a thunder stone on

113
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the background or to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have like a matrix</font>

114
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:34,060
style facial like background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

115
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of accessory script interesting</font>

116
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,229
they are not necessary militias like in

117
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:45,370
this case with CSS used for a background

118
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:47,650
is not malicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but their presence</font>

119
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,289
can be like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Quetta</font>

120
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,599
compromises so can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of can be</font>

121
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,610
tell us look this page might be

122
00:05:52,599 --> 00:06:00,300
compromised because it included this

123
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:02,380
background so having some of example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

124
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,510
be successful script are for example

125
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,800
popular JavaScript libraries has to be

126
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:11,979
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> jQuery or beautifier that control</font>

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,510
the look and feel of a page to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font>

128
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:17,169
like for example of tender<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phaser</font>

129
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:20,229
they used like wave background maybe

130
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:23,469
noise some music in the background only

131
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:28,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some images promoting Van Aken</font>

132
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:30,130
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so in or beautify like to to</font>

133
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">make their page like cool because we are</font>

134
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:35,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">elite because they want to actually be</font>

135
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,969
proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where the face bed or you can</font>

136
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,440
have like script that implement the

137
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:41,380
reasonable function such as browser

138
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,229
fingerprinting that's very common for

139
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,719
example when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I compromised the page and</font>

140
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:48,760
they stall and I can exploit kit so in

141
00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:52,870
that case they're all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> explicate up</font>

142
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,669
down up there what we do they basically

143
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,080

kind of code is often a reused over and

150
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,779
over and it's not real malicious it just

151
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:15,120
in a fingerprinting equivalent

157
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,620
it mean it means that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font>

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,010
is that their presence can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

precisely pinpoint compromise or armful

172
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:18,099
with an example so this is example of a

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,979
code that we found on any compromise web

174
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:23,020
page so you can see the attack carry

175
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:26,190
change the title of a page and then

176
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,440
include the script<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay referencing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

180
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,430
just do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> grid like a fake image tag and</font>

181
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:44,150
then what is is set like the source of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

image<font color="#E5E5E5"> that URL what does this basically</font>

183

187
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:06,910
tackle does that because often what they

188
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,189
do they use like automated scanners to

189
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,620
compromise a wide number of web

190

<font color="#E5E5E5">they could itself this JavaScript does</font>

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,390
nothing bad so does not contain any hip

compromise and to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this decatur</font>

209
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:11,880

216
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:35,610

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:42,720
in santa code itself is behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so how</font>

can we identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> this code as being used</font>

219
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,420
in the malicious contest by some bad

220
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,859
guys so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> subtly they discover all work</font>

221
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,290
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we know that the script is</font>

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,699
used nations contest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is how do we</font>

225
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:00,959
wanna say valid I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> use demolitions</font>

226
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:04,469
context so what we start so we start

227
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:08,939
with work by by deploying an a web a

228
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:11,430
honeypot this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous work made by</font>

229
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,230
some colleague of ours so what we have

230
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:18,620
here is what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a holly pot made a</font>

231
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:23,250
highlighter actual web an ipod made of

232
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:25,680
500 domains that point to different

233
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,269
vulnerable web application so we have

234
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,959
web application like the common web

235
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:34,290
application like<font color="#E5E5E5"> wordpress joomla as</font>

236
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,540
much as some custom web application with

237
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,550
different type of vulnerabilities many

238
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,670
sequel injection or common injection

239
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:43,979
which are the easiest services

240
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:48,180
vulnerability being used by attackers to

241
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,880
compromise a web application and what we

242
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:54,000
do we end with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web application in a</font>

243
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">linux containers inside the earth or</font>

244

machine that point what we do at runtime

245
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:05,819
admit that I we take a snapshot of vm

246
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:07,500
and we make a diff of a snapshot with

247
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:12,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original</font>

248
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:15,300
with the original vm such that if the vm

249
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,160
is being compromised and if attacker has

250
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,579
even upload some files or change some

251
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,930
files or tamper with a with application

252
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,570
sure we can we can basically

253
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,089
automatically extract that forensic

254
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:30,060
artifact and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we store everything in</font>

255
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,830
a database of course during<font color="#CCCCCC"> run time</font>

256
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,270
after we did that we also revert back

257
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:39,690
the snack shop to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original version</font>

258
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,600
of a novel of vm to prevent basically

259
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:45,450
the bad guys of using vm over and over

260
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,970
to talk somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else on top of that</font>

everything ran into this view<font color="#CCCCCC"> thomasine</font>

262
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,250

263

firewall outside vm to prevent outbound

264
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,730
traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other production so what we</font>

265
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,460
do as I said we automatically strut

272
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,610

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript as i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you later in</font>

275
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,200
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we specifically focus on</font>

276
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript URLs so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we</font>

block and right click of a mouse which

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,770
seems like we're stupid but actually

288
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,100
they use it a lot because they do not

289
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:08,160
want that visitors that load the page

290
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,860
being fairly the face page they they

291
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,829
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the visitor to google the</font>

292
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,690
source code of the page<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

293
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,100
know we with our expert we just do

294
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,589
control you and we look at the source

295
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,910
code but a<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal user right click with</font>

296
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,980
the mouse and directly

297
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:26,699
then you source code so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> used this</font>

298
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of system to to prevent so as I</font>

299
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,950
said this script are clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> de novo</font>

300
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">blind but they are using malicious</font>

301
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,550
content so it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult by</font>

302
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,980
looking at the content to understand

303
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,349
whether this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very indicator of</font>

304
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,260
compromise or not so what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

305
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:48,300
when you have to extend analysis to the

306
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:52,740
context around this<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript URL so</font>

307
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:57,120
what we do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look here we look for</font>

308
00:14:52,740 --> 00:15:00,240
public web pages that<font color="#CCCCCC"> include reference</font>

309
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,760
to our indicator<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we have this</font>

310
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Web early part and we extract this</font>

311
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript URLs and then we look over</font>

312
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,040
winter for all those pages that include

313
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,230
a reference to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel skip URL so</font>

314
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,209
we first said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google you</font>

315
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,560
know mean we all know you use google so

316
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,110
Google should i'll pass on<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad but</font>

317
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">google all index the content of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a page</font>

318
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you can search for the term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is in</font>

319
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,740
the content of a page but not in the

320
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,870
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> code itself and it does not have</font>

321
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,050
this does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not support javascript so you</font>

322
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,210
cannot search for at least the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in-text</font>

323
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,849
technical support bed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use a man</font>

324
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,320
path which was free to use when we did

325
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,330
the research last year and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

326
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,000
to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that but man puff is great</font>

327
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:45,330
because yes HTML and JavaScript source

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,330
code support and you can easily query I

329
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:51,020
can ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me all pages</font>

330
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:55,290
including in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source code and visual</font>

331
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:58,460
and very coverage over 200 million

00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:02,120
website which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not much but is not a</font>

333
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:05,490
few which pretty is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for a</font>

334
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,720
full proof<font color="#E5E5E5"> of concept so we be the</font>

335
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:13,260
corolla for<font color="#E5E5E5"> main path and we we search</font>

336
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:17,880
for for hov see you now we extracted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

337
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:24,960
first 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> websites including the URL</font>

338
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:28,830
into into into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source code so what</font>

339
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:32,850
the system does even use a machine

340
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,259
learning to understand whether this<font color="#CCCCCC"> java</font>

341
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,059
skippy you now is

342
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,790
actually a valid in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kidal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> compromised or</font>

343
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:42,478
not and yet what it does use different

344
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,858
features for that i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure if you</font>

345
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:46,109
lie experiment<font color="#CCCCCC"> when she learning so i</font>

346
00:16:43,859 --> 00:16:47,309
want to go mentally good too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much in the</font>

347
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:51,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">tail but you want to give you some</font>

348
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:53,399
insight of our algorithm work so we have

349
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,379
five different features that allow to

350
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,619
discriminate<font color="#CCCCCC"> weather indicator of</font>

351
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:02,970
compromises is valid or invalid so the

352
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:06,809
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> feature is a page similarity so</font>

353
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:09,419
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is that attackers we often</font>

354
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,970
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same template when we do face a</font>

355
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:14,339
page this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very common for example for</font>

356
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,880
hacking group that they use the same

357
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,500
methodology no matters we use the same

358
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">advanced a template to advertise very</font>

359
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromised so the page very compromised</font>

360
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:28,230
one of the compromise a page we often

361
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,570
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the layout they use is similar so</font>

362
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,549
they have often you know the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> battle</font>

363
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,830
like we have no facebook and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter</font>

364
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,730
button pointing to the hacking group

365
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:42,269
website just to be towed<font color="#CCCCCC"> vert eyes</font>

366
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,279
wherever defacement where the names of a

367
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:49,679
hell<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a member of a hacking group map</font>

368
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:53,629
and or you can have like groups that do

369
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,129
that do the face<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for a specific</font>

370
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:58,080
will specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal like for fishing for</font>

371
00:17:56,129 --> 00:18:01,350
example so in that case they all contain

372
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,178
the same fishing kit so we look for out

373
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:08,070
of this page between strand from<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

374
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:10,590
path we look for the similarity of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

375
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:14,189
page<font color="#CCCCCC"> that includes our our indicator of</font>

376
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:17,250
compromise so here we use SSD / which is

377
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:20,760
a is an algorithm pleat the similarity

378
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,830
between a viscous<font color="#E5E5E5"> web pages it use the</font>

379
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,840
fashioning algorithm of doing it so what

380
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,928
we do we compete with stage IV rd

381
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,449
between this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 pages pages and we use</font>

382
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:34,049
this value as one of a feature for our

383
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:37,919
Father algorithm my second feature we

384
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:39,330
use is a maliciousness as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

385
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,190
indicator most of its indicator

386
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise are normally benign but</font>

387
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're often including pages which are</font>

388
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,229
malicious

389
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,629
so if out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 web pages</font>

390
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:54,110
including our indicators if some of them

391
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,790
are malicious so most likely also all

392
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other malicious and medicated</font>

393
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,200
compromises valid so what we do we

394
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:05,900
automatically query for a google

395
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:07,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">safebrowsing virustotal and the</font>

396
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,860
reputation system of a company i work on

397
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,830
to see whether these pages are

398
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:16,959
malaysians not and we use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number as</font>

399
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:21,980
one of a of a feature for our

400
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,930
classification algorithm we then look

401
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,930
whatever there is an anomalous origin

402
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,930
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean it mean that we often</font>

403
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,830
find out that attackers instead of using

404
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the JavaScript for simple technique</font>

405
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading instead of using the URL of the</font>

406
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,820
official like<font color="#CCCCCC"> jQuery domain what we do</font>

407
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:46,100
they take a creative a source code they

408
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,830
downloaded by uploading somewhere else

409
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,409
usually in a for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example web server but</font>

410
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:55,370
very compromised in Russia or cranial

411
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:57,440
and they asked their code there ok so

412
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,850
the code itself is exactly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

413
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the original code but instead of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

414
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">the official URL they use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one this</font>

415
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,129
is used because if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font>

416
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,070
changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code they can easily do</font>

417
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,530
the change on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code own website on</font>

418
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:15,320
their domain and automatic all the page

419
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,990
will never compromise will basically

420
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,490
lower these changes so what we do we

421
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:25,220
look whatever is that whatever they and

422
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:27,320
they URL which is loaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with</font>

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,350
now it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this bottom at allow</font>

431
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,160
you to each piece jolivet allow you to

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:57,860
create this battle like for an<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like or</font>

433
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,350
like a share on<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook this kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

434
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,409
computer i'll use so it's very rare that

435
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,629
they are used by only by the attacker so

436
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,570
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to flag that as indicator</font>

437
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:10,130
of compromise when when we look for sec

438
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">i will not make you wait for security</font>

439
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:16,010
forums so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you know somebody has</font>

440
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:20,540
already discussed about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that specific</font>

441
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:22,879
URL so we query for<font color="#E5E5E5"> villa and the list</font>

442
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,159
of keywords like hack the face to

443
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,970
compromise as soon as so forth to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

444
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:32,540
if somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else has already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

445
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:37,010
about that specific URL so we use five

446
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:39,740
these five features what we use a

447
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,720
framework called<font color="#E5E5E5"> waken which is a</font>

448
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:46,200
framework for machine learning

449
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:50,340
we use a wake up on a training data of

450
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:54,419
formal for a total of modern free under

451
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:57,928
unique candidate and we do clustering of

452
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:59,429
our based on our training data so what

453
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:03,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean it means that we build</font>

454
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:07,620
basically free cluster categories so out

455
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:09,120
of all the JavaScript URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we strive</font>

456
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,729
for more training data we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have three</font>

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,219
groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> both on better use the ID</font>

458
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,549

avatar on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> side because we didn't</font>

461
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:26,070
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information usually this is</font>

462
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:29,570
the case when im mean path does not give

463
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:31,950
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough pages to run the algorithm to</font>

464
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:35,330
from doing that we use an unsupervised

465
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:38,039
learning algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> i called the k-means</font>

466
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,678
this case we use the values of k equal<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8</font>

467
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:43,470
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working good so so at the end</font>

468
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:47,280
of that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically this free big</font>

469
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:50,159
cluster<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok what happened then we went</font>

470
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:53,549
live with the tool so what starting from

471
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the middle me or the tool does on every</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript URL using a system and</font>

475
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,990
they look for distance so basically tell

476
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,120
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript URL it's very</font>

477
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">closer to the malicious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cluster so it's</font>

478
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,590
most likely malicious this diversity red

479
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,900
is very close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the benign cluster so</font>

480
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's most likely benign so Eddie do it</font>

481
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:25,470
on the real time ok so in average we

482
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:28,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">strat 2.5 indicator of compromise per</font>

485
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:39,270
hundred candidates and turn over 22 were

486
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:42,480
benign and briefly roughly under them

487
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:45,090
were actually malicious and interesting

488
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,100
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of them were</font>

489
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,470
previously ever unknown complete the

490
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,090
node by traditional AV so like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> a coin</font>

491
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">for virustotal nobody know about them</font>

492
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,610
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the worm is classified as benign</font>

493
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,919
one of reason is because one fourth of a

494
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,470
visa 100 a malicious indicator we were

495
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,370
actually used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> visual effects like</font>

496
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:13,260
moving text in the page or<font color="#CCCCCC"> vis knowing</font>

497
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:15,299
effect the kind of things but we cause

498
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,549
if we actually verified everywhere only

499
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:21,090
use the malicious context so we were not

500
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:24,389
used in any benign page so give us a

501
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">go-between to the more detail here so</font>

502
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:29,130
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a plot about the lifetime of</font>

503
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:30,750
malicious indicators so as you can see

504
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:34,710
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are like the majority of them have</font>

505
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,940
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifetime of less than 150 days that</font>

506
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,370
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have been around just for a</font>

507
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,770
couple of months but there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

508
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">em would have been around for for like a</font>

509
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:46,100
three hundred days on one year or two

510
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,928
years or more than two years and

511
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,908
interestingly enough ten percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

512
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:54,690
video conference were hosted a Google

513
00:24:50,909 --> 00:24:55,890
Drive or Google Code Slyke okay well you

514
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:58,080
know I was expecting that we were

515
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,419
hosting<font color="#E5E5E5"> women and said in denying it</font>

516
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,000
compromised web server in Russia or

517
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,340
someone else but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pair of em</font>

518
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually also done on Google drivin</font>

519
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:12,120
and code be sure that it's very

520
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to detect such JavaScript</font>

521
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,199
because job which itself is actually

522
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,260
benign and the one of these were online

523
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,169
for over two years and the last time I

524
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,360
checked it was still used by those of

525
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:26,010
the face website so this website they

526
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,320
are all the face by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same aching</font>

527
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,679
group and they're all including the same

528
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,950
JavaScript which involves you know

529
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:38,490
Austin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google same time she was also</font>

530
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">used for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drive-by for formality for</font>

531
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:44,899
web modeling factions so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me now give</font>

532
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,029
you some example what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found the tool</font>

533
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:50,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the system resistant actually still</font>

534
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:53,789
running so we have constantly find new

535
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:56,580
things here so one of the common things

536
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:58,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you find is web shells so because</font>

537
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,870
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like compromised one of the</font>

538
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,120
first things recover bad guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> to based</font>

539
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:06,989
on a web shell to keep like persistence

540
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,580
on the compromised machine we fought we

541
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,330
have several cases of password-protected

542
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,790
log

543
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:15,300
so we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript that mean age</font>

544
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:20,520
all that together with a capture and

545
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:22,740
like custom capture and and so this was

546
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,120
automatically flag as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> van in decatur</font>

547
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:30,000
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar system whenever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there are</font>

548
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,360
different cases of his heir 57a shall

549
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,730
see later show before this is a very

550
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">common as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is a way</font>

551
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that occurred due to basically</font>

552
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:43,940
acknowledge the fact that their tool

553
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:47,070
that we use for mass defacement

554
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:49,830
efficiently they faced a web application

555
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:53,790
and to keep track of which application

556
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:57,899
we have defaced<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have 15 more</font>

557
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:59,550
minutes but small enough and i would

558
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,290
tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> something about this air 57</font>

559
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,330
actually I found out it or if you are

560
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:07,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">aware that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shares were actually</font>

561
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:09,689
back toward so if you are you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad</font>

562
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,060
guy okay you go on their side you don't

563
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,610
know the web show you use your web shell

564
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:17,220
here hey your attacks and then way web

565
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,919
shell itself is basically back door and

566
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:23,190
this back this allow like the bad guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

567
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:27,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the guys behind the development of his f</font>

568
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">57 shells to connect to the machine that</font>

569
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:36,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason but other people have compromised</font>

570
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and another common habit for</font>

571
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:46,889
attackers is to install fishing kit

572
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:49,430
because fishing kit is very easy way to

573
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:54,600
automated fishing is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy way to</font>

574
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:56,250
get money out of them of the face so

575
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,510
what we normally use values like fishing

576
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:02,370
kit that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ready to use so we</font>

577
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:06,360
found a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fishing kit for web made</font>

578
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:08,459
portals of<font color="#E5E5E5"> america online and yahoo so</font>

579
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,459
in this case they were using like the

580
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,010
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript files and for</font>

581
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,780
rendering the page and when i say

582
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,720
original it means better the file and

583
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,820
also the location route so like the

584
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,740
domain of this javascript file were

585
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,020
actually the official alternately

586
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,160
domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the automatic online as you</font>

587
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:31,230
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in rent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first line</font>

588
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,450
so I'm pretty proud of a system that was

589
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:37,590
able actually to identify these<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

590
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:43,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases and I will do it we do the fact</font>

591
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:45,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there were like multiple a website</font>

592
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:50,250
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> were being compromised by the same</font>

593
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:53,610
gang and such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a UCI logistic calm and</font>

594
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:55,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">fern and whatever calm so this is</font>

595
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,540
automatically flag that is bad because

596
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:01,170
you have actually multiple domain and

597
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:03,480
domain that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different by the domain</font>

598
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,690
that first domain fair american line

599
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,640
cbn.com and that's something real

600
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,380
because you know if you have a web

601
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,690
portal for america online and use a

602
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,160
junkie from medical nine normally also a

603
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,860
web portal should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> austin american</font>

604
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,800
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a subdomain of medical line and</font>

605
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,449
this was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

606
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">beautiful upcycled by the same group of</font>

607
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:28,260
different domains and this was one

608
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,510
feature our classifier that's why it's

609
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,390
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> shown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the system works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

610
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:35,910
currently flag all these indicate

611
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:39,750
torrents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and malicious as a valid</font>

612
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:43,520
indicator of compromise but another way

613
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:46,830
to make easy money for criminals is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

614
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,570
what's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> affiliate programs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i</font>

615
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,928
guess you all know how an affiliate

616
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:55,230
program works and so for example a case

617
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:58,230
of this URL this URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your elevated</font>

618
00:29:55,230 --> 00:30:00,980
tool to a javascript that has been

619
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,870
installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a lot of the face web pages</font>

620
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:06,660
but we collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> from our web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipod so</font>

621
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:08,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a traffic redirection system for</font>

622
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,250
affiliate programs what doesn't mean

623
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:14,880
mean that all all the victim that<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit</font>

624
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:18,360
the face pages they get redirected to

625
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,300
another site ok that will collect the

626
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,479
visit and the bad guys we get actually

627
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,190
some revenue out of the visits<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

628
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,790
basically they still the cliq always

629
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:32,210
steal the visit of legitimate unanimity

630
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,210
users

631
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:40,179
so on top of that interestingly visceral

632
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:45,130
is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> low data at client side by a</font>

633
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:48,550
malware called visa<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm with something</font>

634
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:51,370
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later and it's also another</font>

635
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:54,159
way to know to automate or exploit this

636
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:56,889
affiliate campaign system and using the

637
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,500
telemetry in our av we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that</font>

638
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:02,500
roughly there are 600 new infected users

639
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:06,250
per day so this threat is still ongoing

640
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:10,870
and actually we are the first one to

641
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:13,210
uncover fat fat on top of using this

642
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:17,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript client side by malware was</font>

643
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:20,740
the bad guy did they also use with

644
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript at server side as the traffic</font>

645
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:26,170
read an actual system similar to Wed

646
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">varies with a fake charity program from</font>

647
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:31,990
a direction to<font color="#CCCCCC"> load organ so if you go</font>

648
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:34,379
this side they claim to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very least</font>

649
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:39,250
it like a shopping site such as Amazon

650
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:41,350
but you can actually not bad but if you

651
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,230
want donation tool you can shop for

652
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,240
anything like anyone from ite or

653
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:51,790
whatever and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically claimed that</font>

654
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,679
part of the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other of what</font>

655
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,750
you of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you spend there will be</font>

656
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,240
delayed to american red cross at the

657
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:01,600
bunch of other like charity program

658
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:05,770
which is clearly too low and so we found

659
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">this you now in in our as indicator of</font>

660
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:12,429
compromise and this is this was loaded

661
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:14,559
at runtime as BHO browser helper object

662
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:18,790
interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> laura by a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Manuel</font>

663
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:21,520
families and we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> verified</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aware like</font>

664
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,500
over 600 about 6,000 infection per day

665
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is similar to the previous</font>

666
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,630
one so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> job this JavaScript was also</font>

667
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:31,720
installed<font color="#E5E5E5"> server-side on compromise web</font>

668
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:34,059
pages so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy dehydration</font>

669
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,010
tool they were using both they know a

670
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:40,120
client-side approach like a marvel to

671
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:44,410
collect visits as much as

672
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:46,179
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said like the face pages and</font>

673
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:49,690
traffic generation system at<font color="#CCCCCC"> server-side</font>

674
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:53,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to collect visit so like a two ways of</font>

675
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:57,880
better you know exploiting stealing

676
00:32:53,650 --> 00:33:01,810
clicks from legitimate users but another

677
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,780
case our mailers so this very common as

678
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:07,090
well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the bad guys do here the</font>

679
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,310
compromise aside and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they turn the</font>

680
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:15,300
compromise side into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam amazing</font>

681
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:18,940
server they<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually do using like</font>

682
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:23,440
phpmailer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tomatoes meeting PHP on</font>

683
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:26,830
another web code and this is an

684
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,930
alternative<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of installing means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

685
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:31,980
alternative to ballot to hosting

686
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:34,900
providers that are commonly used as well

687
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:39,060
to use this awesome provider usually

688
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:41,380
located in east of Europe or to use a

689
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:46,330
bottoming photo machine but also another

690
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:48,490
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a spam but very common is</font>

691
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,159
also to use compromised website so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

692
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,680
found a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of his talents of commerce</font>

693

website<font color="#E5E5E5"> installed with a primary version</font>

694
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,560
to which we found out to be like a peach

695
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:01,710
familiar Britain Russia and sold

696

00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:10,659
this kinda stole<font color="#CCCCCC"> use copies of jQuery</font>

698
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:12,400
but in this crazy jquery was the ocean

00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:17,918
water on service Jake Reed was also

700
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:20,409
google and tumblr and and this was

701
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,949
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> were unmodified copy of popular</font>

of this popular library which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

703
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:31,178
was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult for our classifier to</font>

704
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,980
confess malicious because the jQuery was

705
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:35,950
a legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> jquery was austin on google</font>

706
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:38,980
and so on but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end which was</font>

707
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:40,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">classified as malicious and the entire</font>

couple of websites and have been

00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:45,159
compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> by this gang and we when</font>

710
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:48,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually classified as my indicator of</font>

711
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:51,669
compromise of course our system is not

712
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,619
perfect that's important to say we think

713
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:56,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the approach we use a kind of</font>

714
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:59,020
alternative approach to existing

715
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,770
solution like a system<font color="#E5E5E5"> at look at the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">content instead what we do here we don't</font>

718
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,098
the way in which the attackers made use

719
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,270
of their javascript in which form for

720
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:15,160
that reason there are some division

721
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:17,680
technique so the file that attacker can

722
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,868
use like inline code so can embed<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

723
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the code in line invalid the face pages</font>

724
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:25,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">rubberband referencing the external</font>

725
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,730
component and the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

726
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">also use one time generated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs so</font>

727
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,819
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they in fact a new machine</font>

728
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:36,460
they could actually julv include can be

729
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:39,609
generated in a different form<font color="#E5E5E5"> every time</font>

730
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,200
a kind of DG at server side and there

731
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:46,328
should be something that they're already

732
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,339
doing a server-side TG to conclude<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

733
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:50,410
think what we did here we introduce this

734
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:53,799
concept of<font color="#CCCCCC"> web indicator</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise and</font>

735
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:57,058
actually we have the system in place and

736
00:35:53,799 --> 00:35:59,799
that use open source technology to

737
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:04,000
detect valid indicator of compromise and

738
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:06,280
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty helpful in detecting website</font>

739
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,920
that have been compromised by<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

740
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,549
example the same hacking group including

741
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">safety use for a fishing or two for</font>

742
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:19,509
affiliate programs as much for

743
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:23,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">installing a drive-by downloads and we</font>

744
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:26,410
also use this indicator of compromise

745
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,740
together with HTTP referer to discover

746
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:31,240
compromised pages on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back end</font>

747
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:36,620
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what we are doing</font>

748
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:38,910
now and and we also do it for doing

749
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:43,140
investigative analysis like when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

750
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:45,180
to understand what's the surface of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

751
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,700
specific hacking group using this

752
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,040
technique we can understand you know if

753
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,279
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> group of many website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

754
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:57,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">faced where are they located why they do</font>

755
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,430
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> face mentor not with type of</font>

756
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,620
salad<font color="#CCCCCC"> very target so when we can like</font>

757
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,470
really doing intelligence operation and

758
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:08,940
stand the surface of these groups that's

759
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:10,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">very helpful hope you like we talked and</font>

760
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,440
buy whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions you can</font>

761
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:18,290
just reach me out i will be around today
