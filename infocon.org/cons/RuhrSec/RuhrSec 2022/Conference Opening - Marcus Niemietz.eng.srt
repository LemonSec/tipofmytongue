2
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:14,059
thank you

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,939
okay so good morning everyone full room

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,699
nice to see you again

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,740
welcome to the fifth edition of wars

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,599
that gets a little bit rude right okay

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,180
so I'm once again happy to have you here

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,640
after the relatively long covid-19 break

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,739
um for about two years and we are back

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,680
again this time with one year and a

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,860
little bit more safety here because we

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,739
have a mass requirements and the desks

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,059
so

14
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,360
um but I think our plan worked out

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,460
so first of all I just want to introduce

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,800
you one slider bar at our company who's

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,739
organizing this conference so there's a

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,420
little bit of advertisement

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,120
the point is that when we were founded

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,339
in 2014 and this is actually the history

21
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,860
of wool sec

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,979
um we started on the left hand side

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,860
and the building where we were sitting

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,740
was about five minutes away by foot

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,860
nowadays we are near the Central Station

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,880
of bohon on the right picture and

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,000
um what we actually do is we we do

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,560
penetration tests within the web

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
security field within the cryptography

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,939
field we have security trainings

31
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,960
and all of the stuff around security

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,780
and one thing which fits very well into

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,540
the water concept is also our pro bono

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,299
concept so we have the possibility

35
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,020
to offer pro bono penetration tests for

36
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,360
non-commercial applications so in case

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,700
that you have a non-commercial

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,000
application you can write us contact us

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,579
and be a part within our list of

40
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,939
candidates you know so if you like you

41
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,799
can be pen tested for free in case that

42
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,360
you have a non-commercial application

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,560
with high impact

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,660
then I want to shed some light on the

45
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,840
eurobit security Summit 2022

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,120
which is an event where russec is

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,040
integrated in

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
the eurobit Summit is an event or a set

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,020
of events including events like the

50
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,520
European security startup Awards the its

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,900
connect is one of the largest

52
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,360
expositions for I.T security students

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,060
which was here yesterday and for example

54
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,660
the eurobits woman Academy tomorrow so a

55
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,340
whole week of our two security starting

56
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,180
from Monday till tomorrow or on Friday

57
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,099
and this event wouldn't of course be

58
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,860
possible without once again the sponsors

59
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,860
and supporters thank you very much

60
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,200
um thanks to G data you know starting

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,660
from the beginning

62
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,580
Huawei VM Ray

63
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,540
Vietnam

64
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,040
and Cube 5.

65
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,900
they allowed us to keep the ticket price

66
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,599
as low as possible

67
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,620
and that's quite a nice thing thank you

68
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,739
then have a look at the program

69
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,780
we start with the opening phase but we

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,120
are currently in in row one

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,819
then we will have a talk from Sebastian

72
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,280
wood and bench stock and afterwards a

73
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,620
coffee break of half an hour hopefully

74
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,220
with some a good nice coffee

75
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,799
then two talks again and the lunch

76
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,379
session the lunch is upstairs in the

77
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,599
mensar and you can pay your lunch your

78
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,060
food your drinks with your coupon within

79
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,819
the envelope okay so just show the

80
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,459
coupon and you can get your lunch for

81
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,640
free

82
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,700
afterwards we will have two talks again

83
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,640
and then a coffee break which is a

84
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,680
little bit longer so 15 minutes more

85
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,599
from 3 P.M to 3 45. and the reason why

86
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,700
we are doing this is to keep some music

87
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,799
tradition alive and this tradition is

88
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,560
actually that we have a group photo a

89
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,680
group picture displayed here so we meet

90
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,440
again upstairs here it's two floors

91
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,020
above us hopefully if a river is good

92
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,300
and make a group picture to keep this

93
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,040
event in mind if you like yeah

94
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,060
after the group picture after the coffee

95
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,180
break we have two talks again and that's

96
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,720
basically it so some some very very good

97
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,960
topics about it security from very very

98
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,740
good speakers I think

99
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,660
and at 7 15 we have the G data evening

100
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,320
event so we start from here and drive

101
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,100
here by car or for example by train so

102
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,220
in case that you've got a ticket you can

103
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,900
take the train

104
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,580
um

105
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,139
use the train here from Vu 35 to Versace

106
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,800
it's about a five minutes Drive

107
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
and this is the address here I think

108
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,199
it's also um written down on the paper

109
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,940
sheets

110
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,039
and as I told you

111
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,039
we have some safety requirements so we

112
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,780
you must wear a medicine medical mask

113
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,360
but it's not required in case that you

114
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,880
are eating or drinking still even here

115
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,259
so but it gets us a little bit more of

116
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,820
safety

117
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,400
and that's basically it

118
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,080
for reopening

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,259
as always enjoy this event get some new

120
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,600
knowledge talk to each other talk to the

121
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,280
speakers talk to the attendees talk to

122
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,840
the other people

123
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,139
