1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,330
for next yr

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,300
exciting talk I Cup

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,059
entitled hell to talk to the press and
us even

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,329
CAS welcome I want that

5
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:21,529
sees maybe he readers about say 10 times
and the people who came to this

6
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,249
topping the first gave it the last a
conference h2k to and because they did

7
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:26,659
it was a

8
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:31,720
well as through track and conferences
and I think about look for people's

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,489
my sissy more people here the reason why
I did the talk

10
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,510
a.m. was because im in the course my
work I end up talking to a lot of people

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,390
about a lot of technical subjects

12
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,129
and I even also a policy subject to load
BusinessObjects

13
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,989
and people tend to make the same errors
over and over again

14
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,289
and they really couldn't make it much
better fist up getting their point

15
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:53,940
across

16
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,699
getting into print which is what I do on
to broadcast which other people do

17
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:01,460
if they understood maybe a few the rules
and understood some of the

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,440
expectations what journalists do and how
stories get formed

19
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,200
and and so on so I write for IEEE
Spectrum magazine which is the flagship

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,820
publication are them

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,200
the IEEE to arstan is work to do a lot
of

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,460
and just regular supportive engineering
publication work

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,030
and it's pretty good place to work for
because as a non-profit

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,940
we can and as an international
non-profit our internal organization

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,240
half as many different views were not
locked into one corporate view

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,479
we often have a lot of people would
really do care deeply about making the

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,260
world a better place to technology

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,780
so I found a good good place to work our
current issue is a

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,850
is this one says our nation which has a
nice story about

30
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,090
Vernor Vinge about what it's like a
legitimately to live in a and a

31
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,350
completely surveillance

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,110
a society where everybody has got it
sensors a low themselves everybody's

33
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,430
experience reality is mediated cell
anybody want to copy of that a few

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,450
appear so course I'm here to tell you
that really tell your friends

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,730
when well we all know that the impact
the truth is that we're not your friends

36
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,239
many times how many people here have
seen an

37
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,780
at the movie almost famous okay

38
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,210
what are they called the press in that
movie the enemy they I S right they

39
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,100
always refer to as the enemy

40
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,280
and when people for Ghana that the press
this post for the enemy

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,350
that's where people start getting hurt
and feeling betrayed and there's all

42
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,440
this back and forth

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,230
and journalists are not your friends
when a journalist comes to that may be

44
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,910
very nice to be very charming

45
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,100
they may be very pleasant they may be a
pain in the ass whatever it is

46
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,930
but they have a very specific agenda
they want to be able to write the story

47
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,010
that will interest to readers AST now on
a story means very specific things

48
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,640
they're not there to not their scholars
not running academic histories

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,800
not there to write your biography
they're not even their necessary to be

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,760
activists and take up your cause

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,899
you tell them they're looking for a nice
story that they can tell

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,970
stories of intent have narratives so
they're looking so

53
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,060
day maybe a hundred things there that
are into it at Nichole interesting

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,900
they're really looking first at
something and they can play a

55
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,040
international package

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,359
has a beginning a middle and an end has
nice characters all our stories don't

57
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,290
fit that mold

58
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,590
are well a lot of things the real world
up don't fit that mold

59
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,890
you really mean you're talking to a
journalist try and think

60
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,170
you know I might am I giving a story
here am I telling things the story

61
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,750
or am I just basie tell the kinda stuff
that's more appropriate to

62
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,330
a text book or a chapter you know in
some

63
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,160
academic report generally speaking
journalists are looking for a story

64
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,530
if you can help them find a story you'll
go very much the top of the list of

65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,810
things that they're going to write about

66
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,720
am your point about this again is
expectations

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,560
I've had I've talked to people to bring
them up to talk to

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,550
15-30 minutes which is about the normal
time you talked some night this

69
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,980
and they they come at a very know it to
find mild you know

70
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,209
I did they weren't in the article at all
all the recorder for couple clients

71
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,400
a.m. most is the time to point at the
interview is not about

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,390
you journalist talk to you for two
reasons usually

73
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,819
one is they're looking for a quote a
reaction a comment

74
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,610
this usually only applies if you're in
an organization which is reacting to

75
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,319
something

76
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,409
so happens a journalist will call you up
some event has happened

77
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:22,599
the journalists will call you up for
reaction and you give a couple of lines

78
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,219
and those lines per usual pre-match
appeared to be a

79
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:28,748
and that Jerry the only happens assay
with large organizations who are already

80
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:30,430
involved in ongoing

81
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,919
usually mature story where they really
just do what the couple the lines the

82
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,109
quick response

83
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,389
most the time and I suspect most people
in this audience are being interviewed

84
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:43,129
the journalist is not looking for that
what they're looking for his help

85
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,840
understanding a topic they're doing

86
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,599
research so the more you can help them
understand a topic

87
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:52,460
the better even if you know your words
don't appear necessary imprint

88
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,909
when you look at a news story are a
feature story and you see

89
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:59,688
all these particular fax it to mention
this story will not get something for me

90
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:03,759
information anecdotes they're not
necessary attributed to anybody

91
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,659
chances are the journalists got that
because somebody told them

92
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:11,129
but yet not everybody is quoted not
everybody is attributed

93
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:14,139
generally speaking they're only going to
want

94
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,439
you know the handful a coat a really
interesting that really pic added detail

95
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:22,710
and in a story the reason for this is
because journalists are supposed to be

96
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,120
loyal to their readers before their
sources

97
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,749
and again this comes back point
journalists are not your friends

98
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:32,189
they're not supposed to be it's a
journalist is your friend over be over

99
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:32,749
over

100
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:36,699
your loyalty jules is loyalty to you
over loyalty the reader that's not a

101
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:39,020
journalist were tweeting

102
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,520
they're not supposed to be your friends
when they do cross a line when that we

103
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,830
start and that's when you start hearing
stories about your patrons

104
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,430
all they wouldn't write something about
that person because they know that

105
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,159
person their friend if that person

106
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:53,969
and that's when you as a third person as
a reader you get annoyed about that

107
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:57,520
that journals yet the fact remains is
when your source in that happens you

108
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,109
don't see anything wrong with it and you

109
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,680
back you can't expect because he's your
friend so that's not the point

110
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,699
journalists are not supposed to be loyal
to you this post be loyal

111
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,279
to the readers they're also loyal to
another or to another group and that's

112
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,020
our organization

113
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,770
it's right and this is why put their
palms media consolidation is unfair to

114
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,609
expect

115
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,210
journalists to write stuff that are
going to get themselves farkas just

116
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,270
doesn't happen and expecting that a
journalist is going to do that is an

117
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,740
unrealistic expectation

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,930
that's why it's important to have lotsa
voices in the media

119
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,249
because everybody has a blind spot their
clients by disorganization

120
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:35,020
I work for the IEEE what are the chances
that I am going to write an article that

121
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,409
says technology is bad

122
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,789
very very very slim now I have applied
technology I personally think it's a

123
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,180
good thing but even if I didn't

124
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,849
because I'm ready for the IEEE they're
not going to be too true if I if I start

125
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:47,539
me up

126
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:51,020
writing articles that say electoral
technologies evil

127
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,270
and we shouldn't use emotional go back
to you know planning firms Michael last

128
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,799
for long nap take their job

129
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,069
every journalist has a blind spot it's
their own organization should beware

130
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,499
to when there when they're talking them
and all this comes back to

131
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:06,110
the main point of this article which is
you need to tailor what you're saying

132
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,809
to the person you're talking to and also
to that person that they will be talking

133
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:10,379
to

134
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,180
ultimately to their audience so why
should bother talking to us what I've

135
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,770
you know to claim is really a 0.2
Schmucks people who will listen to you

136
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,399
who will

137
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,619
betrayal to target your trust apparently
betray you

138
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:25,909
the write articles which you know have
various you know

139
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:29,300
non objective blind spots why bother

140
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,009
well the press is a really good we're
getting your message out to a lot of

141
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,259
people

142
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,939
and and that's why that's why we get
that's why press people get privileges

143
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:40,939
even this this conference that's why
they get free entry that's why they get

144
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:43,309
my seats because the idea is

145
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:46,819
through journalist you can reach a much
wider audience than you could

146
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,289
talking alone and to a journalist you
reach a different audience

147
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,389
many people say well CNN it's great we
have less serves

148
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,399
we have web pages we can reach people
that way

149
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,879
well no because unless people have 10
have to come to you

150
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,969
most journalists are working for systems
that they're they're basically push

151
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:03,879
systems

152
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,539
I write a magazine echoes at 380,000
people worldwide

153
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:10,568
people who would not necessary even know
about your website to go to

154
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:13,809
so that's why it's worthwhile talking to
people

155
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,490
I should also say that you know a lot
about things are said about the media

156
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,020
a lot about justified but don't think
that the media is among us

157
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,189
the tends to be BP the situation whereby
people say

158
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:27,479
the media and then the image that popped
into people's had a system

159
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,808
Bazaar amalgam of Rupert Murdoch and CNN
and cable news and

160
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,149
all this kind of stuff there are many
media outlets

161
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,380
even some the mainstream that you can
get a fair shake it

162
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,929
a good example of this which was always
price people until they really readers

163
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,479
The Wall Street Journal

164
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,899
la pena The Wall Street Journal is very
if you look at the op-ed pages

165
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,920
Michael oh my this this is more
ideologically driven and say

166
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,009
you know Fox News or something like that
if you look at the op-ed pages which is

167
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:57,529
for a lot of people will do to get the
time magazine

168
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,370
but if you actually read the journalism
that goes into the rest that paper

169
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,120
I have to say Astley is among the most
insightful and balanced reporting

170
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,240
around it really is worth so there's no
an example of an organization we hear

171
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,290
Wall Street Journal

172
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,730
and you you have a certain image of them
but actually they're reporters

173
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,019
really good reporters there editors
really good were editors

174
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:21,730
they often do surprisingly you're bound
story surprisingly inside the stores

175
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,410
but not in a venue you would expect so
even if you think that journalists

176
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,420
schmuck

177
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,920
even if you think they're working for
schmuck your organization it still offer

178
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,860
worth your while

179
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,170
talked a.m. there are also different
types adjourns that should be aware of

180
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,439
in terms of who is worth talking to

181
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,569
there featureless and their sure general
journalists

182
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:45,050
general journalists will often be you
know you people working your daily

183
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,100
newspaper they may not know an awful lot
about a particular subject

184
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,769
they might cover you know yes it might
have been covering you know

185
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,970
Mayor Bloomberg cigarette banner simple
and today they're covering you know some

186
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,360
technical event

187
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,889
they offer a car that more had her
helping but again they do get to general

188
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:04,209
magellan's the other types of
journalists would be are feature lists

189
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:07,230
you know these are often people who try
to specialize in an area

190
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,899
and and get involved in stuff but again
they often tend to write more

191
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:10,920
specialized

192
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,560
publications themselves am when the
crash is a PP people ask it last time

193
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,160
and it did this is how you get a
journalist attention am

194
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,180
first up never send an email I cat

195
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,250
you know twenty or thirty press release
today

196
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,459
and that's including you know plus the
ones that actually subscribed to an

197
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,930
action want to get the press releases

198
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,339
you know it's just it just never hits
noise filter in fact most the time you

199
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,240
know my my

200
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,449
then mail filters were just filter I was
joking I don't even see it

201
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:43,370
don't send a press release your best
thing to do if you want to get a

202
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,370
journalist attention is to snail mail a
letter

203
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,970
and this action boss you doing research
if you have a point of view you want to

204
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,440
get across re-invent

205
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,699
or you're annoyed about something and
you think something has gone terribly

206
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:55,670
wrong

207
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,519
and you want to bring some attention to
it too little bit of research have a

208
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,399
lock

209
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,509
at you know what what organizations
career that and then go

210
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,060
and use their go to the web-sites a
little research and find out what

211
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,110
people cover that and then write a
letter

212
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,360
to that particular journalist you know
dear jim: blogs I know your story on

213
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
you know great computing aware happens
to be you might also be interested in

214
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:19,300
this

215
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,620
and here's include press release so
really

216
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,019
and I get so few physical letters when I
get a physical letter for sockets

217
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,860
persistent sits on my desk

218
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,000
that letter gets so much more tension

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,139
any kind email would get email really is
is

220
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:38,980
unsolicited e-mail sir is really dead
sir

221
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,740
faxes of what slightly better than the
male slightly better in the mail

222
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,720
but again I get a whole bunch of access
and I sit there and I go to my go to my

223
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,910
you know pigeon holes I pull out my
mailing your must scrap

224
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,160
and iPod out I got a whole bunch a fax
crappy fax paper

225
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,120
and you know looking under any I very
quickly make a decision if you write

226
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,680
a letter you know address that person
they will guaranteed said to me the

227
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,259
whole thing

228
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,389
whereas if I get something looks like a
presley's I will usually skim the first

229
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:07,569
couple lines

230
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:10,899
and that and then my decision is made
often just just literally within five

231
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:11,540
seconds

232
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,969
recycling urgently read the whole thing
right down to the your sincerely

233
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,000
am your thing you should do when you do
send a press release

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,910
is make sure you have contact details
it's really nice to be do you have a

235
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,930
website

236
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,920
as a measurement that the Hannah thank
you have high quality high resolution

237
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,219
photographs that website

238
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,629
that's great because oftentimes the
deadlines are approaching your tractor

239
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:34,009
needs and copying they need to
photograph it's great if the

240
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:37,449
if they have your photograph to use
because it well first off that they're

241
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,550
difficult to contact you see three know
that

242
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,920
they're covering your your subject and
secondly it's your photographs you've

243
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,259
gotten your choice

244
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,540
a viewfinder across this photograph
should not just be high resolution my

245
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,790
lawn lamp when I first set this I said
he lied

246
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,870
you could forecast that doesn't just
mean you know 300 dots per inch image

247
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,790
that actually means good photographs and
not everybody who can operated digital

248
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,449
camera knows all the submenus and

249
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:07,009
you know her hook it up to turn to
webcam is a good photographer

250
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:10,889
and you know you really if you're going
to if you're seriously gonna sir

251
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,480
publicity campaign

252
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,740
find someone really does good photograph
talk be work maybe two student

253
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,459
your friend in he's actually doing in
congress something that might get them

254
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,850
to your photographs

255
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,120
for you and because you know if it's
gonna get big flashing red eyes or it's

256
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,360
washed out

257
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,569
UK camp used but if you give if you
can't give

258
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:34,360
a news organization something they can
use that's relevant to them

259
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,370
they'll be more than happy to use it
like a a picture's worth 1000 words

260
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,480
am

261
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,530
again also another thing that that
journalists are interested in

262
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:53,270
is to really try to help them put a big
pot you know what's the hot across the

263
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,040
big picture

264
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,750
you know if you could write up a new cat
lol we're having this big protest

265
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,460
against

266
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,690
you know the DCMA I'm wearing his big
protest a freak event

267
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,710
well you've gotta tell 'em a little bit
more than that why is it important

268
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,330
and if you can although it is often a
lot of work you might want to do this in

269
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,730
in the letter to the Presleys

270
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,260
tell tailored specifically to the
organization if there was somebody

271
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,220
writing for The Wall Street Journal you
might want to emphasize well

272
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,740
we're protesting and suffer patents
because we think suffer patten's retard

273
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,270
innovation and review means we lose out
to the europeans because they've decided

274
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,660
not to suffer patten's

275
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,110
and you know discrete problem for us
that's a good thing to talk to them

276
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,520
if you're talking to another
organization other newspaper Village

277
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,640
Voice or something maybe it's some maybe
not there then you stress what this is

278
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,980
about first amendment rights

279
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,660
is gonna take away this particular law
this particular stage is gonna take my

280
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,670
summer freedom of expression give them
the big picture

281
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,150
because they're not going to understand
it if it if their bid beat reporter

282
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,670
they might be able to connect the dots
you can't assume they're gonna do that

283
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,180
you need to give them the context need
to tell them for some reason

284
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,190
why they should comment cover your story
another twenty other news releases that

285
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,170
they've gone that day

286
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,870
what are the other beyond stories that
are clamoring for attention

287
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,500
is really a pressing problem now last
couple years have been really bad years

288
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,340
for certainly the print industry I think
probably general broadcast broadcasting

289
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,890
as well

290
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,689
mine agassi has gone down from eighty
pages have editorial 240 pages

291
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,650
editorial so the competition to get in
to get a story and when those pages has

292
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,260
effectively double you know it's really
tough to get in and that's across the

293
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:26,750
board

294
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,040
so you know York you are competing
against a lot of people you have to tell

295
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,329
them

296
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,980
don't think they're just gonna know you
have to tell them why

297
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,740
the covering your story as well as the
details your particular

298
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,440
story am when it comes time to

299
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,830
actually you know you've got the
journal's attention or maybe something

300
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,570
is happening they're called you out of
the blue

301
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,700
which sometimes happens am you should
prepare for it to you

302
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,970
again make sure you know the journalists
working for a lost their audience

303
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,270
you know i'd AP reporter general poorer
the writing for you know

304
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:02,530
Wired magazine or the writing for
newsweek or are they waiting for the

305
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,050
local

306
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,850
xem down the shop so the writing for you
Springfield community shopper

307
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,400
find out because that's going to that
showed affect how you deliver

308
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,180
your particular message take time take
your thoughts before an interview when i

309
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,000
call someone up

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm unless it's like a press flack or so
is really experience or someone I know

311
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
I've dealt with before

312
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,760
I always really surprised when a just
while on straight into the interview

313
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,610
because I never

314
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,260
do that and most I think that nobody
else that I know does that I call so we

315
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,890
have to make an appointment for an
interview

316
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,410
because I like it when it had a little
bit I'm think about a subject

317
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,459
and they prepare questions however some
people just while Argentine into

318
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,940
don't do that because sometimes it there
if especially if they if they have it

319
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,030
specific idea what they want to extract
from you

320
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,280
I did a much more sometimes you come
into a story you say well I wanna get

321
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,310
this kind a quote from this person I get
back on both numbers

322
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,750
and if they're not really engage with
the subject maybe they've got the wrong

323
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,410
ideas

324
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,630
and maybe they want to extract from you
because that's damaging

325
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,000
or quote that feeds into a stereotype
the donating

326
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,510
prepare perpetuate what you should do is
you should say well I'm really busy

327
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,109
right now

328
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,590
or a gotta do this one thing could we
talk tomorrow could we talk in 10

329
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,310
minutes time

330
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,470
ask the phone number to call you back in
10 minutes after I finish that

331
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,760
when it comes to thing wanna give you a
better time to talk tonight other phone

332
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,069
number

333
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,669
to go his column back a little later if
you if you really have to what you

334
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,490
should do then

335
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,060
in a little bit I'm you taken again pick
a time that's convenient to do you a

336
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,389
lesser like really there's some really
underlined

337
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,470
are you really experience that you can
likes this you sit down and you think

338
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,070
after spiel you know what is it you want
to get across the only gonna have time

339
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,580
really even it 30 minuti which you might
think it's a long time it's not

340
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,840
you really only going to get a few
points across do you have any

341
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,760
explanations that you need to make a
talking about something technically

342
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,190
talking at latest hack

343
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,970
our latest security exploited in you
know Internet Explorer

344
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,100
well how does that actually work in
programs that tend to think in very

345
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,420
abstract art com

346
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,080
terms you need to recap some very
concrete analogies

347
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,260
because and if you can do that that's a
real help to the germans because you're

348
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,030
really trying to do at this stage is
educate the journalists

349
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,610
you try to help them in their research
they can write and I story if you do

350
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,800
that not only does lead to a better
story

351
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,990
for you get known as somebody who's good
is a good X

352
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,520
use a good explainer somebody who you
can go back to later

353
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,650
I mean people always say you know Carl
Sagan France's use again of like

354
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,170
briefing

355
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:26,700
we finished our me communion and fine
when used in the physics community

356
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,550
and cool their places because Joseph
bring them up asked their opinions on

357
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,580
things

358
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,470
normal yield the winer would you call
Carl Sagan to talk about you know

359
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:38,960
just any signs topic they would bring
him up and they would ask mister

360
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,900
another side to get annoyed you know
Carl Sagan is not universal expert

361
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,100
know why to see why do I every time I
read a size paper did is dis

362
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,310
Carl Sagan opinion matter well the
reason Carl Sagan got to that point was

363
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,649
caused because Carl Sagan really thought
you had to explain things

364
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,180
and so is journalists were faced with a
difficult topic to understand

365
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,850
they knew they could bring up Carl and
Carol would give them and I still sound

366
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,920
bite that they could then use to explain

367
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,210
the topic if you can get that level what
you need where you can really explain

368
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,520
something it's really that teaching
something

369
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,240
to somebody who is not necessarily
expert in your field you can you really

370
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,730
matters

371
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,110
to do something am you know I P reporter
i cover computers in space

372
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,140
I like to think I know a reasonable
amount of topics be still would never in

373
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,780
a million years

374
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,520
ask me you know to write a compiler I'm
so ugly need help

375
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,840
understanding certain things even though
I know what a compiler does even though

376
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,480
you know

377
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm not write a script every now and
then to this day

378
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,290
and still tony La to help understanding
of these very technical details

379
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,820
so what you need to do is we think how
am I going to explain this is some

380
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,750
is regionally the Ripper he's not really
into the internals

381
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,920
you also should set up establish orkut
conditions free to

382
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,340
do you have any time constraints as a
journalist have any time constraints is

383
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,639
renting you're not going to talk about

384
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,760
and don't be weird with your conditions
though don't do don't 282 said don't do

385
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,440
yes Tom yes tom is famous for saying if
you want to do with them you gotta use

386
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,410
you know the new the Knicks on this
kinda stuff like this

387
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,360
and you get a certain men into I went
out that but you know any getting an

388
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,430
adept any

389
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,660
you know he does he starts putting in
these conditions the reaction to that

390
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,490
while there are three types adjourns

391
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,410
those who understand the whole canoe the
next thing and you agree with him

392
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,300
and so they're going to do anyway those
who understand and disagree with them

393
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,070
which case no matter I can he's going to
convince them to said they should call

394
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,419
it

395
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,630
inlex and those who don't know what the
hell is going on I think this is weird

396
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,160
and don't want to get into because they
don't want a a very wary because now

397
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,490
they bring us right about stuff they
don't fully understand

398
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,400
so you notice he doesn't get a huge
amount oppressed and that's why because

399
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,630
he tends to set up

400
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:40,910
some conditions now I could be wrong but
that's that's impressed their people

401
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,180
have given so don't just get don't do
weird sure if conditions like you're on

402
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,050
a talk with stuff for

403
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,470
you know you can't use the word occur in
a bad way and so on

404
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,470
you really just got it by yourself get
across the idea that you're trying to do

405
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,480
during into assume you're being recorded
am

406
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,540
yield state law varies from place to
place and in New York State for example

407
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,610
it's isley perfectly good record if one
person knows

408
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:09,640
that the recording is B is being done am
i wanna cry the conversation yourself

409
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,700
generator shacking by six dollar
induction

410
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,000
telephone pick up and you can take you
taped the conversation if you do not

411
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,570
tell journalists you doing up

412
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,179
and you have just helps to keep
everybody honest also even though I just

413
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,570
you know

414
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,830
told you how little love what you're
actually Cesar appear in print s you

415
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,100
everything you say is going to stay in
print

416
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,320
a.m. so what you wanna do is you don't
want to you know

417
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,210
say something that you would regret
seeing in print and again this is what

418
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,580
the spill is about because when you when
you think

419
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,780
for the interview you think what don't I
want to say i three

420
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,850
things are really want to avoid saying

421
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,620
and other don't still talks were noisy
you know sometimes I kept these calls in

422
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,600
people's oh no problem I'll call you
from the phone a great what do the

423
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,260
interview was I'm going to the airport

424
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,430
and I can hear maybe one word in 10
because you know he's driving down you

425
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,700
know

426
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,740
by 95 and car horns are blaring and
stuff like that

427
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,020
or their car or the carbonyl the
conference Florence always increases

428
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,030
don't use speakerphone sometimes I do
that and it's cuz the kind you'd get it

429
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,170
is weird creepy feeling if you're on the
phone and then they're on speakerphone

430
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,770
first of next hard to understand the
person and they also tend to

431
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,570
at do this conferring on interview it's
really irritating the top seven you guys

432
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,899
and you say you can you all see says
part it is safe

433
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,660
and they go well I think Trish

434
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,690
yes it's perfectly safe you know you
really not establishing a huge amount of

435
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,320
credibility there

436
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,060
at don't stray too far power from the
subject at hand which means that where

437
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,950
you really should do you should let the
journalists guy the conversation

438
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,430
but don't you know start well that
reminds me of a strange story one day

439
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,480
when me in CAM cruncher

440
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,510
you know try and stay try and stay on
topic also don't let the journalists

441
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,950
lead you whale

442
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,870
because sometimes maybe you know the
journalists ring up talk that one thing

443
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,810
but they really got nothing to talk in
the back

444
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,850
back their mind to let them know to a
bait-and-switch

445
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:59,260
you know if they go to craze and this is
where also if you've asked for am

446
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,000
if you ask for a little time to think
about something you should ask as well

447
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,730
at that point one you wanna talk about

453
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,430
easy way there that doesn't lead to any
nasty you know comments in print you can

454
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,740
say

455
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,520

456

I'm just key to express at Suffolk don't
get verbally aggressive top insulting to

457
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:32,810
anybody

458
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,139
any body including Microsoft you know
don't kill come in and say well those

459
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,380
Microsoft sir

460
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,470
there Bill Gates is the devil and he
sings bonnie is a complete jerk

461
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,490
well issued man Bill Gates personally
think in fact that statement don't say

462
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,330
it because

463
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,199
it makes you come across as someone
who's unreasonable who's got a personal

464
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,380
axe to grind

465
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,770
and it tends to obscure the point that
you want to make

466
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:00,210
am and I means to anybody you're really
keep it cool it's okay to get excited is

467
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,700
a really great thing and so on

468
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,130
but shall you want to keep your cool to
come across as a reasonable

469
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,450
rational human being squaring shouting

470
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,910
getting head up does not accomplish that
again this goes back to his loss a

471
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,040
jargon

472
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,320
you know try and break things down into
explainable terms

473
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,720
you know and you know one man's you know
and and really you know

474
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,160
do not use actions if you can possibly
avoided XLS a really really

475
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,610
obvious ones that you would have seen
you know the with the scene CNN

476
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,290
or the new york times use without
explanation really keep the jargon

477
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,860
don't miss don't get into an argument a
journalist because on the enough the

478
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,060
journalist has the last word

479
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,190
their writing the article even if you
crush them with your

480
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,700
compelling logic during interview they
can still go on right whatever kind of

481
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,480
story

482
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,980
they want journalists is not always
going to agree with you 100 percent of

483
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,630
the time

484
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,690
that's where it is sometimes a
journalist does agree with you but

485
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,200
they're still going to be asking
contrarian questions

486
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,970
because they've interviewed five other
people and there's a certain point to

487
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,030
view that they need to put across to you

488
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,060
so don't bother you get your brow
beating just because you know the

489
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,490
journalist doesn't seem to have become a
convert your particular

490
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,940
cars it's okay to give a little bit
background-color:

491
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,400
you know you can often times the air the
journalists I ask you will have did you

492
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,360
feel when you

493
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,490
discovered such-and-such you give a
little bit of been given all that occur

494
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,460
speak slowly and clearly again tailor
your answers think about not just a

495
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,060
journalist love compensate

496
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,399
but think about their audience think
about what their audience

497
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,500
is interested in hearing about that the
journal sky the conversation so again

498
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,290
don't go off on

499
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,629
long rounds put passengers can ask
questions

500
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,820
or can follow up on questions keep notes
if you not tape recording the engine

501
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,980
interview and even if you are you might
want to just keep a little

502
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,750
record what was said this important
because later on

503
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,700
it's something awful happens and and one
of my colleagues violates the tenants

504
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,120
out profession write something wrong

505
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,340
you are going to have to have some way
to backup you know

506
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,880
that you're saying that there are again
explain things in concrete terms

507
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,920
be open for follow-up sales you be
willing to say to them well you know

508
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,100
if you have any other questions about
this or you know related topics for free

509
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,110
to give me a call back

510
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,520
suggests other names that people that
they can talk to that's really

511
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,020
a really really good way again getting a
journalist to see your will be you can

512
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,150
say well this is great

513
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,020
but you know who else you should really
talk to is you know manuel said he's got

514
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,290
to step down cold

515
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,580
we've damn thing is you really at 10
yourself as a source because you become

516
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,470
you've just told you this really help
the journalists is gonna think good

517
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,780
thoughts

518
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,740
about you Ashley interview some
journalists as he merely signs

519
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,910
journalists

520
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,070
have a policy its first few most
journalists don't i mean i i

521
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,139
get laughed at some times by my
colleagues insert that straight Press

522
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,940
and you know when I say I by Cape Coast
people to check

523
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,350
and budget law science journals will do
that if you do have that opportunity

524
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,650
turn quickly

525
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,950
you can usually you're just being asked
you did you actually say this

526
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,490
it's possible the time to negotiate you
know a word here and there but it's not

527
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,270
an opportunity to rewrite history

528
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:02,700
and as a chance at the germans however
you said originally on tape

529
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,910
so the religious doing at as a courtesy
am townhouse the report you know don't

530
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,890
keep coming back

531
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,560
and calling up and saying when is at
peace appearing when is a piece

532
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,379
appearing

533
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,220
you promised we'd am I getting the cover
you know when is a piece appearing and

534
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,170
it I've had this happen to me and I have
been so when Lee that I've been tempted

535
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:19,650
just

536
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,679
kill a story just to get back up you
know just to say no that's right angle

537
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,770
trudeau

538
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,210
you know have happened a lot but I've
been sorely tempted

539
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,290
am oftentimes a reporter does not have
control

540
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,870
even if I go out right piece the
interview people you can get spiked

541
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,400
often for reasons outside my control
maybe a better story came up and took my

542
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,360
spot

543
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,490
you know maybe you know somebody else on
the higher editorial chain

544
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,450
didn't particularly like that peace and
if you give the reporter very hard time

545
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,400
all the time about it

546
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,830
well you know for softer public going
bonkers our story got spite

547
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,919
and I don't particularly want to know
reveal that they're not your master

548
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,450
their

549
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,860
take your universe to you and another
think good thoughts about you

550
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,160
and the whole point of all this is is to
accept that

551
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,010
you don't just wanna really do a
journalist once you want it like getting

552
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,600
to relate

553
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,850
cultivate a relationship with a
journalist to

554
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,130
be willing to accept that peace may not
run your way happens

555
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,290
I mean I've written it's very very very
very hard to read

556
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,460
right piece to opposing points of view
am

557
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,770
that both people like I think it's only
happened to me really

558
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,150
once am I wrote a story about at 70
using the Sun

559
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,350
his story Yahoo is the Nissan

560
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,470
owns the Nissan dot-com domain name and
all the enough Nissan Motor Car

561
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,720
not very happy about this especially
when

562
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,640
leuzzi start putting Caroline
advertisements on its homepage

563
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,950
and in this whole legal thing came came
back and forth in a

564
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,620
I actually met is your day HTK to
wheedle story basins

565
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,230
that was the only time we're both losing
me sad and Nissan Motor Corporation rang

566
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:51,990
me up to say

567
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,600
that was nice piece and really show
their point to be with the right one

568
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,720
that suddenly wants and tazreen like it
happened the point about it is is that

569
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,070
you need to go in

570
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:04,340
and look did you get your point across
what's your point of view for any

571
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,470
represent

572
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,960
if the laws that's great at if it wasn't

573
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,060
then you might want to consider about
writing a letter to the editor polite

574
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,620
letter

575
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,190
has a mind to be anonymous honest
mistake might not have been

576
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,490
but might have been a mistake AP police
that benefit at the desk

577
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,910
also the less aggressive you are in a
less insulting you are a letter

578
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,090
less defensive a.m. the last offensive

579
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,300
the the person is going to be about and
you know

580
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,670
well-handled complete can actually you
know oftentimes

581
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:37,500
if people get a complaint you get your
letter inform you can offer your letter

582
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,340
in a letter to the editor sometimes get
a correction and sometimes you can

583
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,760
continue at I love with him that it
helps get your point across you more so

584
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,670
than perhaps there is an article did

585
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,730
and so complain plenty to complain if
you've been screwed

586
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,600
but do not apply to matter again back it
up with some hard evidence

587
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,770
if you possibly can give checked in all
this

588
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:59,879
is that you want to become what's known
in the trade as a wise man

589
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,110
wise woman am which is somebody

590
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,860
I've few these people who I can call
about a particular subject is again I'm

591
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,370
an expert in everything

592
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:12,290
but I can call upon I can say any you
know what did you think about so-and-so

593
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,290
or there is this particular

594
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,428

that hacker you know %um

595
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:20,750
subjects which maybe is up 100 percent
under special but I know that the best

596
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,600
person

597
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,120
to give a good guess is the people I can
bring up and i cant talk to

598
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,800
cheetah fat usually it's on the record
am

599
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,730
and they will give me either their point
of view other committees for stories

600
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,270
maybe sometimes at the back to the front
on-the-record quotes

601
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,570
if you become one of those go to sources
if you become somebody that that your

602
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,260
list

603
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,490
you know is happy to take your calls
because you know they know you're going

604
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,900
to Houston every time

605
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,950
you can then get point you can bring
them up and you can go hey Steve you

606
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:47,919
heard about this going to be this thing

607
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,380
I think it's important that's great that
rules will take your calls because they

608
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,880
rely on you

609
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,090
it's much easier to get a story I'll
that way and you also have to endure

610
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:01,010
costly educating that rules helping to
shape their worldview

611
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,929
and so even though you might not get
quote every time or the names you get

612
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,230
suggest every time

613
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,050
your worldview is going to filter into
that room misperception

614
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,830
and that's a really nice place to be and
it's very easy to start their

615
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,800
relationship

616
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,850
again in the interview try and be
helpful to the journals

617
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,050
you know yes it is a certain amount of
their ask you questions are not your

618
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,740
friend have their own agenda

619
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,310
if you can be helpful an upfront and
honest explanatory

620
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:28,720
and then you know a useful resource

621
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,880
that your little come back to you again
again and again

622
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,820
because you know it's hard to find
people a good to explain things

623
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,889
technically

624
00:31:35,889 --> 00:31:39,090
and you know were non-experts me all the
help we can get

625
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,850
so that's really the goal is is trying
to be is try to become rather

626
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:46,710
the co 2 to go to sources as a final
note I forget to mention about

627
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,940
on-the-record an off-the-record can
assume everything is on the record

628
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,030
you can sometimes you can go to a
journalist again it

629
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,490
generally the more style mission
organization that work for the more

630
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,070
likely they are we going to honor rules
about off-the-record

631
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,740
on the record but as I like you know
journals and Hippocratic Oath

632
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,389
you know where to get thrown out the
profession if they if they if they if

633
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,950
they break what's on the record a lot of
the record

634
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:10,480
you can say to someone you can say this
interviews for background only

635
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,080
you can say that and that you generally
most people are that

636
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,250
gets a bit tricky if you for trying to
go on and off the record during an

637
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,399
interview

638
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,290
as people sometimes cloth record that I
will explain when they're going back on

639
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:21,649
their

640
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,990
you should say wanna go off the record
you say well i to go off the record here

641
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,830
now

642
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,860
say a piece and then say while gonna go
back on the record

643
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,870
most people will Alana that but again
some organizations want you have to make

644
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,220
a judgment based on

645
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,570
the research you did in a few minutes
while you're waiting you know to get my

646
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,530
car back

647
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:43,399
to make the kind the judge what kind in
organizational who is who is the roads

648
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:48,529
okay questions

649
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:51,669
okay well in my life again this is a
shipwright the point that I don't

650
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,700
I don't always talk about who might go
to sources are because sometimes I

651
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,269
talked about about sense to france II

652
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:01,169
my other Peters space so they're couple
people in nasa for instance who I can

653
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:01,720
call up

654
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,529
and I can say and they and they know
their locker court everything is saying

655
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:06,980
I can say what do you think about

656
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,360
you know how is how is how is your the
Naz reorganization effect you

657
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,429
there a couple people like that there
are a few

658
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:18,389
their offer them in their duty of the
people I met a conference is a so

659
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:20,240
someone can be very something can be

660
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,100
you know summer has a company's their
their Weatherston a guy

661
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,210
you know who I can call up I know that
this chemical instantly and so on enough

662
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,460
view

663
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,220
if you and you can probably figure out
who this is if you do very close now

664
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,570
says

665
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,580
might space later articles but I know is
going to make a quote I know it's gonna

666
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,590
be upfront and honest there's a guy sees

667
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:41,389
he's a top level guy there are the guys
who are you know I'd generally like

668
00:33:41,389 --> 00:33:45,259
people who are you really want a
journalist loves people who are who have

669
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:48,419
their hands on we hate it when we call
up in your

670
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,710
talk to a PR person ago yes as great a
Coe the vice president marketing

671
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,460
that's a terrible person talk to wanna
talk twenty engineers I wanna talk to

672
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,059
you now we're talkin as I wanna talk to
the person low down the chain

673
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:03,570
as possible usually because I can get
all the other stuff to their vice

674
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,049
president from their press releases from
the website so on

675
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:09,199
I do like hands on stuff because that
gives me

676
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,629
unique points-of-view unique Sep which
is going to make my story stand out from

677
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:16,529
the hundred or so other stories are just
written from Presley's

678
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:23,530
so I do I like I like people mister the
other questions

679
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:34,600
I would say she's oversubscribed II in
no doubt I'll make phone calls I

680
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,630
should've action action actually said
that

681
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,440
don't don't cold call people unless
something is really dramatic and

682
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,990
happening or you have already have a
relationship managers

683
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,220
once you've talked to a journalist
you've been a source than once

684
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:52,210
then it's okay to call call because they
day they know you not reaction up

685
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,030
Technical College case but I do like a
lot of your people I got a lot of people

686
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,860
call me up

687
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,640
and it's usually a bad moment could use
him in the middle of doing something

688
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,129
else

689
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,280
I call upon a guy like change middle
tiers and work out what the Spurs going

690
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,580
on it generally does not

691
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,890
you know I use don't have you know Jerry
does not rise level and usually going to

692
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,609
act because

693
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,820
Sam busy I but things to do the best way
as they say

694
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,090
really the best way I am surprised
people he is a more often is to

695
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:21,720
right a letter ol fashion later because
the terms a signal to noise ratio

696
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,780
an actual letter with a Stampin 100

697
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,130
respect that must go straight to the top
of the pop and

698
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,730
you know 2000 miles murder she's sign
yourself up for a lot of weird stuff

699
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,100
paper oh my god well you know

700
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,810
I would say you know yeah that's bad I'm
not mad at that point either

701
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,390
them but I do get a lot of I did a lot
of press releases may get a very cursory

702
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,690
return get checked sir

703
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,470
answer sec that question was use his
time in a particular individual is to

704
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,540
reported got to to 3000 emails

705
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,740
are it sorry paper press releases a week

706
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,360
week which is %um it is just too much
your saturated

707
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,400
sorry

708
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,100
them

709
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,650
him

710
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,380
and the question was about is a process
different if a company is trying to get

711
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,800
your

712
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,610
get the attention I was at the process
is no different and I get a lot a

713
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,870
company press releases

714
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,250
every press releases very similar
company

715
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,420
XYZ that has a dramatic new product
service which will revolutionize

716
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,090
XYZ dead for more details are interviews
contact

717
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,560
pure person here and it's really tough

718
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,930
you know sometimes and I have to say
sometimes I have gotten good stories at

719
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,740
a press releases

720
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,430
and not a huge amount the time I would
say again if your company

721
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,940
find out the specific person in the area
that you're trying to cover

722
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,430
if you're running that offer find out
who on that particular paper or news

723
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,490
organization or CNN or Alice find out
who is the specific individual tends to

724
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,840
do that you can do that now

725
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,140
thankfully with what you love this
search on their archive and then

726
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,290
right large them your blog you know dear
Joe I saw your story on block

727
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:14,580
I think you might also be interested
black and then tell them why because

728
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,120
this is significant significant advance
because where the first person to use

729
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,130
you know as a specific new technology
which is gonna become hot new thing:

730
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,820
yes and I'll and then I would attach the
press release then its latest press

731
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,170
release

732
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,290
are useful in that they they usually
have a lot good contact information to

733
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:34,980
the goodness

734
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,760
and of it as you to specific like very
mechanical things a person needs to know

735
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,220
about

736
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,290
running a story which is what is the
full

737
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,430
name up up the organization or person
what is their address add a limited

738
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,680
company or the appeal see

739
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,270
all I kinda view all I kind of like you
know just it'll be its boiler plate but

740
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,530
its action yesterday player play from a
circles

741
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:01,530
user

742
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:23,259
share and he's asking about what happens
when you know when you qualify as

743
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,850
hypothetically if I was going to hack
the White House

744
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,290
I would you know go through pork 25
orders an end you all that get stopped

745
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,020
at becomes if I was hiking the White
House I got important fight again the

746
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,850
question comes back to when I was
talking earlier about assuming

747
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,450
everything you say can be seen print

748
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,480
also assume the quotation marks can be
served moved

749
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,550
back and forth and anchor you

750
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,010
most girls will not most senior most
places do manage to maintain

751
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,050
enough stuff not too you know makeup
what he said

752
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:55,260
but they will you know choose the window
again so you need to come back and think

753
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:55,720
about

754
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,100
this goes back to what I don't want to
say you my ass in that situation

755
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,750
want to say I don't talk about
hypotheticals alright really don't

756
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,060
are you know well that's something I
really wouldn't be able to comment on

757
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,549
because

758
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,640
I know how to hack the White House here
you know you really

759
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,529
that's something we ought to be careful
now again you should consider the person

760
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,460
you're talking to use the Save got burnt

761
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,480
well you might have a journalist who
have you have you no

762
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,460
or whose work you for reading you like
you might think well at somebody I can

763
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,150
I can trust it does become down to a
trust issue as much as journalists are

764
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,470
not your friends near the enemy in are
discussing there is trust

765
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,760
the journalists usually is trust me
you're telling them the truth

766
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,750
and usually they try to check they're
not always able to but there is

767
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,500
a journalist kinda trust me you tell you
know you know completely answers or bar

768
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,820
munchausen universe

769
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:47,260
and you're trusting their gonna report
what they say actively but

770
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,490
you have to be thats its not abt that
you do have to measure if you're not

771
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,230
happy

772
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:54,960
with the journalists are you think
they've done you'll be sketchy step in

773
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,830
the past and you should know this before
you go into into should look at their

774
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,569
website you should look at their
publication

775
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:04,300
then you can say I don't talk about
hypotheticals or if you do catch a quote

776
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,290
in such a way that it couldn't possibly
be

777
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:09,660
be distorted against evidence

778
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:16,660
user

779
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:35,690
in

780
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,970
yeah actually an actually that's you
know that's what was gonna happen

781
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,370
and if you are speaking if they contact
you to the company you're speaking on

782
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,700
company time in a company phone number
and blah blah blah

783
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,410
if you want to be treated as a private
individual they say to the contact you

784
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:49,960
at work

785
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,660
you could say well I'm at work item that
this is a part of my work

786
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,839
we should discuss this at all and again
when you're talking about members is

787
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,520
setting the terms in the car

788
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,820
the conditions at the interview it's
reasonable that point to say

789
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,990
I'm speaking as a private individual
nothing I say

790
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,520
should be attributed as part of my
employer's and then you have a base them

791
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,259
for going back if they do say you're
speaking for you know

792
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,090
XYZ Corporation you can say no I
specifically establish that the

793
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,790
journalist that was not the case

794
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,150
it is very difficult if i if i call
somebody yo

795
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,470
in their role as you know a project
manager at a particular company I'm

796
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,770
talking the company time

797
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,990
to really distinguish that you might
wanna say you know

798
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,080
this is a personal matter I wanna call
you after work

799
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,259
you are calling from my home phone and
that makes it very hard for the

800
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,230
journalists to

801
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,740
if they are you in if you're complaining
outwards to elicit well I thought they

802
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:42,830
were speaking for the company

803
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,190
when you can go well I told you it was a
speaker the company in a major car me on

804
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:46,840
my home phone

805
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:53,840
in

806
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,910
min

807
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:02,910
right

808
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,500
well and then in that case honestly even
you should really think twice about

809
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,630
talking to journalist

810
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,750
is going you very very difficult for
them to distinguish

811
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:14,040
a new profession in your employer's
gonna think the same thing to be able to

812
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,730
distinguish

813
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,350
your role at you because you can contact
us somebody in the company

814
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,080
as a person particular role I copy
that's why the talking to in the first

815
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,560
place

816
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,160
is gonna be almost impossible to
distinguish them for that between you

817
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,020
and Joe show any and in any case is

818
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,780
it's worthless the journalists if they
do that if I just consider you a private

819
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,610
individual I don't catch a few

820
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,920
in any way that you're also happen to be
a you know

821
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,240
a researcher at Symantec or whatever
happens to be

822
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,580
why my why are you being called in the
first place is going to be the top when

823
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,380
the reader comes

824
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:46,630
so in many case that actually might be a
situation whereby if you

825
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,840
you just should not talk two journals
that particular case

826
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,390
if you can't talk officially and your
position is such that the rules are

827
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:53,960
going to be

828
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,700
all invariably smeared that should be a
case for maybe you should either

829
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,540
talk you are you sure either talk not
talking at all

830
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:05,000
or insist re going to talk to my
background or off the record

831
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,060
and then they can use your information
in other ways but nah case that should

832
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,770
be a case we should be very wary that
going on the press because it's going to

833
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,070
be very difficult for anybody

834
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:16,580
including a journalist to be able to
tell your bills part as it got my

835
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:23,580
I'd this user

836
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,940
no I mean most the stuff is it so the
question was at you know I thought

837
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,230
channel are material to I did out to so
many my company that is going to a

838
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,109
central database

839
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:47,029
no mo submitted material that comes into
the country into the company whether

840
00:43:47,029 --> 00:43:47,309
it's

841
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:52,470
its paper or email you know is usually
addressed specifically to me

842
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:56,279
am somebody might see I will be routed
but it's not the jobless idiot or a

843
00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:58,130
assists and someone to make those kinda

844
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:03,180
I love filtering decisions that's done
by me doesn't get into into a database

845
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,279
my email and my email generally you know

846
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:10,720
my my filters take care a lot about and
you know sometimes so I might not even

847
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,180
see it

848
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,960
you can see here's a bunch of stop so to
get entered into a database and of the

849
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,180
times that we quickly

850
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,249
I with us I'll I'll make a very rapid
decision

851
00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:24,339
reading goes into the trash can or into
I had a physical or electronic furs

852
00:44:24,339 --> 00:44:28,640
trash can it's not recorded some presley
sources I will record

853
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,920
unified don't read them but these are
generally presley's i subscribe to

854
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,119
and that I later on think that I'm going
to need to mine for particular

855
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,239
information such as

856
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,900
either the nasa HQ press release feed
him I need to go back into that

857
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,670
but as a general rule I don't archive
all press release

858
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,480
time for the one more question area

859
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:54,480
you I think that it would hold one more

860
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:27,540
one again it's but it's it can it stay
no there you need to look to any

861
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,620
indicate damn I've been keeping all the
facts you gotta be careful he was he

862
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,660
just saying this fax in december's fax

863
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,310
to them okay with the night in that case
in that case

864
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:40,150
but but fund so the question was there
there was a scientist who is taking off

865
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,630
love attribution for something

866
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:45,410
and other scientists call them on and
send the organization with but but but

867
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,040
the fax

868
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,300
and all the organization to set up the
account for scientists to know

869
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,050
calling out for it said there's some
controversy over the attribution

870
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,230
unfortunately

871
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:56,740
when you if you're if I'm a final paper
are I'm doing my

872
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,030
up onto my my day and I get all this
information one person somebody else

873
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,100
calls me up and says

874
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,700
you know I'm often because again school
I'm not an expert in the field

875
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,830
I'm often are capable make that
determination I'm of non-public not

876
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:09,660
going to go out

877
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,859
and and call the first guy liar because

878
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,920
you know I'm not in a position i cant I
can't vouch for the process that

879
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,850
evidence if the third person comes in
and says

880
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,580
you know someone who I know again
discuss my source I called my sources

881
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,490
here what do you think that

882
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,520
Joe Bloggs actually do this year was the
other guy ago Isles

883
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,270
probably into got then I'm I'm probably
more willing to do it we we do we've had

884
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,000
situation attribution people get
upgraded and downgraded and suffered a

885
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,060
but in that situation right to people it
would be like he said she said

886
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,730
thing and I'll probably just go with you
know there's some controversy over the

887
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,420
attribution

888
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,040
effect new little bit more about I might
be more willing to go in arguments and

889
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,550
drop out something or some other

890
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,690
again I'm not gonna campaign for you I'm
not gonna start going out unlike

891
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:53,200
running a truth campaign about this
particular but this particular guy

892
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:53,660
because
