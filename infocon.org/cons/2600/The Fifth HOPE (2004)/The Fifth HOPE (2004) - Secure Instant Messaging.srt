1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,569
far and I guess anybody said in last
talk knows me as Mike Davis now so

2
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:05,290
secret's out

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,879
sorry I'm here to talk about secure
instant messaging and for some reason

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,290
it seems I have to explain why people
need to secure instant messaging so

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,539
I'm going to start with simple fact that
each and every one of you

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,859
used instant messenger during his con-
has had your in packets captured stored

7
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:28,300
and are on my laptop right now a

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,360
if anybody you know would like to see a
blog what I have on AOL MSN or Yahoo

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,550
a I can't bring it up on the screen if
you want I'm not gonna I'm not

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,140
the packets and I am gonna dump today
aren't going to be a all the packets and

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,430
many users censored

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,910
mostly so it's not enough to tell you
know phone numbers email addresses or

13
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,030
anything like that but

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,539
if you actually want to dump your
trafico be happy to dump it on screen

15
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,520
okay

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:05,520
through it fix them

17
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:10,030
so where are my talking about an hour if
anybody is at our apartment last night

18
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,890
the hacker halfway house you know why I
wrote about an hour

19
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,100
it's been

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,840
rhea I can make fun

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,840
yes sorry don't have power point HTML
and h1 tags are vital I've got at the

22
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:29,789
moment

23
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:33,450
the so yeah in the year two thousand I
wrote a

24
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,280
brought a small program called blames
blowfish April into messenger

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,829
it you said 2k bit development exchange

26
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:47,479
and a for 48-bit blowfish for this
metric Seifert a

27
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:53,479
this was mostly done for joke nobody the
time had a secure instant messenger and

28
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,569
it was kinda vasily frivolous thing to
do to

29
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,670
throw a lot of encryption at something
as silly as

30
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,569
a message you send us a hey I'm on my
way home a

31
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:07,149
but in the year two thousand apparently
couple other companies had started doing

32
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:08,209
things like a

33
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,980
secure instant messaging but the only
people who had actually done it

34
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,790
are it will script kiddies who actually
released program called Dynojet

35
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,130
that chat used secure static

36
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,500
exclusive worky which was actually set
the secret the program itself

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,680
work by cooking looking windows messages

38
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,840
in the AOL chat rooms in that crappy
crappy

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,760
lol dialogue program on you know a lot
of people nobody really used it

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,090
disappeared rather quickly

41
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,280
silk was an encrypted a dire si client

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,209
if you want count higher see as an
instant messenger which my body is

43
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,410
kinda pointed out is arguably considered
instant messaging but

44
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,609
whatever they still came out with it
about a month after blames released

45
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,829
blame is my particular programs

46
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:01,569
2048 bit th for for a bit more fish

47
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,419
went through all that I later on decided
that after the dot-com bust

48
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,440
probably you make a bahco this kinda
thing is nobody else had it

49
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,859
and a I released impasse which is

50
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:17,439
years in Tibet are safer for a bit
blowfish ran only under windows and

51
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,640
well sucked the later on we started
getting a lot more imitators you can

52
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,980
read list for yourself

53
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,549
more and more recent that the get the
crappier and crappier that they actually

54
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:29,090
get

55
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,150
lower and lower ceilings and if you see
on the last 2*i stop twisting

56
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,420
actually more instant messaging clients
there's actually

57
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,489
you know no mention of what I
prescription use whatsoever no key

58
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:42,280
lengths no

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,930
you know so just over secret encryption
trust us with keep everything secure for

60
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,189
you

61
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:50,640
i cant you said I'm

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,409
also at the time

63
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:57,790
I was releasing blame do well her sorry
impasse

64
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,780
a wellhead promised a lot over
supporters that

65
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,129
basically they were going to release a
Enterprise Edition 0

66
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,010
able into messenger the Enterprise
Edition was supposed to be the magical

67
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,010
on wonder gateway that everyone could
use keep all the instant messages secure

68
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,510
and only of course well would be able to
traffic

69
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,700
trustee well they never actually
released

70
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,909
encryption package with their enterprise
messaging the only released a gateway

71
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:28,919
they later on told people that it's
coming it's coming

72
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,950
was coming basically killing my business
entirely and they never actually

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,530
released

74
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,510
they later on as probably cut off in
about a screen

75
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,050
actually last few months sold the
company to a comic systems

76
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,719
comic system specialized in logging
instant message gateways

77
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:50,990
for yeah lighting is misty ways
basically they log every instant message

78
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,010
for quote SEC compliance

79
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:58,060
and I don't know if you can trust her
crib shoe company

80
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,539
specialize a

81
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,810
anyway going back a little bit too blame
I

82
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,639
had a little bit of a problem with blame
in that area well was trying to release

83
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,190
their

84
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,469
commercial version of the software and
they tried pushing

85
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:18,430
out of business so what we actually
ended up with was

86
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,789
my very first season the system simply
me build bigger

87
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:26,740
I'm working on them

88
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,940
ok troubles

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,919
yeah I don't know that you actually want
to read this thing

90
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,318
it's basically saying that to I can call
my software blame because they own

91
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,830
any word that ends in im

92
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,500
they also serve notices to project
organizers a

93
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,759
game which you probably use name team
and he-man

94
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,190
all the other derivatives but they went
after me particularly hard game got to

95
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,550
actually keep their name

96
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,060
well game her blame itself was like this
I can no longer keep my project on

97
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,259
SourceForge

98
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,289
the company that owned at the time VA
winik's said that

99
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:13,009
I'm welcome to get a lawyer but that
they're not good for my project rack up

100
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:17,330
K number encryption people actually
complained about this I found newsgroup

101
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,229
posting after newsgroup posting about

102
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:22,849
why people can encrypt in this is a
whether reasons why

103
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,719
they can suppress the

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,349
so I started producing impasse your

105
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,419
missions I area company came along and
said hey we notice you're making this

106
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,030
really cool instant messaging crypts in
software

107
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,460
to give you an idea what people think
securing the instant messages

108
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,610
this company and uncensored you know

109
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,639
no I don't care actually do this
literally a uncensored email from a

110
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,210
company who wanted to add spyware

111
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,470
to my instant messaging package I i
don't know if that seems like a

112
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,349
a conflict anyone else but yes

113
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:09,710
yet so so take a look that so what J
back at lion's pride enterprises

114
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,590
feel free to email these guys whenever
you want

115
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,710
email them as much as you want actual so
now moving on to know why I have to

116
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,099
actually explain it secures the
messaging is totally secure

117
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,150
multiple reasons actually first we'll is
that every single instant messaging

118
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,150
protocol

119
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,500
is done in the clear

120
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,050
is an open a bakery that these are
actually captures that I got during the

121
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,659
con

122
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,729
used my not privileges to

123
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:43,500
double your traffic is usually is your
eyes peer anyone else upstream good

124
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,849
even your roommates are probably doing
something like this so we take a look at

125
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:48,190
these love these are really good

126
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,030
the first to packet captures came during
the manual goldstein's

127
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,509
off the hook talk where he messes
mentioned that

128
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,409
these pepsi's cell phone coke cans
whatever was a

129
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,490
had a little cell phone and GPS
transceiver insider

130
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,659
transmitter/receiver whatever inside of
them and a

131
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,650
that military is basically going apeshit
over and this is somebody sitting on the

132
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,509
talk

133
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:14,909
I've censor their name with axes there
you can brute force that if you feel

134
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:15,960
like it

135
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,650
the basically saying that all you never
know what to bring them in secure area

136
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,830
so maybe that's a fair in the mountains
bottom

137
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,229
see other people appreciating the
wireless band with

138
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,900
oh yeah my favorite are the ones that
very bottom here that your conversation

139
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,549
is not secure in his neck

140
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,919
this network is not secure and they just
keep going on and on and on

141
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,968
I was even able to capture packets from
a in our good friend regular

142
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:46,329
who happens who written kismet

143
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:50,199
knows well about the problems things
like instant messaging

144
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,959
other things a I know I promise its
insertion into that somebody's phone

145
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,490
number I forgot the sensor

146
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,829
just ignore that pretend it's not there

147
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:02,959
there's a a packet at yeah I guess at a
road in our site

148
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,130
I'm

149
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,430
somebody sensor um down at the bottom it
was somebody else doing the same thing I

150
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,079
am downloading the 310

151
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:15,420
saying how cool the program it's a

152
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,860
segments that's cool great so i dont
your packets

153
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,689
that's one of the ways in which is the
mystery is vulnerable its it's pretty

154
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:24,560
simple one I can read your package we've
known this for ages but

155
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,040
companies kinda ignored they pretend it
doesn't exist it's not a problem

156
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,530
and a few companies that actually do
like sbcglobal try to reach out and get

157
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,730
instant messaging

158
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,870
they were duped by a well into waiting
and waiting and waiting and now still

159
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,220
currently have no security

160
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,660
domestic solution so up to 300,000
employees that they

161
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,309
had intended on securing that secures
the messages are completely going

162
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:48,339
you know over a clear in not being
filtered

163
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,350
a because they didn't load

164
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,339
is this file

165
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,880
some other things that actually noticed
while I was doing this

166
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,230
is that there's there's likely a format
string exploit in the air while

167
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,640
protocols themselves is pretty clear its
at the bonds really

168
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,850
actually that last one

169
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,990
%um protector summary alright well
whatever the

170
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,579
basically AOL gives a URL to the client

171
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:21,809
and uses that URL as a direct entry into

172
00:10:21,809 --> 00:10:26,380
print and at the very last the the very
first argument that they have as a

173
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,400
person as

174
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,020
you know for mister exploits percent
askin be

175
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,610
change into a whole bunch of percent
taxes percent use

176
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,819
and eventually percent and Zim
overriding the IPM

177
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,319
well you can figure out the rest the
other part of it is that the passwords

178
00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:46,089
are actually sent as md5 passwords

179
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:50,569
artists and 25 crips but reportedly most
people only use

180
00:10:50,569 --> 00:10:54,520
five to six digit password with her
pretty easily proved forced with

181
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,220
I think md5 crackers when the program's
energy sector makes up for in a sober

182
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,380
forces these you probably brute force a
five digit password in

183
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,339
you know few hours six to seven digit
password me take you a few more hours

184
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,030
maybe a day

185
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,760
you can get the idea and how many have
you actually use the same password on

186
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,540
your instant messenger that you use

187
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,589
to log into your box

188
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,939
I'm I can put anyone out I you also see
here that there's plugins for you

189
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:25,299
instances very last pack free here

190
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:28,410
I'm is also kind of dangerous because
it's doing the same thing that AOL is

191
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,939
doing using percent and I have it

192
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:34,969
in a different area because I I'm using
it to show off what I can tell types of

193
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,329
free running

194
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,339
but as per cent and is also pretty
easily exploitable so long as you can

195
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:43,990
edit the packet stream and we're
actually running for myself I could have

196
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,679
filtered packets in

197
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,679
changed as per cent ans into something a
bit more malicious

198
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:52,250
and the way I would have been able to do
that is because I also know the exact

199
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,150
version number using the exact version
of Windows are you using

200
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,540
Kors some reason he was curious and

201
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,780
I also know the architecture system
exact

202
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,890
build number for Windows and I know
there's also parted version windows

203
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,730
because it's that

204
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,689
2600 build

205
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:16,380
or elsewhere

206
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,970
means well I guess that's kinda the

207
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,310
Vienna my little cuter I've shown you
that I've split everyone at the con kind

208
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,899
of thing

209
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,899
if anyone actually wants me to dump
their traffic and be happy to do that

210
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:35,899
anybody wants to volunteer for it again

211
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,270
on AOL idea

212
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,420
you actually group

213
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,020
I can't type Mr B 00

214
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:01,020
so awesome

215
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,880
now to slims

216
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,060
I actually done too little over 70 gigs
in traffic

217
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,630
not just heard certain i sorry said
seventy maghame traffic on not just a

218
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,240
well

219
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,160
I mostly have complete set up for a
while data from the moment I never came

220
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,050
out to

221
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,700
about an hour before my talk I also
started capturing at a later point

222
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,100
Yahoo and MSN traffic I didn't get to go
through as packets

223
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,630
but probably go through them later we
all your conversations

224
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:49,630
I'm you're comfortable I actually did
not find a single person using deemed me

225
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,290
or blame or any other securities a
messaging package most people were using

226
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,930
the Mac OS X client by chance for

227
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,110
one or the other open source clients
actually found very few open source

228
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,770
lines on the network so much to be
running either imaxr

229
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,110
Windows 2000 she's rip this point in
your I'm

230
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,900
I didn't see a lot of my secure but I
see two is

231
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,580
is very hard to distinguish from here
well since

232
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,900
a well purchased ice issue in mood ICQ
over to the Oscar protocol

233
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,690
which is supposed to be in open protocol
because it's actually

234
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,860
named open protocol but it is nine times

235
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,930
you know them their client over to it
the only difference between I see

236
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,720
ICQ uses

237
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,690
RTS instead of HTML and

238
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,230
that's that's kinda did they also don't
allow

239
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,680
binary content packets a well for some
reason does

240
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,400
I think it's probably for those buddy
icons

241
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,430
nope come true binary contents
communalism

242
00:14:53,430 --> 00:15:00,430
sleepy capital

243
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:18,070
the mister body capitalized

244
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,710
well what you see here also are

245
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,150
people's buddy list actually refreshing
I really

246
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,030
you just feel free to add new home
please cast your buddy list 'em

247
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:40,360
home but if you want to have an idea of
the amount of data that actually

248
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,420
captured hearings

249
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,480
90

250
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,860
this is just the the AOL packets so the
able packed themselves

251
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,860
so a lot of data including most secure
passwords

252
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,329
is also a lot of people checking her pop
three male fuck is wrong with you people

253
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,870
its it makes you feel any better though
the only data that's a actually kept

254
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,600
is a the its domestic data you're not
happy with that

255
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,520
let me know actually tweeted early
really want to do this during the con

256
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,370
because it's a

257
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,130
has far more impact we can show people
their actual packets

258
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:27,130
up on the screen issue

259
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,529
I I don't know if anybody was a VPN out
I just stuck to

260
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,079
very basic filters 0 watching work by 15
5090

261
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,470
50/50 in by 1634 MSN Messenger

262
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,170
I'm as investors actually the heart is
protocol to you need if you're going to

263
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:41,420
be

264
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,550
silly packet sniffing packets you take a
look at this packet rate actually

265
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,129
hopefully carry this guy's name butter

266
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:52,699
the Packers are just a issue mail format
packets and you can read the age to be

267
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,879
around the fact there's nothing really
competent

268
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,959
MSN Messenger pro callers is for you
easier to read because it uses it

269
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,130
HTML header file and basically says our
message is going to be a 163 by Swan

270
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,880
and here's a plain text message with no
other formatting added to it open

271
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,140
HTML scapes I guess that Sky News

272
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:19,140
the this person only if you want to add
something my god oh my god he really

273
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,409
hit you up hopefully if anybody else has
any questions like come up because

274
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:29,840
I work much better last MSN Messenger
password encryption

275
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,408
to the impossible I'm actually the you
something very similar they're they're

276
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:38,210
both using something you can do either
md5 directly or using some

277
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:45,210
simple variation mb5 like switching the
byte order something

278
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,280
him as an intellectual gone through a
whole lotta love changing their actually

279
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,690
working to try to have

280
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,730
some sort of encryption infrastructure
built into their

281
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,690
their messaging but its so far not an
end and

282
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,230
ripken solution AOL has always seemed to
work themselves into the protocol I miss

283
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,740
and also to work themselves in the
protocol every time

284
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,980
a well however seems to be the only
company that

285
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,120
seems to try to force people not to mess
with the package tree maybe includes

286
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,760
things like

287
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,740
their your own sequence headers sequence
numbers for individual conversations

288
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,070
I can't really speculate as to why but
I'm currently I am

289
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,310
I speculate that it's easy to put
together conversations later when each

290
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:25,889
message

291
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,630
sequence number time date stamp in
header anybody else have any questions

292
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:38,630
I was under the impression that one
point

293
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,710
a well as using the X or

294
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,930
corruption for the earlier on in your
world possibly I

295
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,460
maybe the talk particle could be wrong
there there's two protocols taylor's the

296
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,460
talk protocol and then there's the Oscar
protocol

297
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,210
talk itself is very minimalist protocol
is

298
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,790
you know written for Java client
initially him they

299
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,950
they've upgraded downgraded over the
years to this

300
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,120
binary monster that is you know

301
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,880
packets hidden within packets within
packets entry-level structures and

302
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:15,360
sequence numbers and all kinds of dead
space in packets that are reserved for

303
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,640
things there there are also other things
I have sons

304
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,090
Richard there are also other things a
world added to their packets to

305
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,220
free event other clients ROM connected
to their network

306
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,710
and basically trying to be really mean
about

307
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:36,710
who makes them response

308
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:44,119
up

309
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,629
aware

310
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,090
I it

311
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,230
to HTML so im

312
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:58,320
well when AOL initially tried locking
out its a the open-source clients

313
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,750
by adding things like a md5 and I
actually only five something sorry but

314
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,610
but hashing

315
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,650
the binaries in themselves this is a was
kinda DEM

316
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,049
guys are the game guys response if you
you look at the name in the structures

317
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:12,460
then

318
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,220
and the to fund is that it's ok to work
around a lil za changing the protocol

319
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,260
here piece of crap damn you

320
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,420
and go straight to her are straight to
hell a

321
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,610
a lot of this was worked around actually
storing the binaries on the AOL

322
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,760
our own the SourceForge game servers and
he will actually never looked like they

323
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,000
probably could have had a pull-down

324
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,169
this to violation their Terms of Service
they actually

325
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:39,179
store these binders in use in any other
way than was directed by

326
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,040
game actually allowed you to hit their
site Missy Giants

327
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,700
but still they're actually that will
give you the hash for any

328
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,710
over the sections on this or the binary
that

329
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,760
deals requesting so

330
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,919
one of the many ways they do it I'd also
shows

331
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,080
wannabes actual packets but they start
adding things like

332
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,960
very small packet that the are the same
guys the guys were actually

333
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,980
implemented Oscar for open source you
space

334
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:12,250
this little small packet nobody really
knew the contents of the package was

335
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,570
teal the type 5i believe and

336
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,059
it could be either three or four bytes 1
and they began implementing it as a

337
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:23,220
a 4-byte one packet and the open-source
clients mealy picked up in because they

338
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,910
don't truly understand particle they

339
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,309
they threw that images we don't
understand his does but in every packet

340
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:29,379
the server 1accepted

341
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,010
a will then begin switching all its
clients to use a 1-2-3 for that package

342
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:37,620
they were able to actually distinguish
older people using open source clients

343
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:37,919
in

344
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,040
began blocking on that they've since
start doing all this blocking

345
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,980
the little prince the reasons and
Williams

346
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,299
on what about reconstructing

347
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:53,830
video packets via MSN Messenger most the
time

348
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,760
MSN Messenger you know it's perfectly
possible nobody's actually written a

349
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,480
package yet maybe a lil

350
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,530
to actually take the raw data and
reconstruct them into a video stream

351
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,460
the most the time those packets are
connected client to client they don't

352
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,160
actually go through mail servers

353
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,540
the instant messages themselves to go
through mail servers in

354
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,540
that's why I find the biggest threat
because most the time something like it

355
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,320
wants to messenger can easily be used

356
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,010
and is actually used by some people to
circumvent firewall rules

357
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,020
I'm transporting files and not have

358
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,470
their offices I actually wrote a program
before called

359
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,300
Pyrex which would allow you to export
next turns using AOL Instant Messenger

360
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:39,300
so three

361
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:44,640
women

362
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,760
it won't encrypt it one of the ways

363
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,950
my my software impasse that I but
actually done like the or trying to

364
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,520
export there will be using socks for
socks5 proxy

365
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,990
so all the connections the client
attempted to make would go through that

366
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,590
proxy

367
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,000
and all the packets but they get
filtered it's a really trivial

368
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,630
amount of work to actually remove the
contents want to understand format the

369
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,130
packet

370
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,390
encrypt it put it back in a packet have
it undone on the other end

371
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,100
believe it or not a lot of people were
disappointed with the idea that you

372
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,270
actually have a have

373
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,340
acclaimed on both hands to encrypt the
conversation

374
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,959
they were perfectly okay with having
encrypt it to AOL not encrypt it

375
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,360
for the rest of the way there are some
other packets that I found during his

376
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,730
capture by the way that

377
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,580
had user names and passwords for
machines that were on the network I

378
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,460
don't know whether they came from
wireless or wired machine but there on

379
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:35,950
the wireless

380
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,250
somebody else probably has them just
just like

381
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,470
so

382
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,350
in light of the fact that seems like
most people don't use

383
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,570
open source clients and that well tends
to change the protocol

384
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,530
you know wildly would make more sense

385
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,730
you do something like make extremely
easy

386
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,220
for people using the center client to do
something like establish an SSH tunnel

387
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,370
or use a probably a better idea would be
to right

388
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,290
a proxy who that would do

389
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,730
I mean that has the problem that the
other end

390
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:22,290
you have to have a proxy to d crypt but
than the other challenges to get them to

391
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,870
actually change the server and port
number in their preferences

392
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,570
yet so I mean to do you have any the
song everything about for a while

393
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,689
you have any insights on that because
the way that I did before was actually a

394
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:33,780
dirty cheat

395
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,780
and only work for Windows because my son
to the time was that

396
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,210
on the Windows would make money opens
for System z

397
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,510
money I by the way it didn't make any
money

398
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,490
i believe i spent around 2500 marijuana

399
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,410
writing impasse and I made about three
months where the rent on a college

400
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,640
campus right to your room

401
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,910
with impasse so I'm as far as changing
the settings any the client's

402
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,810
we kinda hardcore we gave them a simple
checkbox click here to activate a loans

403
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,560
to messenger to use encryption

404
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,600
and/or didn't change a registry settings
all these crime story is kinda

405
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,910
information registry so remove it and
reinstall so happy settings there

406
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:19,900
indians right

407
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,400
well I guess that's kinda the indictment
if anybody else wants to come up after

408
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,240
you know they turn off the cameras and
things that make the turn of the

409
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,370
the video display be happy to show them
what I've actually captured

410
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,680
on otherwise

411
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,440
or away i do not go on AOL Instant
Messenger

412
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,210
no a lot of the people that actually a
lot of smart people who did go on AOL

413
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,170
Instant Messenger

414
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,240
accidentally prevented me from sleeping
there traffic by

415
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,740
using SSH distance to another machine
and then using the console client

416
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,120
while that may have prevented me from
sniffing at that didn't prevent

417
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,950
horizons you and before I go

418
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,510
sifted any years as any viewer at my
party last night you understand that

419
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,030
we have no money left we spent it on 61
leaders Barca

420
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,970
so if you don't want to donate money to
you know for vodka by t-shirt

421
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,990
downstairs RT a yeah this guys when I'm
here

422
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,780
send a famine a

423
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,990
yet sir shameless promotion to pay for
vodka this

424
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,590
report perhaps yeah we we we had all you
guys at our house you destroyed

425
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,760
everything sticky now

426
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,550
a I have lee also destroy the manuals
are in pretty badly

427
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,710
although it looks perfect not cool hop

428
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,390
are I'm done and far

429
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:52,390
I'm Brunswick announcement if you enjoy
the conference was certainly enjoyed

430
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,470
having you here

431
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,040
right now there's a lotta stuff that
needs to get cleaned up

432
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,990
now the closing ceremonies constraints I
certainly wouldn't want to work it out

433
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,230
but it happened have a volunteer spirit

434
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,260
hang around unstick some tape but this
some other stuff just find somebody to

435
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,690
the Red Badge a carry 0

436
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,580
thank you up
