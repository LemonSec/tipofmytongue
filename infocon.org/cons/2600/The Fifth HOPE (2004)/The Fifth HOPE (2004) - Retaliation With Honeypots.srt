right if you would please hold your
questions to the ending if you wouldn't

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,789
mind use the microphone we're not gonna
point the camera at the microphone so

7
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:29,400
don't worry

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,530
but when this goes out on the archive on
the web we don't want you know

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,739
thousands of hackers and thirty or forty
law enforcement officers training your

10
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:37,379
questions

11
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:41,140
so we can get those in everybody here
it'll be good

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,080
that's it

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,480
and without further ado we have fluent
doe

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,900
to speak about retaliation thank you

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,870
higher body an mamie zone do

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,199
I'm paying from France and they welcome
for the french chick you dont ozone

17
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,339
Department of Energy

18
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:06,479
US Department of Energy and I am a
member of the team

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,950
going stac Kim where you can find
everything on everest yes

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,560
it at all and also I am when I was a
member of the steering committee was a

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,640
hunnit projects

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,820
which is needed by in spinner so today
we're going to talk about

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,729
retaliation with a honey but that should
be honey

24
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,600
to

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,350
at first we begin with you they're easy
question why is it honey pots

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,909
in case people here we don't know is
very

27
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:40,950
and you anybody here who are either
deployed honey but

28
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,579
no okie cool then we'll be able to talk
about retaliation with honey but

29
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,880
and which is a core of the presentation
an

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,179
we've to mobile news which is adding
poisoning too honey

31
00:01:54,179 --> 00:01:57,810
and monitoring to trap I'm well we

32
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,929
we show you loads example blogs

33
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:04,640
on the honey but then we'll be able to
conclude

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,440
so first ways honey but as a No

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,829
she sunday and this is very only for
geeks for me see very only

36
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,370
and and was at

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,890
what can you see Notre can okay

38
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,209
okie those are fake

39
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,000
he'd come from fortitude we which was
called

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,440
was good name given to the cooperation
Monte measure eighties

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,370
tuned issues the germans about the dates
animals base

42
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,790
I was a lending for the day you know
disease

43
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,130
the birthday over sixteen-year September
0 credit

44
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:50,010
and so deception wats and we walk

45
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,959
okay an honey boats our security issues
that may be used to do that

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,070
attackers if we look at the definition

47
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,660
a proposed guidance prisoner as a leader
a hunnit projects

48
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,950
he said that's honey pots are computers
who sees

49
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,180
whose value lies in and authorize are
you should use of that resource

50
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,080
so job yields to be attacks

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,920
scan Rob a compromise so

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,320
how can you build your own towing to
play Wii U

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,920
agree source you can your to create
non-production networks

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,970
and devices systems

55
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,520
used two dudes attackers for example you
can build fake company

56
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,520
all fake association something that's
you have to log everything

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,190
system activity network activity because

58
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,170
for example you would like to grab
exploits was it the view

59
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,180
attacker and more and the roots keats

60
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,200
and stuff like that and it works re same

61
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,870
whatever cool thing we honey party
that's why do people

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,900
we attack you honey pots you wanna touch
your protection system

63
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,100
so butts this is very risky because you
have to protect

64
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,630
the specific infrastructure for example
what would happen if

65
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,280
the honey but is used to build homes for
example on

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,500
on pending at the ngo or something like
that

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,150
you know so you will be the source of
the attack so

68
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,299
is very difficult to deal with album
traffic

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,470
from your honey buns and then you just
have to wait and see and look at that

70
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,070
occurs

71
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,190
losing time integer so more about
honeypots

72
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,930
an youth if you think about deploying
honey butts

73
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,229
take your legal issues for example

74
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:44,969
in some countries by you might have
problem with entrapment

75
00:04:44,969 --> 00:04:48,090
trucking recording privacy for example

76
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,639
what if you are recording everything you
honey boats and thats

77
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,369
Black Cats decide to have distributions

78
00:04:57,369 --> 00:05:00,389
in your honey butts if you're recording
just discusion

79
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:03,659
heats legal or illegal so just eat

80
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:08,589
deep in love your country on for example
you have to check on

81
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:13,449
too honey adult home website for example
and also I talk about notes

82
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:16,860
just before way for an attack or use
your honey but to jump elsewhere

83
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,080
that's that's the main problem also we
have technical issues

84
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,349
like you have to how the internet works
and to avoid bones use

85
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,628
and you have to do you still problems

86
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,180
for now the Black Cat People on

87
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,279
just want to try to fingerprints yo
honey pots

88
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,308
they want to know you this is a honey
but for example

89
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:42,089
easy to VMware they will try to look at
dates as we try to

90
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:45,509
receives again accessoryname 0 to try to
look usery's

91
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,529
and traffic on the network system
activities and stuff like that

92
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:54,949
so that's that might be difficult and
also you need time to many doors a box

93
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:00,529
and a nice intrusions so some managers
say that honey butt sex because

94
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,870
didn't have time to look at the logs
over of their real

95
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,539
protection system way we did add
something else

96
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:13,248
I'm I don't know from fails if you go up
cyclical

97
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:17,639
porno you people say do you really want
to play with agree source

98
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,800
what E for example a black hat see
that's

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
this is a horny boats we his trademark
of some piano

100
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,369
I don't know domain are

101
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:30,680
if you want more information about honey
but just joined the audience

102
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,019
on honey adult on and okay

103
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,089
so who knows

104
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,169
honey every okay

105
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:45,019
honey bees pretty cool open source
projects which is needed by news promos

106
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:49,949
a member as a hunnit projects and
disease a unique diamond

107
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,779
that will help you creating sows in
solemn

108
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,569
on love fake computers and take services

109
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:00,730
on only one computer

110
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,420
and is very cool because it can schools

111
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,200
tools like and map and its probe and for
example you can peel

112
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,650
we've I dunno few on

113
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,860
few lines over configuration you can
build for example

114
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,030
if a cluster of PlayStation 2 that's
that's quite funny you can imagine

115
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,770
someone Anna from a foreign country
attacking you on

116
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,919
fake Louis turrentine dude there is a
PlayStation 2 cluster

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,210
that strange event everything is fake

118
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,650
so eaves attacker send an exploit we
grab exploit and that's that's quite

119
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,060
funny

120
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,260
so this is very easy also to simulates

121
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,159
Alberta I meet Rory routing topologies
and supply that's

122
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,290
and to show you for example

123
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,440
as you might see from from the network
when packets come

124
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,210
and i'm too honey D and

125
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,690
eat come true sleepy kept and ends there
is a view try p sac

126
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,910
and that he was back its and depending
on size and type of bike its

127
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,640
for example if his DC Pnut bien the
honey do you want to simulate

128
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,450
it fake servers to delude aggressor then

129
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,770
and honeydew relaunch an external
program

130
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,190
that will deal weeks ago aggressor and
stimulates

131
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,340
a ser vice then when packets will go

132
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,100
out I was a honey pots it will go
through something that his goals a

133
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,500
person 80 and Jain

134
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,500
to fool for example tools like and my
porridge probs again

135
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,510
so to come here honey dis is very easy
you just have to fork use

136
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,130
on creation will create imagine what
could be your own fate network and

137
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,770
systems

138
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,149
Angeles write a configuration for
example I would like

139
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,570
if a box with Linux on one under a night

140
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,630
to and 168 thats 1.2 into

141
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,450
we a fake email server in Fig sweet
surrender waiver

142
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,250
you decide to create for example created
some plates say

143
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,779
the person 80 will be Linux kernel and
we've dispersion

144
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,360
and I would like your freaky emailed
serve ice

145
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,870
on port 25 so just launch fakes and made
the appeal

146
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,279
a script for global I would like a fake
squee they would like a pic proxy

147
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:26,840
and waiver you just have to create
that's very you should try

148
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,050
so however the fake services

149
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:33,520
as again she's attacker for example
we'll try to learn

150
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,689
to play and talk with your honey pots
and say

151
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:40,760
for example hello side that come I
methinks Palmer and I want to

152
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,810
Sen 1000 and thousands but I'm okie

153
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,570
honey we say OK is a resume a spammer

154
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,960
am I'll sorry there is someone who want
to talk with my

155
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,510
fake send mail service he will

156
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,590
it will launch ASM fake and

157
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,050
external send me scripps and these fake

158
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,490
external script just have to deal we've
inputs and outputs

159
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,090
for example East I receive hello then I
we write something

160
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,320
if I receive the May from a year I
something and dizzy

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,190
you might see this is very easy to write
your own fake service

162
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,260
then it will launch for example dancer

163
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,490
send your Answer and honey the wheel on
finally

164
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,920
sends a final answer and we've I'm

165
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,280
in case this is needed and chain genes

166
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,130
in TCP and IP for example heaters

167
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,140
far yes and I ET issues and I think your
Wii

168
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,370
really think thats he is talking to our

169
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,690
send those creepy so

170
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,810
this introduction was just here to help
you out

171
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,230
understanding what's are honeypots but
the core of the presentation is

172
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,280
retaliation with honey but so

173
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,000
mmm I'm pretty happy to be here Idaho
conference to talk about that because

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,640
I'm

175
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,880
for example in France so we have
restriction the Willows

176
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,900
and this is not your from now

177
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,700
till June if this is legal or not to
talk about stuff like that

178
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,300
for example you don't have the right to
get explode on your own computers and

179
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,320
stuff like that but I won't talk about
that here

180
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,490
you want to talk just come on but of
lame

181
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,590
so and

182
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:31,050
during the last can sequester in
Vancouver I'm a little

183
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,010
which was gone to arterial honeypots
when the bite back

184
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,530
so Dez presentation

185
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,240
we r strongly use Sly's from when they
show

186
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,990
during consequence cause reform so

187
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,510
I said that if you honey pots of
computer resources that I double

188
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,150
to counterattack all play with an actor
so by using specifying self defense

189
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,890
techniques

190
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,670
you know a key defense good term user
counterattack

191
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,189
we not just talking about fighting off
we urge

192
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,910
we also talking about fighting back a
game

193
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,949
so imagine something like aggressor

194
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,020
that we attack your leave your honey
pots and a hit along the boards

195
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,390
we say okie you touch me but the actual

196
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,360
and we see it will hike back I we show
you example just after thats

197
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,470
don't into fits

198
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,800
okie why would we play we've

199
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,100
retaliation at first you could say

200
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,680
if we r thats people have the right to
protect himself

201
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,920
okie and you could say that's self
defense should be

202
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,579
accepted on of course this is very
difficult because

203
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,580
self defense is not something and

204
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,700
this is only must've the time something
from physical traits

205
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,660
and this is very difficult to arm talk
about that's from the digital world

206
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,089
and also it is very difficult to do
clean

207
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,880
retaliation because

208
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,430
for example in the US you don't have the
rights

209
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,889
to arm

210
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,830
protect yourself if you had

211
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,640
another solution so how could you prove
that you had no

212
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,500
over alternative solutions

213
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,470
that's very difficult and also you
answer

214
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,540
your cooter counterattack has to be

215
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,020
proportional to the attack what is
proportional for example

216
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,410
you get a DOS a denial-of-service

217
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,880
what what is proportional a DOS one why
not

218
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,960
butts you know and also if you attack
batch an ass

219
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,630
a computer other the team that was hot

220
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,029
for example I don't know that's that
could be a a very big cluster

221
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:54,570
playing with codes and two fights for
example

222
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,810
human disease

223
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,339
you we hiked back such a computer and
that's

224
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,630
not funny okay so as you might see

225
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,939
retaliation he's funny from a technical
point of view

226
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,589
but I am A G G but also I'm aware of our

227
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,800
legal issues or think about that if you
look am

228
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,310
do so so when I could was a white art
community

229
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,300
might be interesting in retaliation for
example to stop speaking think I know

230
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,180
that acts like

231
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,880
warms and also to trust stop monitor
about it internal user

232
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,329
are attackers of course and is very
interesting

233
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:36,399
burt's we have to be aware that
retaliation could be used by a black hat

234
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:36,899
people

235
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:40,860
for example to income it's automatic
crime and

236
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,450
imagine if you too honey but that will

237
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,120
hike back any kam incoming client and
thats

238
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,089
something that we'll automatically
attack clients

239
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:56,890
so thats that something very bad why

240
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,730
i'ma talking though honey pots because
John on production resources

241
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,060
so incoming traffic might be consider

242
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,610
a suspicious and should be considered as
an aggression

243
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,310
because the season on projection system
that's why this is very cool to put

244
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,230
something like

245
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,990
retaliation on honey pertz because being
if you're even Agra so might be

246
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,949
considered

247
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:22,500
I self defense montreal's so

248
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,620
hiking back the trouble is you have to
think about spooking

249
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,230
are you sure that attackers are those
who want to hike back

250
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,870
you my attack in a sense and

251
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,960
for security lorries innocent you
remember button

252
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,030
and when he's a real source of the Irish
in

253
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,730
those questions are very difficult and
also

254
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,839
am imagine

255
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,190
if hike back come become

256
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,180
legal how will you be able to prove
that's

257
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,519
as aware an incoming aggression

258
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,589
for example if you add a line in your
logs saying that yes but take on the Gov

259
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:04,709
attack me and that's why I hiked back

260
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:10,269
that's totally stupid okay and you
should go to jail so

261
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:15,699
to prove all incoming aggression will
become something very difficult and

262
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:19,769
also imagine if everybody put something
I hiked back on the Internet

263
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:25,110
automatic cutback may lead to Kairos
okay so

264
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,600
think twice before opening day to its am

265
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,280
butts hike back could be used for
internal problems and

266
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,610
of course you have the right to Penn
tests you own computers

267
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,260
in your company and most of the time so

268
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,250
if you have the right to Pinterest your
company your you own computers

269
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,930
computers that are under your legal
usually I

270
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:51,350
legal from you see where I mean

271
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:58,150
you have the right to contest so usual
you have the right to

272
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,380
attack it was almost so you might have
the rights to

273
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,599
for example hike back an end-user I
don't know

274
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,270
as your trainee trying to gets a
specific secret fight in your company

275
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,180
for example

276
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,249
butts

277
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:16,459
hike back might be very difficult for
external problem

278
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:19,839
and you might need Corp corporation for
example state between

279
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,260
seitz all companies and stuff like that

280
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,930
if we talk about the risk of spoofing

281
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,730
everybody knows idols can for example I
suppose

282
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,530
yes no I does kind he's just an example
where

283
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,560
I'm agris all will told we the targets:

284
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,460
we've all been known for example agris
or just have to send a scene

285
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,460
by spoofing your hosts they're called
zombie

286
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,830
and the targets we answer were you seen
ako resets for example

287
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,649
to the zombie

288
00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:00,929
den Agra so we just have to talk with
zombie with HC

289
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:04,049
we'll small scene ac we which is a
called

290
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:09,099
and then AP ID IPA deep Rob and a zombie
with senator resets

291
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:12,178
and depending on the fact that's

292
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,429
the targets interface

293
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:18,459
to sent a scene ac all resets

294
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,700
and the apad will change

295
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,679
on zombie for the reset response and
zeiger so we know

296
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,169
E the ball on the targets was open on
arts

297
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:32,339
an as you might see

298
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:36,479
I grew so did not talk with the targets
so but this is just

299
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:40,239
called I to scan but he's an example

300
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:44,039
funny way to attack

301
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,200
without being seen and the trouble we
hiking back

302
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,000
me that's and that may be dangerous to
hike back in the body

303
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,139
because you are not sure observer source
of fiber sir

304
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:58,460
so let's talk about retaliation with
honey pots

305
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,090
as your ID's imagine someone which is
doing

306
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,119
something bad against

307
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,209
yo honey butts and you want to reacts

308
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,179
first we could try for example to buy
back

309
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,450
usual clients

310
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,750
coming to for example your fake web
server trying to do

311
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,159
SQL injection us define its what

312
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,070
if the client used by attacker are
vulnerable or misconfigured

313
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,250
for example if you look at web clients
like Internet Explorer's

314
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,340
and s ish Lions

315
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,350
make i ans de in this was a rule IRC
clients

316
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,690
whatever they are all very honorable
okay

317
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,870
all at least job doing a goal also have
been reliable

318
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,830
an interview jurors it will be very
durable

319
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,879
as a question ease

320
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,860
is it possible to do something like a
remote control

321
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,450
are you a remote crush to for example
fight back

322
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,670
someone to try to learn attack you

323
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,740
so I played Wii something

324
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,370
just to see if it was possible we for
example

325
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,830
on this is a very old missus two years
old mister

326
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,449
and it was we've message clients must
have the time

327
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,600
on destroy like Linux distribution with
message clients

328
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,760
and it was billed the clients where
built

329
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,908
we've x11 forwarding active

330
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:28,049
you know wat is you

331
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:32,580
okay so under honeypots and that was
very easy with on ED

332
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,210
to play died at whens 'em

333
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,360
display localhost and 10

334
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,830
what when someone connected to my honey
pots because he knew

335
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,040
I for example a a real log in and the
real

336
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,450
password on my honey pots which is
something that he

337
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,860
found we've and the Overberg on my web
server

338
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,270
the display localhost

339
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,280
10 was a key palance are the remotes

340
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,899
0 so so look analysts on my honey
football

341
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,310
seeks all 10 he's ultimately collided

342
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,000
into a situation and at that time I
could play with something like

343
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,880
XWD are its by because by attacking

344
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,190
I'm to I takings a remote TCP port 6,000

345
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,030
I was very easy because by a takings a
lookout lots

346
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,660
for dBase SSH you are taxed was
ultimately

347
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,259
I'll automatically forwarded 20 attacker

348
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:39,850
so we've debts you could get

349
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,510
for example and you had a cipher

350
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,580
attack against attacker eat was a

351
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,280
for any hike back you could get as I
think your screens them

352
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,070
on honey pots and also you could gets
everything

353
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:02,320
died baeza attacker so you had to gain a
remote keylogger active

354
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,689
so that was funny because he saw that it
was a freebie is the inner

355
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,440
he went on: security focus

356
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,050
and try to find

357
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,570
berg's so that's quite funny because I'm

358
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,950
mustard and you will see that's as a
black hat we try for example

359
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,980
was aware that we get it an exploit that
they don't understand

360
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,370
there we send these exploited the world
your computers

361
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,150
they will get a show and after that so
we just type sir

362
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,370
very when you come in you named ish a

363
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,500
and see or key now I want to be rude

364
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,670
and so it will go on this web server

365
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,040
we're services thank you giving them

366
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,290
exploits to for example I booze burkina
can earn staff writer

367
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,210
so

368
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,440
that's funny because it was a was a
placard that didn't know that he was

369
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,210
spied

370
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,730
a number question this is very difficult

371
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,040
to bite back incoming clients because

372
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,360
for example you have I took I know
clients you have

373
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,550
what I I have called least link Lions
like may clients at Sutra

374
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:16,639
and he's very easy because you you have
multiple times for example if you want

375
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,310
to hike back

376
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,110
a mail client you can send multiple maze

377
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,700
butts most of the time people use for
example income

378
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,920
incoming client like with plants stir
fry dat

379
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,380
any disease a one-shot operation and
sometimes

380
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,530
so hike back can ok sure during the
specific phase

381
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,510
for example during the negotiation other
login password Obama

382
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:44,580
FTP server and something I that's and
also you need specific information to

383
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,280
launch

384
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,000
added Katie attack against the client

385
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,450
for example you need knows operating
system you need to know the version

386
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,520
as a playdate and idea in

387
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,970
and is an example of them a hike back

388
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,140
other beauty clients you know if she's a
Sichuan

389
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,750
Windows at that didn't work heat was
trying to say San

390
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,330
to launch a remote exec

391
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,789
on the plains

392
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:15,510
but that's very difficult butts that
might that might exist

393
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:19,390
and the question is is possible to
explode

394
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,929
exploits

395
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,809
imagine someone launch in exploits
against you

396
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,970
and the guy and you get a shell owns a
guy on the script

397
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,840
key that's funny so

398
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,918
question its is what users vulnerability
is a cold oven exploits

399
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,039
and you know like it before floor
string.format

400
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,710
so

401
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,670
do you hear reads cordova exploits

402
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,280
before launching its abrasion on the
answer is No

403
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,260
and I'm also pretty sure there's on
Surrey's I don't read too paid

404
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,040
also muscles time and you know some
people towards

405
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,220
funny stuff in the payload like for my
the remote host

406
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,640
all comments are looking to host or
something like that so

407
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,120
I'm script kiddies don't understand the
sources

408
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,279
%uh exploit the use

409
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:09,909
weekend we can see some time on the
internet people coming on the years

410
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:13,120
I R CC when I launch de comer

411
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,860
HBO exploit Nazi you be did not walk

412
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,200
what can I do you combine its complied

413
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,210
what do you mean okie go away

414
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,179
so I'm pretty sure that script kiddies
Dunstan's explodes use

415
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,580
and if you look at the code sometimes
you can see exploits burt's

416
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,340
she's like rosa but with clients and
staff writer this is very fickle

417
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,610
an if you look at this automatic tools
used to launch a remote attacked

418
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,160
all the deets

419
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,440
they are eaten properly for example if
you look at niece who's

420
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,910
as he created something which is cool
any SL

421
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,820
to get something like a small sandbox

422
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,639
while launching are security problems

423
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,730
and also for Korean pacts which is very
cool too

424
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,590
this rezoning my phone and also see our
something like

425
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,630
the use of small preview age and

426
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,700
some kind of sandbox and she probably
did that because in no

427
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,470
thats as there is a risk so that may
exist also

428
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,059
what about scanners as there are many
kind of scanners that are using the Y

429
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,660
like net warriors banners security tests

430
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,670
and some of them are poorly designed
from security phone interview

431
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,960
and my lead to in security and

432
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,990
we so much rain we saw befall the flow
possible

433
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,220
and from the strings again scanners for
example

434
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,410
resource can't we so I i will. I won't
give the name

435
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:45,700
and goes a DMCA restriction and stuff
like that

436
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,570
we saw scanners I for example trying to
gets to grab your banner

437
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,570
view on FTP server and

438
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,450
waiting for something which had

439
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,830
one thousand 24 bytes

440
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,869
okay an issue or FTP server had a very
busy

441
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:13,099
banner neck you know I am FTP server FTP
server FTP server FTP server FTP server

442
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:16,539
and which was to be

443
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:20,269
you had a possibility to make a follow
through on the client's

444
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:24,450
arms on the scanner so that's quite
funny because this is a reverse

445
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,489
abuse you usual game and

446
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:31,059
on the Internet and also we so some

447
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:35,769
reports but he's inherited for example
we've ash Tamil

448
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:39,769
including banners grabs a target weevil
checking data

449
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:43,929
so you could put for example by near
from you FTP server

450
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,759
we've JavaScript code inside ovitz

451
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:53,489
and when's a Eve Myles pp was trying to
lewke acts as a security reports

452
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:58,239
Anna you could launch called on his
computer

453
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:01,429
and that's quite funny so

454
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,489
for scanners that may be possible what
about

455
00:28:04,489 --> 00:28:09,909
high on self train horses what Eve there
is a really RB teens ago the tryna holes

456
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:13,690
brian's how many times here
administrators

457
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,779
you get an incoming prime prop Ryan boss

458
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,129
the world you into network for me that's
everyday

459
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:24,029
every every day and ivory however we
have

460
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:27,549
so many probs so imagine

461
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:30,559
a navy honey but that would be able to
answer to the

462
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,070
and clients and say

463
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,999
yes i'ma trying to host server I'm
waiting for you all orders

464
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:42,519
what should I do me then a counterattack

465
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,649
might be possible here's an example
technical example we've

466
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:49,710
honey D that's why I show you an idea at
the beginning

467
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,980
by adding a very easy line 0

468
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,769
configuration which is I don't play TC
people 1,2,3,4,5 launch

469
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:02,070
do fake net use ball screens

470
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,499
which is kinda back and you i'd

471
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:09,039
and abusive rice on your fake come here
and

472
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,639
series who called the I've & Fitch

473
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:15,769
remotes need use and server

474
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:18,240
that we on sir I am

475
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,660
to the client's and you as you can see
when the play and connects you just say

476
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,150
yes

477
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:27,190
I am in it new server 1.6 which means
what should I do

478
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,530
any is a plan for example beacons a boat
on

479
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,230
my shoes get info but they could do for
every button

480
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,320
then and

481
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,350
is a fake am need your server Sen

482
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,020
for example

483
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,530
100,000 a and

484
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,810
and was waiting for the answer other as
a client

485
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:53,610
and here's what happened so first

486
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,730
to Netvouz guy and he's gone acted so
you can imagine is creepy

487
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,330
yet year okay I get one I get a new one

488
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:07,270
I found the net new server on the
Internet then by clicking on to get info

489
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,610
as you can see on za be Tournament 2 the
CPU went

490
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,480
chrome increase to own one hundred
persons and then

491
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,760
QC gonna after that as you might see am

492
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,240
this is an anti fine States cousin
edgar's kaelin's

493
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,540
okay so this is not something like

494
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,830
you get a shell on the attacker burt's
you keel

495
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,240
application that try to attack for
example you company

496
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,260
so I don't know if this can be called

497
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:41,360
proportional answer but that's very
interesting from a technical point of

498
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:41,690
view

499
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,730
I think that the to speak to you was
afraid when he saw that

500
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,960
so and I'm a question ease

501
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,670
it possible to fight back warms for
example imagine

502
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:59,070
in your company on your internet woke
you up a very big problem like a warm

503
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,810
remember suddenly summer

504
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,060
last year we've Deacom exploits

505
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,080
and

506
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,240
as a.m. is blessed Swan I'm it was on

507
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,260
your holy bull for many company

508
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,740
in the world so the question is is it
possible to fight back ones

509
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,990
so this is something I roads in secret
recuse can find and

510
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,120
find its I was a paper on security book
is not come

511
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,440
and which was cool fighting Internet
worms with honey but

512
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,610
and also I made a presentation during
the Black Cat in as your

513
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,630
Singapore on dat that subjects but

514
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:39,420
hmm to show you very fast me

515
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,950
and here is a theory imagine we ever
warm cold W

516
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,070
that combs w is for one

517
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,899
is not on something else I'm not talking
about political

518
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,400
things okay and so a long cold W

519
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,750
comes from a host school a to host cost

520
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,050
call ash as because this is a honeypot I
say that for people

521
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,639
well sleeping it so

522
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,240
a is infected by W okay

523
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,450
because A's trying for example to

524
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:17,099
propagates itself to

525
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:20,769
age okay so a ease all was

526
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:25,630
may deepen vulnerable to attack used by
the warm

527
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,799
so a may still be be tolerable

528
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,059
so what he NH the honeypot

529
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:37,220
attacks a fruity smell your ability it
means that's so funny but scan takes

530
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:37,980
control

531
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,399
so exhaust that is infected by the warm

532
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:44,890
so what is a honeypot takes controls a
host

533
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:49,700
infected by the warm by using these were
in the RBT and try to clean the hosts

534
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,610
to budget host

535
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:54,929
and two how turns a host and for example
to reboot then

536
00:32:54,929 --> 00:33:00,929
only real hot 100 watts we you can clean
1000 and thousands of computers

537
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:04,140
the trouble is I said

538
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,690
visits legal I'll week we can say that

539
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:12,999
for example when I wrote that

540
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,730
I was also on Slashdot he'd

541
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,320
because I've thats and

542
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,158
people said disease this is forbidden to
hike back

543
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,120
yes this might be forbidden but on your
legal

544
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,669
on internal network you can play Wii
debt

545
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:30,769
and you can save

546
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:34,059
powers and how urs by just few lines of
code

547
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:37,418
for example news our lines of code

548
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:41,200
we've honey to disapprove of concepts

549
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,889
on that show and it shows how to fire

550
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,570
an even fight back a name is blessed
Swan on a network

551
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,200
that's very easy you just have to say

552
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,299
I want to launch discrete when a warm
he's trying to

553
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:00,190
when im is buses trains common mind
computer me honey but

554
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,940
and then here's a causa Cody just okays

555
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,080
send a naval explodes two worlds a
incoming

556
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,790
and warm infected computer

557
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,119
an and then you have a shale and then
you try to relight

558
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,740
this is for XP Windows XP you try for
example to

559
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,010
but the skills and his bluster TD
process then you try to do let's

560
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,119
the final buzzer long then you try to
him

561
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,149
cleans a registry then you and try to
reboot to host and Sophia

562
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:35,150
toys as you might it is very easy okay

563
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:38,740
you can do very very cool thing I what
about the way your this

564
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:44,280
for its an I wrote a paper about wiring
this honey but

565
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,110
when it was cool Wireless honey but we
carry on security to talk is that come

566
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,440
and I talk about the fact that there are

567
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,510
if you're horny boats into wireless
world

568
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,420
yes sometimes you can be

569
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,829
you can see for example unofficial
access point we fix resources

570
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:05,130
for example here he someone launch
something

571
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,050
we were SAT which is hope

572
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,690
dash year if I think on Channel

573
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,720
free for example

574
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,070
we've very BBC no what will happen for
example

575
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,600
and some people might think that this is
a real

576
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,600
network beds it may be a fake one so

577
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:29,328
sometime we can see rogue access points

578
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:32,900
which are used into wide to attack to
automatically

579
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,500
at their clients because the problem for
example if you

580
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,700
you take you a train your manager you
open your laptop

581
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,180
you don't know that you either way or
discarding to Kenya for example in your

582
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,810
computer

583
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,450
an where you are traveling a navy guy

584
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,618
in the train for example we launch a
fake

585
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,040
access points annual computer Windows XP
which is

586
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,329
so kind with you we automatically

587
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:02,430
connect itself who was a fake access
point and

588
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:06,078
say I want an IP address so the fake
access point we just had

589
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,630
here is your IP address and imagine what
will happen

590
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,650
me for example and this manager don't
have the best not a final

591
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,849
on these computer and

592
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:25,420
something like SSS Rd come exploit and
stuff like that we'll probably watch

593
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,650
and by troubling I know you one hour or
two hours

594
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:33,920
on he's sensitive data will be taken

595
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,030
out from the computer so

596
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,290
and also

597
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:43,829
we can see in the way of this world
stuff like while drivers trying to open

598
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:47,960
access points and stuff and playing and
trying to creates

599
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,300
tuning and two grew 23 go

600
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,120
out on the Internet so

601
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,750
there is an example of two who knows the
two local

602
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,760
Ennis T weeks okay and

603
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,800
the school this is very cool I don't
know how do you

604
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,890
fine its he's a very cool too that's
lows you

605
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,279
to surf and to use the internets weaves
2px this point

606
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,640
without being

607
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,640
again and ID ease most of the time

608
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,770
on some access points you have the right

609
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,680
to do DNS queries

610
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,390
what T you query

611
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,368
your own DNS server somewhere on the
internets

612
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:35,440
and these and use

613
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,569
not really real questions %uh

614
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:40,490
DNS butts

615
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:44,640
specific DNS questions which are and in
fact

616
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,190
I P over a DNS and he's

617
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,849
exists he's cool NXT EX and it's very
easy to to use

618
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:56,369
so when we looked on that

619
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,549
with my friends from zoo the team
everest yesterday

620
00:37:59,549 --> 00:38:04,150
we found a dis sever could be crushed
remotely

621
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,210
with a review on the port we something
like

622
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,790
on the 19 of Birr

623
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,980
so that's very easy night was fall for
zone for his vision other entities

624
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,300
is just to show you that there is a
Fritz

625
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,090
also was a Fritz different was what
these people you something like Ennis TX

626
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,390
and by walking

627
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:30,720
owns the tombs used by you enemy you can
find her in there are BT's

628
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,980
and easy create your own possibilities
to fight

629
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,050
to fight off

630
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,810
so now let's look at what can be done in
za honey boats

631
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,299
for example sometimes people try to
steal fis

632
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,090
in your honey buns became so

633
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,450
what he ugueth are trapped for example

634
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,130
what he an attacker a download read and
launch

635
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,220
for example tools from me honey pots
like

636
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,420
if you AG are dock lines so

637
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,810
imagine what issue you put some things
like a No

638
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,359
Britney dots mp3

639
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,840
all Britney dirty Kia of something like
that

640
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,150
you a fun this is a young attacker

641
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:22,210
he would probably takes a fire and
bringing back to home

642
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,280
to show in to look it's with them to
look at it

643
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,730
with his friends on Saturday night's
paid looking I gotta bring it to the

644
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,500
Defiant thats might be cool

645
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:36,460
yeah that's cool on sheets and

646
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:42,480
there is a button technology which she's
coming from a commercial

647
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,640
I'm project which is called Specter
Sivan

648
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,690
that would add markers on I thinking
hosts

649
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,619
for petitioner attention trial but I
i've never tested

650
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:58,390
so weekly Magin something like dishes
and

651
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,180
and explode written by someone from from
a team I'm

652
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,980
key routes hero than exploits that
allows you to get a remote shell

653
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,240
on someone lookin

654
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,400
I world documents that you gave him

655
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,710
so imagine you create something called

656
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,700
superclass if I dot dot file

657
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,780
in a dot secrets and directory

658
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,609
you just have to wait that is creepy
take its and really the home

659
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:31,190
that's funny you can get a Schilens a

660
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,550
on the go so some people talk about

661
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,609
the possibility a for the REA honeypots

662
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:40,490
an

663
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,730
okay I won't comment its

664
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,490
because I'm and 112 problem

665
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,110
am

666
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,080
as you can see on the internets on
security book is not come

667
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,450
its there's something reason by goebbels
said

668
00:40:55,450 --> 00:41:01,480
we focus on creating very warm he breeds
to infect and spread the word p2p nets

669
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,080
so the question is steal this album that
mean

670
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,788
be compromised we don't know

671
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:12,920
this might be something I mean

672
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,870
honey but to fight like and maybe
something that

673
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,040
will be used by people that want to
fights

674
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,830
p2p client and sulfate I wanted he's
wrong all

675
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,600
BC's not drawn I'm not here for
political discussion but just technical

676
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,930
discussion

677
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,020
so let's talk about monitoring the trap

678
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,030
and we're gonna have fun so

679
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:40,550
am something that may be very useful for
you

680
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:45,190
ease trying to do I'm to trust back

681
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:49,380
attacker do you want to get over it
extending the formation about that occur

682
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,619
and this may be very useful

683
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:56,960
on local network users not too much
history on you into network

684
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,980
and sometime if you see I'm as you look
trini

685
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,740
all someone on your network for example
on

686
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,930
you by justice mmm requesting

687
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,060
on just asking questions to remote
servers

688
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,580
you will be able to find extending
information goes out the Cure

689
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,210
all is a guy who is trying to play on a
network for example

690
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,440
you can use to fly finger a user's i'd
in the

691
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,510
here is an example we honey a small and
distribute to him

692
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,589
two-career remote identity

693
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:31,890
you can ask for example ended by use
back for

694
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:35,500
server who is connected to this computer
and stuff it

695
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,339
but bettors either simple meds are also
some

696
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:44,390
over pussy beatty's I'm if you've tried
to Luke

697
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:49,040
some network and possibilities you will
see that's

698
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,270
am you can do advance it backtracking
for example you can do act even perceive

699
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,970
fingerprinting with honey but most of
the time people

700
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,810
talk about perceive operating system

701
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:05,299
fingerprint for example we've to Lake Rd

702
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,420
like both on the who which is commercial
to very useful

703
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,050
am all tools like Ryan Rossiter you can
do

704
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:17,690
which is cool for example some time pass
even operating system fingerprint

705
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,530
because you want to go over is more
information you can Undertaker

706
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:25,450
a key so here's a very

707
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:29,860
easy example other innovate innovative
at: fingerprints but

708
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,560
that's that's very easy you just have to
play Wii which is cool

709
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:37,040
to close waging a free in honey D
fingerprint

710
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,040
and this is an example we honey D how to
do it I i don't have so much time

711
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,730
I will let you look at the size the
state rebuildable

712
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,510
online on my aunt a website parity as
you get up ok session we do

713
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,090
for you so to finish me off any

714
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,310
mastery he here is a Truman Show honey
butts

715
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,710
so elite are inside the honey but

716
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,450
so sometimes people want to talk with
strangers

717
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,510
IQ on you know we always seem

718
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,780
know your enemy no lights into book

719
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,770
so you want to know you anyway one of
the best ways to talk we've

720
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,370
the enemy Anna just go out to the sure

721
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,339
givin police and two playing with
discipline with people and

722
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,800
gonna be fun and usually black had get
access

723
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,830
play and go away on your host you don't
have any opportunity to interact with

724
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:31,230
them

725
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:35,020
but you would like to talk with them so
what can you do that's funny

726
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,090
you can use your discretion we've got a
curse for example to do you mind

727
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,480
technical fingerprint

728
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,480
get more proves more fires that Acura
get a location

729
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,560
do action jeans headphone whatever

730
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,620
so you can use classical tools like
right talk

731
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:54,440
ir CSUN surfrider butts on honey pots

732
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,880
this might be very easy for example you
want if you want to play Wii SoCon

733
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,520
January

734
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,550
now with human aggressors you can force
attackers on your own computer

735
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,980
you can comment always intruders NC
Heidi diehards box to

736
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:13,130
I wanna share stuff I every access
everywhere in separate

737
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,850
the intruder will try to guess where you
are from

738
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,910
okay and if description is

739
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,170
on the honey pots as a intruders we

740
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,300
play with tools like net starts who

741
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,830
W yes stuff a dats okie Mets

742
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,380
as this is your honey pots you controls
a honeypot

743
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,980
is your show okay so you can change
everything

744
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,000
ever feeling like his incoming IP IP
address

745
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,490
on your computer coming to your honey
pots

746
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,190
so you just have to for example boots

747
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,720
filtering computer that will change your
incoming IP address we've nets

748
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,730
and you can change sheets to spoof

749
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:59,000
and to say that's you come from a look
and learn and wide

750
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,980
coming from a look and then you can look
like being your coming from a

751
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,180
adults Yendo Teru whatever again

752
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,149
sold see very easy on you get which you
just have to use nets and say

753
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,670
on zine owns a gay way and you just have
to change

754
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,500
IP address incoming IP address and you
can see claim that you calm

755
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,160
krummel where you want you want to say
that you come from

756
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,819
Lionel well as the Gov you you can
change the IP address and a gay will

757
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,390
we'll see

758
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:30,500
team that's you are really coming from
that there is a small screams

759
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,410
on from the French onion at project we
spot that was a fun italians

760
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,879
and witches and Truman Show honey but
for her concept

761
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,610
as you might see just be like two tables
tutions IP source

762
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,180
this is very and here I lobes coming
from

763
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,520
one over our honeypots so

764
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,750
the Blackhearts and it came on the power

765
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,910
on ebert's and in style the small boats
IRC boats

766
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,549
to downs to an IRC private server

767
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:04,050
I love themselves and we went

768
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,460
from the honeypot on their IRC server

769
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,100
and initiated a DQ Shin and say you may
see

770
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,700
as I said hello and I say hi

771
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,150
I some discomfort your before you

772
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:20,449
is against it I know I said

773
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:23,839
how and he said ID faster than you

774
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,619
at ITM okay let's try where I am from
you know

775
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:31,069
that the tree he said France because if
anybody's inference

776
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:34,650
and I say no so intruder

777
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:37,829
very skilled launch in established in

778
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:41,430
to see who was really easier a key an

779
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:46,029
your he got my app fake IP address
changed by is a Nats

780
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,630
and so thats it was coming from
Singapore and he said

781
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,910
Singapore I said of course which means

782
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:56,180
welcome in The Truman Show honeypots
okie

783
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,359
and it was quite funny because after

784
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:04,680
few min YouTube discusion I knew that Z
had fewer printed that it was a VMware

785
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,249
and I'm I knew that there we're trying
to crush your hard drive

786
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:13,109
on mine how many boats and also I
understand

787
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:16,819
very easy that's the way a train to for
example

788
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:19,880
abuse of c3

789
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,420
on my system and supply that's so that
may be very funny to play like that

790
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,829
parents conclusion and they are over
fears of interest but

791
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:31,950
we don't have so much time some people
try to to do

792
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,339
something each which is called boomerang
effect you proxies aggression absurd to

793
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:37,740
cure back to the greaser

794
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,160
which may be funny and stuff like that
would you do a detour on separate

795
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,288
again and in brief honey but may play a
role

796
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:49,799
for retaliation counterattack I'll play
with tiger so by using specific serb

797
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:50,829
defense techniques

798
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:54,660
we talk about active defense Quinter
Missouri counterattack

799
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,200
so played at sometimes you can get a
remote control

800
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,579
are you can't rub that occur if boys on
the east you can gather more information

801
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:06,380
you can crash tools used by the
attackers for white tights

802
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:09,640
Wendys is legal okay I said and the

803
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,850
this may be useful to abide by CAG
resources

804
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,339
for example on your on land I said that
might be

805
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:20,360
very useful for Black Cats

806
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,570
I miss agree thats and this may be a new
way to

807
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:28,100
personally attacking coming be tours and
I know that's

808
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,800
guys from

809
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,370
use Europe use my techniques to fight
off

810
