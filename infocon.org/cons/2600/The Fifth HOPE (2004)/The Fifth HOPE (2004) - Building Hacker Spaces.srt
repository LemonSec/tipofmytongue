67
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,489
a let's get out is a tool P pro 200

68
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:13,329
it's blazing fast a but this is kinda
like what we work in

69
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,719
better network area and we have just Joe
workshop

70
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:20,799
love a spare hard whirling around
anything we need without having

71
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:24,589
house mercy trash picked or decommission
from other

72
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:27,769
locations this workspace that they close
empty

73
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:30,949
unless it is our landlords the event

74
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:35,199
some people nor and this is you for the
roof

75

so yeah and here's the end no scruple
things

76
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,629
this is the sex for us it's a hundred
dollars

77
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,999
per person per month to run this

78
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:50,879
it's a bell we have

79
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,919
E over remembers 6 people are reliable

80
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,399
for cash every month it's great it's
very important it stings for you to keep

81
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,289
those two things

82
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,649
there six people who always give us
money and sometimes as people relate

83
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:05,059
sometimes

84
00:06:05,059 --> 00:06:08,069
not not because they tend to be event

85
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:12,209
same thing our parents by doctor neck
doctrine expand our service

86
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:17,449
is from net access dot com

87
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,439
a and our core products mostly internal
maintenance right now

88
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,219
doing get ok a lower and supporting some
orders our community

89
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,329
our core problems I'll be dead his
organization

90
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:32,299
very poorly organized part-time people
to rescue things

91
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:36,279
and that's over yet it's funny hours
it's all over

92
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:39,808
calls and so we had has is very high
expert expectations

93
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:43,469
what we want to do we have the rest as
expectations over time to realize what

94
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:43,989
people's

95
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:47,659
free time actually was so turned

96
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:54,659
over to the east issue step

97
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,969
what he called history

98
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:04,800
well used to be a used to be a bakery

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,860

100
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,589
was not license to be a bakery was a
renegade

101

website too so I'll

111
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,369
here we have the AC pastry that's our
electronics

112
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:58,459
work workbench we've got a

113
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:01,989
my is working on the the sunrise a Linux
distribution

114
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:05,479
gotta another workstation here that's
mine

115
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,679

camp that's where we keep the kemp

117
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:20,589
he cracked this is this is our idea of a

118
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:24,529
you know coehlo space spray for men
jerseys

119
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:31,529
every hackerspace you'll see duct tape
on the go mass hits hard

120
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,509
joint running but many moose

121
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:40,979
history its its as invaders in reference
there

122
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,149
here's a

123
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,529
for an area the space wanna things learn
with

124
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,399
with new hacked was which is very good
to use or display

125
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,939
here's your fun area here's your project
workspace

126
00:08:55,939 --> 00:09:01,939
you know separate is a LCD projector
there too so for watching movies and

127
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:05,299
used up a phone that works the lady on
the backs

128
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:08,549
over from the loft people pay reference
to

129
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:13,389
explain infamous law also

130
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:20,389
Victoria you know reference out to
discover ok backup

131
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:25,540
tobacco Farrell Corp

132
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,990
the you ruined Christmas

133
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,689
it's a macintosh it's a macintosh that's
the problem see

134
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:40,559
we Weiner's we don't understand what's
called

135
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,689
so

136
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:46,880
here there's another shot at the space
yet that the lady there

137
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,959
on the area over by that wall down there

138
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,569
showdown at the basement yes there was
no picture

139
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:58,279
no I'm dude I'm sorry

140
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,730
shut shoes is

141
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,149
Reichelt can't be photographed image
from

142
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,230
his added is the embodiment fear

143
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,240
the lead so ever had the experience for

144
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,839
you know 2600 their site group early
people

145
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,449
and and they're certainly new people
Anne

146
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:23,169
want to approach the lead but the catch

147
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,720
they can go over there might have some
have a question can make it over there

148
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,329
that's the spirit of culture who
sacrifices chickens and stuff to this

149
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:31,850
thing through

150
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,470
here and now every hackerspace

151
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,519
has a shrine which insurers religious
thing

152
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,980
Testament bus mister T friends our cats
you

153
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,779
on here's the other is peace tax we have

154
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,019
6 regular contributors pay between 150
and 200

155
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:54,240
I recommends not paying anything more
than

156
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,509
200 a person care how much you make you
know

157
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:02,990
previously we've go back to Russia with

be there to help you

162
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,600
you know do all these different research
projects and get together and

163
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,990
organize and you end up spending so much
time

164
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,169
just working on the environment getting
it to a state you can work on

165
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:37,470
amen its how we work on you know sunrise
clinics

166
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,910
some publication the sonic beating

167
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,870
serve site trance dance

168
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,539
by binaries binaries webs 15,000 watt PA

169
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:53,279
and various you know sort ac/dc related
projects

170
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,519
this space compared to you know other
spaces

171
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,730
you know I've dealt with very you know
cramped for that the number people a

172
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,470
number like

173
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:08,470
you know equipment have the projects we
have going on

174
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,139
so the next the next move is a new hack
City

175
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:15,179
I'd like to see it he was founded in
1989

176
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,630
yet next city was originally house

177
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,839
in Allston Massachusetts arm which these
guys like that

178
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,500
there is a is acker house with no I
sichuan talk a little bit about the

179
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,660
other accident

180
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,269
has no place for their freedom was there
silicosis was there to revision CBC was

181
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,000
there

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,269
various other people and basically I'm
it was a

183
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,819
to develop the place to take into
refugees from other hacker houses and

184
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:43,949
accurately that houses that fallen apart
various reasons

185
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:47,299
the respected center but it was nice in
it

186
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,470
when we moved into the house it had yes
the basement was

187
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,509
kitty litter in sewage on and

188
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,360
the landlord a crazy Israeli guy was
nice enough to basically say

189
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,970
if you pay for the if you do that would
yet he basically what haps and picked up

190
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,509
the basement

191
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:05,899
you know put in a cement floor wired it
all up

192
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:08,939
inflated it in turn it into it sweet

193
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:15,689
happens based on a project space

194
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:18,829
we painted the flora circuit board dream
and

195
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:23,449
goal races all along and we built our
own benches

196
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:26,459
we had you know number like

197
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,470
scenes that were hanging from chains the
wall which

198
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,959
our desk space sorry no plan was to

199
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,919
to actually leave a space in the cement
so we could put hard drives in it so

200
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:41,409
if that the Fed's ever came we can to
have stuff mounted in cement

201
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:46,649
we can actually you he jokes but we were
actually very concerned about yeah those

202
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,199
types of things during her death

203
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,490
yeah after you after euphoria kinda

204
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,909
dead yes I actually visit this afternoon

205
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:59,559
taxes just the thing i hack city is rich
is this hacker house the next city west

206
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,449
which no one

207
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:04,829
Swiss postal lol packed up and moved to
California California Nepal the dot-com

208
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:05,730
called

209
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,779
and some a bus me in rose red went back
in explore the new Mac city you stand

210
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,730
the people who live there hadn't been in
the basement all because there was no

211
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,569
electricity

212
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:17,640
so they hadn't that there was so much
computers and bullshit in the basement

213
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,579
and a fire hydrant still running which
was pretty cool

214
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,850
yeah as many Thai when everyone went to
the west coast before the dot-com gold

215
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,309
and Iran have these nice jobs where we
can afford three hundred dollars a month

216
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:30,069

217
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,890
you know throwin about money for a band

222
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,279
a lot of fun I can remember a lot of it
I

223
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,689
thinking you've actually been hacked I
remembered Panasonic

224
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,939
yeah because it's so wet weather slide

225
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,909
slide I think it's like the first big
difference when you actually East

226
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:05,679
actually West was next to US had a hot
tub yeah that's right

227
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,159
this'll be found at actually check found
Chuck the architect was here

228
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,279
god bless us all champagne a

229
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,980
drugs that make it if they found out the
hot ebony you know it's california's

230
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,140
it's actually part the building code you
have to build a hot tub into any space

231
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,559
at your building into

232
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,640
sewer so we had a heart to we had a big
heart attack in a lotta parties and

233
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,350
stuff like that were able to raise a lot
of money

234
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,589
through those kinds of things like a lot
of goodwill with a lot of presentations

235
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,380
like GSM cracking and stuff like that
people would you like press conferences

236
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,029
from there

237
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:36,569
and try to host a lotta stuff and host
us up on our servers

238
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,839
arm did on me or two yet but I think me

239
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,049
media outreach yeah I was like a lotta
media work we did a we

240
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:48,189
yet there is a back office launches from
there also are and

241
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:53,260
X oh yes I so I samawah coming and going
about that we had maybe 10 core people

242
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,689
over maybe 20-30 people in the in the
pinhole comedian exit the West went on

243
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,500
for about

244
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,000
copyright 1997 when we first got the
place a minute another space yet picked

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,240
up this one building

246
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,789
because we kept on breaking into the
billing give us to keep begins to medico

247
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:09,029
key is its cost like $50 dollars to
replicate cuz it's like that angle cut

248
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,159
and we argue that we could just

249
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,459
with the door which is kinda broke a
lock on the building a category airs

250
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:14,250
Intel

251
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,409
yet it was a pretty tight or their so
they went into the ghetto 6 the market

252
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:19,179
which is like

253
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,549
people piss and shit on the sidewalks
are top and

254
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:26,179
actually had people trying to hide
behind me to smoke crack

255
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:29,480
happens like her a

256
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,309
that actually got to count towards
veggies our community service hours for

257
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:33,659

258

280
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:52,710
I am I'm we talk about the original of
this is the original a server no I'm

281
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,230
kidding

282
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,230
this is actually a good shortwave radio
and California that I was working on

283
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,230
but up the original of term I was
founded by

284
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,899
base lose me and Brian oblivion way back
in nineteen ninety-two

285
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:09,549
and was it space in the South End Boston

286
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,740
in the it was a building that used to be
like a

287
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,830
factory there's like no oil-soaked

288
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,980
floors which is really nice for like
fire hazard staff

289
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,580
and a.m. it started back in nineteen
ninety-two in a factory

290
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,019
yeah I was looking for all pictures like
the only ones I could find like his old

291
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:31,350
640 by 480 gifts that I had as an
advertisement for the BBS

292
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,830
eighty DT which was

293
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,230
as as a rule here her to the loft by the
way the original

294
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,760
after a hand up for the last is a latest
response ever heard

295
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,059
by BFB the laughter as well as as a long
time

296
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,279
really great history i mean it started
out to you know basically is a

297
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,970
space for us to store crap and %uh this
is an original picture it's Brian

298
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,929
oblivion back when he used to wear a hat

299
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,019
English everywhere all the time all the
time we wanted like if he had a plea

300
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:04,779
in his head or something wrong with his
head cuz he always had a hat

301
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:10,669
and at the bottom it says adventures at
the loft home with a TD /td 617 350

302
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:11,450
stiff

303
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,330
that was our dialup non the pictures
them Jackson all the vaccine are coming

304
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,730
so this is an example of the above the
initial

305
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,019
this is think back 1992 sherman's at the
Wayback Machine

306
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:25,700
to 1992 and all we were primarily
concerned with initially was basically

307
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,850
getting together manuals getting
together printed material

308
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,750
and hardware that was our main focus so
this is a picture i saw the U Haul

309
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,950
width 100 manuals are literally truck or
minerals

310
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,620
there's a Brian oblivion with his book
zen and the art of codes

311
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,679
you look so young he looks to where we
also young back

312
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,799
us and there the vaccine

313
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:51,450
the app we actually we were well I
productions I we would do

314
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,950
was as we would look for people like
primarily academic institutions are

315
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,960
upgrading their mainframe hardware and
we were just like

316
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,620
basically would put out you know on
Usenet like thing saying basically like

317
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,039
if you come with the truck you can take
it please because we

318
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,570
it weighs 2,000 pounds so we would we
would like yeah sure will rent the U

319
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,309
Haul bring in the loft

320
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:16,100
and these are that these attacks in it
says our wildlife photographer spots the

321
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,059
vaccine grazing peacefully in a shaded
grover

322
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,759
buildings your picture jack to crack
smoker

323
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,029
now but I'm explains why the problems we
have the original of but

324
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:29,149
so anyway I am up back it up

325
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:32,179
so there it is you can see a VAX 11 750

326
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,380
in an on natural habitat the

327
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,320
now he said all these bad boys up and we
carried 'em up

328
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,620
a flight of stairs and I still that that
sucked my knees remembered every time it

329
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,289
rains

330
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:49,629
I it's wonderful theirs is an upper back
you see I could get like the pillows cuz

331
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,950
we're trying to keep him from bouncing
around too much

332
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,309
I'm writing back in a truck with
oblivion back from New Jersey picking up

333
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,149
these babies in like the rolling around
in the back

334
00:20:58,149 --> 00:21:04,259
and I said like she wouldn't be needed
like a freak got killed by a computer

335
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:07,940
so anyway it was soap this is there is
some really like

336
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,630
you know initially it was just staring
into space you know this bag 1992 so

337
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,130
knows 100 150 monies per member there
probably about Cyrus and her additional

338
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,690
people grew over time

339
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,519
your band with cost it was as dial-up
yeah

340
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,630
the 34 and did you get it police line

341
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,019
unknowing I well I was later but
initially that was funny too because

342
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:35,769
I am your initial contributors members
six people

343
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:38,940
core projects all we work in concerned
about was just like getting a computer's

344
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,809
fucking connected to each other and
somehow magically

345
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,470
getting it connect to a network dune and
it was initially the initial thing that

346
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,070
started us really getting serious about
getting our computers networked over

347
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:52,320
Galax tenn.-based to was doomed came out

348
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,610
and that was now is the drive is ours

349
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,429
basically reserved it was you know we
wanted to be able to

350
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:03,970
blast the hell out of each other with
rockets and I'm

351
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,780
and so our core projects member this is
10 over twelve years ago was really just

352
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,059
internal networking

353
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,960
and hardware acquisition and the core
problems eventually well you know

354
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,169
certainly a problem spaces evolve over
time and that's when the things you have

355
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,049
to realize when you start a space

356
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:21,179
initially was a was very much serve a
communal kinda

357
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,799
communistic socialist kinda environment
we just landed a get together have fun

358
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,668
in

359
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:29,570
you know watch videos and do cool
projects and eventually commercial and

360
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,450
people are interested in taking things
more commercial now is called evolved

361
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,559
over time

362
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,620
I'm but it's important to remember those
kinds of things we set up a space and I

363
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,580
remember

364
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,639
I am you notice realizing at the moment
when its urs are changing to become more

365
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,650
commercial its

366
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:47,120
everything evolves over time so you can
expect which is set up to be frozen

367
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,789
go far any other problem he had was
crack actually it was problem

368
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:54,780
we had pizza smoking crack on the
loading dock outside in front of space

369
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,129
and and we had that makes it took some
pictures and we had some

370
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,500
shannon has his old stickers from some
previous hopes

371
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,760
and a big stash others were the air mata
was

372
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,260
a the loft more fun in a pipe fourth
crack

373
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,429
it 0 I mean a picture someone lighten up
was great

374
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:14,720

near the front the door

375
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,340
i'm talking about. the what the VCR see
articles the broker

376
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,370

377
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,490
are to call our cell phones they took my
copy of heavy metal

378
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,030

that they still

379
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,440
and this is not a lie this was before it
was released okay so this is a bootleg

380
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,460
copy I was so fucking piss actually
slept on the couch

381
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,010
for a week after that with my shotgun
waiting for the fucker to come back

382
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,260
isolation I'm you taking your wrist
rocket to the

383
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,100
to tactical our studio interest rock
enemies to shoot ball bearings that the

384
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:48,770
people she

385
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,210
the stuff iron a crack in the loading
dock and

386
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,580
this mike is likely when wanna hit 'em
but we like shoot next release parks

387
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:59,340
planner just like

388
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,090
didn't faze him so is at the time is
funny cuz was in the south end right now

389
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,820
it's very

390
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,780
now fancy Tony can area but at the time
was real kinda sketchy

391
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,809
I'm but you are some other things you
have to think about when you're sitting

392
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:14,110
up space a physical environment around
you at the time we were in a real

393
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,320
ghetto so alright so we're moving right
along

394
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,399
where's the wireless mic

395
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:28,400
handed to the next person in a few

396
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,429
so here to talk about was ski

397
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,600
just happens to be in S wanted house we
all like risk in this country don't

398
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,360
weigh

399
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,590
the

400
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,070
what you think it means

401
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:50,360
pictured here you can see the squad at
houses both Martin monuments

402
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,900
city monument once a national monument

403
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,710
happen to be in the senate City Peter

404
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,830
and naturally that's at a very pretty
sight for the

405
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,918
City Council had a lot of problems with

406
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,110
slaughters trying to get him out

407
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,720
but not much they can do as they happen

408
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,720
laws is there really were and Frank
lived are now

409
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,850

411
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,400
okay banana spinal cord I see bananas

412
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,830
from if you look all over in the corner
rights

413
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,639
on the bottom right was up to

414
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,809
for the most car as thats were post he
actually is it's not the whole squad

415
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:44,940
post is just one room and what we try to
do is

416
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,510
provide free internet access an
open-source training two people can

417
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,870
afford it

418
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,460
actually probably wanna know what puts
key means

419
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,140
just a little bit

420
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,470
can you make up some cool

421
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,309
I'm not going to

422
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:12,570
Persky actually

423
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,629
was the second squandered internet cafe
in

424
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:22,630
was modeled after asking in Amsterdam
which

425
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,780
which means absence aversive Center for
Information Interchange

426
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,960
suppose ski kinda making fun a vast ski
in a friendly way they call themselves

427
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,940
progressives

428
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,210
Utecht subversive Center for Information
Interchange

429
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,890
thats European too so we d

430
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:47,789
sweeter I

431
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,559
nice come back nice

432
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,399
I'll let me tell you about squatting in
the Netherlands

433
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,500
why this is possible there are two
general rules to squat

434
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,950
it is legal if the house has is not
being used

435
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,610
and if it has been empty for more than a
year

436
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:14,220
after that to score written just walkin
call the police and say hey we've taken

437
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,980
the building

438
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,200
and you've got that the law part on the
way

439
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,929
and all others actually after that is
all your problems have to do with the

440
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:26,559
owner of the building

441
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,980
he wants to get you out he has to our
guns in a court injunction

442
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,460
injunction to get you out our guns legal
in

443
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,530
area the world commonly held blunderbuss

444
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,750
prostitution is legal there right yeah
so here's the ferocity you out

445
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:48,820
its legal shot getting weed is legal but
not shotguns

446
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,200
what's up

447
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,809
yeah this house was on when on fire used
to be a furniture store

448
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:01,639
was called become a as you see there was
a mattress and furniture store and went

449
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,100
on fire

450
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,110
the owner didn't really care about the
building

451
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:11,770
and the roof caved in after the fire so
this city council

452
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,710
all get to that in a minute the city
council being that these two buildings

453
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,630
Armani

454
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,049
national monuments in city monuments the
City Council try to get to the owner to

455
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:22,250
fix the roof

456
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,270
and he wouldn't do it because you really
didn't care

457
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,379
saw this on a contractor in to fix the
roof

458
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,950
and they charged him for the payment in
the owner said well

459
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,039
i'd in order that's it's too expensive
and I'm not gonna pay for it

460
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,658
so the city council had a problem with
the owner for a while and this house was

461
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:41,690
a

462
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,710
anti for about two and a half years
before the squatters came in

463
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,980
and the squatters were in there for
about 10 years in

464
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,630
after that a few of them decided to make

465
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:59,580
muskie in that corner room

466
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,020
%ah

467
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,970
gonna watch what I say his is ignoring
the euphemisms

468
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,840
I know isn't it its so cutes

469
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,919
the other ones called ask you that
doesn't sound up

470
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,150
this especially yeah

471
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,549
6,000 release

472
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:24,889
yeah naturally the advantage up scoring
a house is you don't pay rent

473
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,610
the

474
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,740
so no we do this basically for nothing

475
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,010
the only costs we have our electricity
and internet

476
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,158
which we share with the rest the
squatters

477
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:48,029
to come out about 50 euros about 50
bucks a month

478
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:51,570
naturally like I said electricity cost
money and

479
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,340
we rely on donations

480
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,390
there about each core members working a
pussy and 12 in ASCII

481
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,419
and we get volunteers from all over the
world

482
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,840
our core projects are spreading idea

483
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,570
we're trying to move to other cities in
Europe

484
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:19,070
trying to offer hackerspace is where
hackers can now presents

485
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,520
anything not a hacker group

486
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,929
in the area don't have a place where
they can meet up

487
00:30:25,929 --> 00:30:30,340
and give presentations so we offer that

488
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,980
and we you

489
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,809
also thinking about offering web hosting
and web space for

490
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,070
people are not allowed to host anywhere
else

491
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,260
of political problems or

492
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:51,260
just problems with the government

493
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,580
naturally with every advance you have
disadvantages money is our biggest

494
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,620
disadvantage

495
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,490
we have some organizational problems and
we're also constantly faced with the

496
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,590
threat of eviction

497
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,720
being that it's not ours

498
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,309
max it works

499
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:19,440
past on

500
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,539
self actually we're going to introduce
at hacker halfway house

501
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:27,190
now and understand the mike over here
the

502
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,230
the group's

503
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,480
why I took all these pictures of our
place and somehow they didn't make it

504
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,960
into the slides on this guy talk for a
little bit

505
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,960
he is having our point through as
against our better judgment

506
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,440
we're having a big party at our place
tomorrow night so some you might even

507
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,669
get to see the place

508
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:49,710
because local so arm yeah

509
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:54,230
there there are few of us here arm you
know I'm pumped and far over there

510
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,870
on chin the

511
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,220
I I of currency refused and the NOC by

512
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,500
I is also here arm by Antti

513
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,669
basically have been there for about a
year where in Brooklyn were in a

514
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:12,370
fairly sketchy are an industrial part of
Brooklyn

515
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,390
Bushwick to be specific

516
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,200
and thus me we got aloft

517
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,890
and we built walls me tore down very
sketchy walls and don't know ones in

518
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,700
their place

519
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,340
the and might shut up

520
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,419
and we've been working on our project
there are benign

521
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:36,350
on work all the banners canvases and all
that you've seen around here that the

522
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,970
nine countries doing that was in our
living room

523
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:45,870
are we didn't punch the necessary for
the banners rappers are samples of the

524
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:50,220
accessed

525
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,460
I

526
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,710
mention the artist to mind giving props
she's up next

527
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,000
I'll but we needed a lot of the I
network testing and staging

528
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,370
for the network here at our place are we
had some meetings to do some testing out

529
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,960
our stuff our last party we throw these
moving parties after all the local

530
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,630
and I see 2600 needs which is probably
how most people around here no us

531
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,539
because we throw

532
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:20,070
really parts arm which will be doing
tomorrow you have the pocket

533
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,399
right I'll based

534
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,580
got about 2,000 square feet of space in
a warehouse in Brooklyn

535
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,690
arm we've got 56 people depending on how
you wanna counted

536
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,899
are paying a little bit more than these
other guys because we're in

537
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:39,020
new york city of course are but it's
pretty cheap compared to everything else

538
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,399
out here are also out in the boonies a
pro-clinton so we're not able to easily

539
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:44,890
get a t1

540
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,510
we're looking into a wireless link 55
nap megabits

541
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,980
right now we've got I 1.1 magnets ESL

542
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,980
it works pretty well we're hosting a
number of

543
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,279
projects out of our place including the
2600

544
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,440
IRC network I I ministries

545
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,169
I kill a various other things my scenes
stuff that we're hosting

546
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:10,859
stone cut yes tone KOTOR can forget
about that

547
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:16,779
I are are big advantages are that we're
very central to the big screen

548
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:19,779
there's a lot of stuff going on we've
got our own projects with that group

549
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:20,809
project

550
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,740
there's usually something going on
awesome the disadvantages are again

551
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,240
disorganization much seems to be

552
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,520
everywhere ants people like forces horse
here

553
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,779
yes if people like you like he comes in

554
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:39,809
the ends

555
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:44,260
keep eats all my food and he sleeps on a
couch and he takes up the PlayStation

556
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,869
and he just now is porous so

557
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:50,879
and hacker space as a person like that
me yes

558
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,639
so each guys

559
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,510
I think any speaking seek as we came to
him to shave agent yes

560
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,099
coach agent double oh six yes you stole
my line to

561
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:06,809
sorry I'm sorry try to coordinate
doesn't work but

562
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:11,309
basically that's actor halfway house
power throwing a party here at the hotel

563
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:14,289
later on tonight so maybe if you wanna
find on a bus

564
00:35:14,289 --> 00:35:18,549
figure out what's going on you can come
by our party see the bucket that were

565
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,450
had known for thanks to be nine punk the

566
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,529
you gotta come by and see the pockets
yet

567
00:35:25,529 --> 00:35:29,630
you'll probably remember unless you have
to like space you won't

568
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,640
arm but yes our to a party tonight and
tomorrow at our place find us

569
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,029
if you wanna come by and see the place
and see what we have going for us

570
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:40,619
otherwise oval for free to answer any
questions

571
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:47,619
thank you this airport the

572
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,279
ok create a global Cooper lives he's
hearing

573
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:56,400
binaries gonna give us our speech

574
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,789
so every you know workspace needs now is

575
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:04,220
you can go the commercial DSL line 31
but there soon have prompted that where

576
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,099
you really don't know where traffic is
going

577
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:11,109
who is looking at it so only around
that's just arianna sp

578
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:15,578
advantage that where to pay basically
also ballot cost the same amount that

579
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:16,109
the eyes

580
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:21,200
itself using you look pretty inexpensive
multi costly do is pay

581
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,240
you know the I like a a live cross year
cross-connect and then

582
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,180
your access membership for whatever
malathion buying wholesale

583
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,368
and the members responsible for their
own equipment and support you don't have

584
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:35,069
to deal with people complaining or
feline was down just

585
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:39,369
fix the problem yourself on big
advantage that use your ingress and

586
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:41,710
egress traffic they're pretty much

587
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,630
going to wear the ice keys words
bypassing you know whatever monitoring

588
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,460
system

589
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,890
whoever else is looking at the traffic
in spearing directly on

590
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:55,480
any different pairing point we decide to
call it a your access router

591
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,569
disadvantage this are your initial
startup cost is

592
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:01,680
pretty high up invest in a pretty decent
router

593
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,480
Carney the initial cross connection
setup fee for ds3 here

594
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,829
many see once on and the insulation
charge from Alliance you probably need

595
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:10,769
about

596
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:14,980
ten or fifteen people to get involved
nu-disco it to the

597
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,700
where phone company you have to say hey
I've 10 people or to place an order for

598
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,089
10 T once

599
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:24,490
for three years the give you really get
discount on

600
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,289
the disadvantages you really need to
have people that know what they're doing

601
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:32,119
to set up a t1 you really can't call
anybody ask for help you guys have to do

602
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,319
yourself

603
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:36,509
and your problem is most ilex require
three-year commitment

604
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:39,519
but if you can get all that the
advantages pretty much away the

605
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,769
disadvantages

606
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:45,539
amor use the arm Cambridge now a
consortium as an example

607
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:48,119
ours as we're currently doing in
Cambridge in this is how we have

608
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,170
collectively through his

609
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:52,940
history on the to CBC

610
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,960
provides dedicated he wants to this
number DC

611

686
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:24,650
we go through a heavy background
screening process and then

687
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,440
involves a lot of drinking use on action
at

688
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,470
you're not actually I'm serious and very
surtax you workers only one said that

they would never hire somebody could
take up drinking

698
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,640
nicking you speak to this also is a
quite way to feed again I ski started

fifteen dollars over the cost which

705
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,310
at least in boston is somewhere around a
hundred ninety dollars

706
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,520
initial thing is with their they
actually

707
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,470
the 2600 meetings is a great place to
you know meet new people and I know it

708
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,920
with the AC pace you we have

709
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,100
we have a 2600 meeting and we have
what's called a 26-21 meeting afterwards

710
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,490

711
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,010
are the people who can drink and I go to
the bar you know

broken people

714
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,790

well in a large group so I I really

715
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,890
recommend you take and some for
consideration I mean be very careful

716
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:02,670
about who you

717
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,890
we pick and choose to end it and at the
initial onset

718

721
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,730

00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,520
that population to be the right kind for
you

850
