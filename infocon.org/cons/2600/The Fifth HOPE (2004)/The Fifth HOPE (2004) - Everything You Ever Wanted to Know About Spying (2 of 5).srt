1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,220
I don't think that you really believe
that nine members the result of an

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,399
intelligence failure

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,020
I mean you're the master of the spies
what we know right now is

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,209
at the FBI and CIA had five informants
his first and last names that moment up

5
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:15,959
it was in the watches from the German 10

6
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:20,509
998 the new xx Lee that there was a
pending terrorist attack

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,450
was hiding plans at five work wardrobe
on that day the NRL postponed their own

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:25,980
drool

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,970
crushing plants to the headquarters it
was a modem driver in June tell

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,390
2001 but they look at the protest I have
all the night's top

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,510
on that hole that we can make a dollar

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,070
and you look at how I now know right now
what I want to do is to this brief

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,940
and then I will be here and I'll ask
your question at two o'clock this

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,390
morning

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:50,290
if I survive yes but a site plan a.m. us
an inside job and believe that she had

16
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:50,989
the courtesy

17
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:57,989
said yeah open crush him I will gladly
entertain

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,440
a heretical and lunatic positions later
arm

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,729
and I will tell you there's lots of ways
of looking at this

20
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:12,049
I've heard the mall I am probably the
one person that has really studied the O

21
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:12,749
sent on

22
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:16,039
on 9/11 comprehensively and Dom

23
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:19,600
and we will have the dialogue this is a
four-hour marathon session

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,779
are but first I wanna go through the
failure of twentieth-century

25
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:23,929
intelligence

26
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:27,619
alright I want you guys have a context
for having an intelligent dialogue

27
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,799
not figure in unintelligent but bear
with me

28
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,749
arm the bottom line here is that America
is an industrial

29
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:40,880
here our country we have an industrial
your educational system

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,529
we have an industrial era media system
with barron's

31
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:49,158
we have an industrial era congress are
which is completely ineffective a

32
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,569
processing information

33
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,539
are and we have an industrial era
intelligence community

34
00:01:54,539 --> 00:02:00,450
now a very quick history intelligence
the original concept for intelligence

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,989
was a secret wars

36
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:07,489
between governments okay so for
centuries that's been the primary

37
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:11,500
focus have intelligence how can we screw
and other government secretly

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,560
K then Sherman can't

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,370
after world war two and as part of the
OS s it took me three weeks to figure

40
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:18,800
out

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,750
open source solutions I had the OS but
being a Marine it took me three weeks to

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,900
figure out the third work

43
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,220
on but originally the OS s was
conceptualized as

44
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,670
a global open source intelligence
organization that would use

45
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,720
predominately academics to do strategic
intelligence

46
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,200
based on open source is things like the
price of oranges in Paris

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,470
telling you whether the railway bridges
had been bombed or not

48
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,670
okay arm and he tried that

49
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,850
hasn't been successful but it remains
valid where I think we need to go and

50
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,880
we're all these collective intelligence
guys if you google on collective

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,620
intelligence

52
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,990
you'll find everybody other than Robert
Steele on

53
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,680
there at least eight different bottom-up
self generating group I think you're

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,770
very important we need to move toward
being a smart

55
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:11,050
nation a smart nation is a nation in
which everyone on this is an

56
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,490
intelligence minuteman

57
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,020
every one of us understands the process
if intelligence we know how to apply it

58
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,200
to our work

59
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,530
whether it's art history or defending
the neighborhood

60
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,390
we know how to do this as some other
failures that we've had an intelligence

61
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,720
and

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,819
by the way I have to tell you with with
all earnestness

63
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,230
given a choice between incompetence and
conspiracy always go with incompetence

64
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,530
okay believe me it is incompetence is
vastly more likely

65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,680
are in the US government and and let me
say on a positive note this is a great

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,400
country

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,870
your smart people we can survive massive
amounts of incompetence in washington

68
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,520
arm although I am getting worried arm

69
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,330
we have basically ignored open source
information

70
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,280
I was hired by one branch to the US
government to go out and evaluate and

71
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,870
monitor terrorists insurgent opposition
web sites because they weren't satisfied

72
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,319
with the National Intelligence people
were doing

73
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,069
in less than 60 days for under sixty
thousand dollars

74
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,139
we identified and evaluated 396
terrorist insurgent opposition web sites

75
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,239
in 29 languages

76
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,259
including gaelic cuddle on a

77
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:25,240
were too far see all those normal once
the only two languages we didn't do that

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,699
we wish we had were Berber in Aramaic

79
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,650
okay I have a secret

80
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,679
I'll share it with you I don't insist
that my translators p

81
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,460
US citizens eligible for clearances who
speak the language is a shitty level

82
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,229
I go for indigenous people that speak
their own languages

83
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,199
English at a 45 level on a scale of five

84
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,529
and I use various cover mechanisms to
have them work successfully

85
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:58,909
for what they think is a European
company concerned about risk

86
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:02,990
okay this is not hard if I can do it why
can't CIA

87
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,180
now I I gotta say CIA's doing some
things right and we will have a

88
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,169
we will have a three-hour discussion but
we need OSA

89
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,650
we don't do non-official cover are

90
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,539
Jim haven't screwed this country are as
director clandestine operations

91
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,449
he and a guy named ted price

92
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,400
and several directors tenet Deutsche

93
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,520
Wolsey mediocrity is every single one

94
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,889
going back to stansfield turner who
gutted the clandestine intelligence

95
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:36,789
service

96
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:40,400
firing all of the ethnics we used to
have a clandestine service it look like

97
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,919
the United Nations

98
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,400
I mean we talkin turbine seeks the whole
nine yards and then we started going for

99
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,919
white boys from Kansas

100
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,520
are and young white boys from Kansas

101
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,308
CIA doesn't hire anyone over 35 I've
done a press release if you google for

102
00:05:55,309 --> 00:05:58,259
clandestine service and Robert Steele
you're probably seen it's got my

103
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,620
five-part solution

104
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,129
but we have been lazy and cheap you
cannot do clandestine operations from an

105
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:06,969
official installation that has local
guards that work for the local

106
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,020
counterintelligence service

107
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,339
just can't do it okay and your entry in
land if you think you can

108
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,569
arm we don't to a processing

109
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:19,550
their national imagery and mapping
agency by the way now that's called the

110
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,680
National Geospatial agency

111
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,559
nima stands for not interested in maps
anymore

112
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:29,300
okay Jim clapper has gone way over the
top line

113
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,599
digital one laptop for every five
hundred thousand people

114
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:39,050
that was what he sent to nato for bosnia
arm

115
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,719
the name a report December 1999 said
essentially we have spent trillions on

116
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:45,558
collection and nothing on processing

117
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:48,589
me process less than 10 percent over
secret images

118
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:53,369
less than 6 percent up are Russian and
Chinese signals less than three percent

119
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:57,009
over European signals less than one
percent of arrest the World Singles

120
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,249
we publicly we process roughly a million

121
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:03,809
out of several billions %uh intercepted
calls

122
00:07:03,809 --> 00:07:09,860
arm on a daily basis and by processing I
mean some form of cursory examination

123
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,150
okay the reality is that when something
like 9/11 happens we're usually about 30

124
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,349
days late and processing

125
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:21,210
arm we miss completely and our people
don't speak arabic be on the three-level

126
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,080
by and large we don't have data
standards

127
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,289
I believe in open spectrum open source
of for an open source intelligence

128
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,550
we don't have to. spatial attributes in
nineteen eighty 8

129
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,400
I told the Journal defense intelligence
program managers of which I was one for

130
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,499
the Marine Corps

131
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:44,319
I said fellas we're not gonna get to
automated all source fusion until we

132
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,110
have both a time/date stamp

133
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,309
and a teal special stamp this is not
hard to understand

134
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:53,520
but today in the 21st century

135
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,649
we are still not doing geospatial
tagging

136
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,689
have all the information we're
collecting worldwide this is just

137
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:01,809
flat-out knots

138
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:05,839
XML G on NS nasa Google on XML jheel

139
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,129
nascent particularly the nasa people at
moffett in Texas

140
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,589
are trying to get XML geo going are it's
something I support and

141
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:18,050
I would just like to see everyone
voluntarily adopt

142
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,849
a some kinda geospatial standard coding
so that any

143
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:27,430
data has codes for the point on the
earth with that it refers to you

144
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,259
we don't to all source mixing I it's
don't get me started on security

145
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,830
arm I believe in security I believe in
Smart Security I don't believe in more

146
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,110
on Dec security

147
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,760
which is what we have now on
compartmentation is the enemy of

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,420
knowledge I guarantee the next 9/11 will
happen not because we didn't know that

149
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,849
because we didn't share

150
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,000
K we're gonna know about 9/11 somewhere
in the US government and because we

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,090
didn't share

152
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,140
it's gonna happen again this is why an
essay I think needs to be the national

153
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,140
processing agency

154
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,569
an oblique trust me on this we can we
can you know one of the interesting

155
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,720
things about aggregate data mining

156
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,340
is you're doing pattern analysis and you
don't violate your privacy until you're

157
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,160
known to be in contact with the
terrorist

158
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,300
okay I mean aggregate data mining is a
cool idea

159
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,640
and pattern analysis is actually the
heart of signals intelligence

160
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,770
not reading the content okay

161
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,370
its pattern analysis and you don't
violate individual privacy and to you

162
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,090
have a

163
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,200
really rock-solid picture that says this
guy is making repeated phone calls to a

164
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,210
known terrorist safe house

165
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,960
K so I i support privacy I don't support
the Patriot Act

166
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,420
I support privacy are and I support
smart intelligence and I think we have

167
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,479
to be serious about this

168
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,100
arm one of the main problems we make an
analysis is we try and put expertise

169
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,060
foreign languages and security
clearances all in the same person

170
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,860
by and large that's almost mission
impossible

171
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,610
all we're focused on threats and save
opportunities

172
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,010
we have been focused on creating a
military designed to be russia and China

173
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,200
and stayed on state war we have spent
almost nothing on the other three threat

174
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,760
classes and we've spent almost nothing
on stabilizing the world

175
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,410
Ambassador Mark palmer's written a book
called The the other axis of evil

176
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,100
about the forty-four dictators survive
saddam hussein

177
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,500
there are 44 dictators in the world
dictator's by definition create failed

178
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,650
states

179
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,480
ambassador Palmer recommends a new Under
Secretary of State for

180
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,820
four ROM democracy and you have to
assist the secretaries one for the guys

181
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,720
that agree to leverage buyout

182
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,660
one for the guys the dull K

183
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,079
I think most of them will agree to
leverage buyout

184
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,420
arm and then over the pentagon I want to
have an undersecretary for peacekeeping

185
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,459
are and humanitarian assistance and I
want to use the military machine to

186
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,690
start delivering medicine and food and
water

187
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,870
we don't do preventive investments okay

188
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,280
arm our emphasis is on the local in the
current vice the global the future I

189
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,350
love Stewart brands book the clock along
now

190
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:16,060
it took me five years to read it because
I really thought it was about a clock

191
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,930
but now I understand it's about teaching
all this to adopt with the Native

192
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,590
Americans call seventh generation
thinking

193
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:28,210
how does our decision today impact seven
generations out

194
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,020
that's what we should be thinking about
if we want our children and our

195
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,140
grandchildren have the quality of life

196
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,060
that we have today and it's getting
worse by the day

197
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,600
we have to teach our politicians
politicians are getting away with murder

198
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
today because we're not holding them
accountable

199
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,760
they're basically spending three
quarters their time with their hand out

200
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,720
okay

201
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,770
I see you guys as part an army of
volunteers

202
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:03,100
that makes it impossible for John chains
six pack to sleep at night

203
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,350
they have to pay attention are I'm about
to start a nonprofit in stock common

204
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,500
we're going to try and recruit

205
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,960
retired intelligence officers from all
seven tribes around the world

206
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,160
to serve as volunteers to take an
education package

207
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,199
into every school house every Chamber of
Commerce meeting every social club every

208
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,450
labor union

209
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,460
to basically say folks we have to pay
attention I know I'm preaching to the

210
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,480
choir here but

211
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,640
but this is really serious if we don't
pay attention we are going to be screwed

212
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,960
arm we fail to impact on the national
budget

213
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,880
National Intelligence has absolutely
nothing to do with what the US

214
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,580
government spends its money on

215
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,460
because our senators and congressmen are
being bought off

216
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,720
in fact I just posted something on on
assessed and then a couple months ago

217
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,950
medical journals can no longer be
trusted by the doctors

218
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,190
because just about every medical article
is written by someone funded

219
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,430
by the drug company whose drugs he's
talking about

220
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:06,430
okay I mean we have lost our integrity
across-the-board

221
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,410
so I have a simple reform I think I
think

222
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,680
companies have to pay taxes on what they
tell their stockholders they made a

223
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,050
profit on and we do have to have global
campaign finance reform

224
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,340
we have to end gerrymandering we should
have basically virtual constituencies

225
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,760
you you select whatever party wanna be
of

226
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,110
and then that entire state everyone
who's a libertarian gets to vote for the

227
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,110
libertarian no matter where they live

228
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,950
okay arm and there are other reforms i5
posted something on my website call

229
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,600
citizen in search of a leader

230
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,800
on and a lot of these ideas are ralph
nader's although he doesn't play well

231
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,760
with others

232
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,360
on and I really would like to see I
don't think carries gonna win

233
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,760
I think if Carrie wants to win he has to
use the democratic convention as I said

234
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,620
yesterday

235
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,900
so many have you were not or not here
that all or repeat this week I think

236
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,170
it's important

237
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,420
if anyone knows John carrier John
Edwards

238
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,290
please tell them they're not going to
win unless they use the democratic

239
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,969
convention to announce

240
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,300
a national convention of all parties
including my republicans will come up

241
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,800
with a unity plank

242
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,170
and a unity cabinet that will be
announced in advance the general

243
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,500
election

244
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,620
and John Carey I've I've told his staff

245
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,340
they don't listen but they've certainly
heard from in more ways than one I've

246
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,100
said

247
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,780
you can't beat the republican dog with
the democratic taught you can only be

248
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,390
done if your dog catcher

249
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,730
and the dog catcher issue in this
election is restoring the vote to the

250
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,000
individual

251
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,360
okay we don't have that today half
america's disenfranchised

252
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,750
and a quarter of it is not paying
attention arm

253
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,360
policy failures we fail to impact on
policy makers are policymakers are

254
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,720
loosely educated

255
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,950
they have got to where they are but
being schmooze urs not by being smart

256
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,790
arm until 9/11 we have senators and
congressmen bragging that they did not

257
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,640
have a US passport

258
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,510
because nothing that happened overseas
matter to their constituents

259
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,390
okay now after 9/11 a lot of them still
don't have a passport and you should ask

260
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,770
every single one your Congressmen and
Senators do you have a passport

261
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,970
do you study Foreign Affairs do you
understand the intelligence failures

262
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:21,140
we have to educate them we fail to win
public support for intelligence

263
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,250
bill clinton let intelligence and
defense

264
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,350
are run to pot no pun intended arm

265
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,310
because he was small Obama draft-dodging
pot-smoking issues

266
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,790
and so he bill he had secretary cohen
who is an enormous mediocrity

267
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,459
arm to basically be part of the military
industrial complex and then run the

268
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,090
pentagon into the ground

269
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:48,270
arm we have to understand that national
intelligence is not about spies in

270
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,240
secrecy

271
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,400
it's about knowing it's about
understanding

272
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,550
to that spending our money properly it's
about behaving properly

273
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,050
been line could not have asked for a
final result

274
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,290
out of 9/11 than the invasion of Iraq

275
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:10,290
it brought the far enemy near

276
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,349
we feel to impact on what we buy when I
stopped touring quite talented center

277
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,160
the first thing I ordered was a study

278
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,079
first I had to get the record agree on
what 69 countries

279
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,080
are we thought were important I had no
particular intent when I

280
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,170
selected 69 but a general felt
uncomfortable with that we said ok 867

281
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,810
countries into island group

282
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:35,470
arm a

283
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,060
he was a very prudish general arm

284
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,610
but I said I want to study to be
unclassifiable unclassified in findings

285
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,279
one of the things we discovered was that
the Navy in the air force a building

286
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,040
aircraft to standard aviation day that
is warm and not humid

287
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,640
sixty-five degrees and humid it turns
out that the real world aviation day is

288
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,380
eighty degrees and human more often than
not and in six very important countries

289
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,890
including Afghanistan

290
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,980
it's over 6,000 feet elevation which
means that all these airplanes can carry

291
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,220
half as much half as far as they can
only later over the battlefield for five

292
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,760
minutes at a time this is not cool

293
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,050
okay cross-country mobility

294
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,530
we can't move and seventy-nine percent
of our country's

295
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,849
other than on the the roads and bridges
that are in place and oh by the way

296
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,550
what were busy building ninety
seven-time artillery systems and

297
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,569
70 ton tanks it turns out nobody sells a
truck that weighs more than thirty tons

298
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,490
to anyone in the third world why

299
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,370
is the bridges can carry them this is
what my 14-year-old call

300
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,700
a clue okay

301
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,160
we should not be building things that
way more than thirty to forty tons

302
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,400
are line of sight distances we spent
incredible amounts of money

303
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,430
being able to head in at Sasa 3,000
meters

304
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,170
well it turns out that has to be
carrying animator

305
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:59,030
trust him I plate it also turns out most
to the world is under 900 meters in its

306
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,120
covered by jungle canopy

307
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,520
or turbine or its mountainous only
one-quarter six countries

308
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,730
above the cases we looked at were
actually fare fortunately for us in the

309
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,380
gulf war

310
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,610
they were all there arm but by and large
in most the world you need to be able to

311
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,380
kill things

312
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,140
at under 900 meters under canopy and the
satellites can't help you

313
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,020
K arm I satellites can find a great for
but you have to tell murderous

314
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,680
K that's why we couldn't find the scuds
arm

315
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,770
ports airheads it turns out we can
deliver in fifty percent of the ports

316
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,160
it's too shallow there's no turning
radius there's no peer side

317
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,170
so we have to go to their heads while
the air force's build busy building

318
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,120
these long-range transport so it won't
fit on most airports

319
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,750
K the C 130 is still the most viable
delivery system for most to the world

320
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,200
arm and then see for anti internet open

321
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,760
I believe that nato in the partners for
peace cannot afford american

322
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,309
nato DOD standard communications are

323
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,379
you know I mean we're going into places
where we end up having to spend special

324
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,730
forces teams

325
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,970
with all over secret radios that doesn't
work we have to elevate the security of

326
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,720
the Internet to the point where anyone
Inc

327
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,809
anybody can play and we can create come
as you are coalitions

328
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,980
and then all TWS at some just back from
teaching at fort bragg

329
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,770
and one of the things we discussed as we
desperately need a division

330
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,129
a military police we need a division of
Civil Affairs

331
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,059
officers we need a division of open
source intelligence

332
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,080
public affairs liaison officers

333
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,919
aren't we are just investing in the
wrong things

334
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,750
we have been impacted I used to pay
sister and a thousand dollars a month to

335
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,410
translate my website

336
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,390
but the Austrians in particular
complained about the German

337
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,390
are the French of course complain about
everything

338
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,110
on are and so I stopped and it turns out
looking into it the reason that system

339
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,730
wasn't working was because Bill Gates
keeps migrating mutating his application

340
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,720
program interfaces

341
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,870
Microsoft should not be a lawsuit it
should be a standard should be a law

342
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,580
any software program will publish
application program interfaces in the

343
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,919
handshake will be stable for three years

344
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,160
K this is real simple I wasn't my idea
was John mccartney's the father VI

345
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,860
we had the other hackers group then I'm
a member of a silicon valley hackers

346
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,400
also the guys with the money

347
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,300
arm John Gilmore amply number five Sun

348
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,330
are Phil Zimmerman

349
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,320
Stewart Brand plant any guys like that
and I try to go out there every two or

350
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,939
three years

351
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,990
speakers that's where I get energized in
another way

352
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,309
we haven't defined an agile security
architecture

353
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,580
we failed to define generic
functionalities the bottom line is

354
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,330
there's no analytic tool kit that we can
all share

355
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,490
there should be this slide is called the
catalysts light if you google for

356
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,260
catalyst

357
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,370
you should find a computer it's also the
house is a mess and T

358
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,720
we knew it CIA in 1986

359
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,179
that we needed 18 functionalities on a
desktop including

360
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:06,730
modeling and simulation structured
argument arm

361
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,220
anomaly detection all this stuff all
these data conversion things

362
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,020
and guess what in 1988

363
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:21,790
CIA made a decision that it would
standardize on the IBM ps/2

364
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,000
the dumbest terminal on the face of the
earth

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,820
and the reason see I made this decision
putting aside all the stuff that we

366
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,629
experts are saying about object-oriented
programming and

367
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,620
analytic tools and stuff they said yeah
but it's easy to have good security

368
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,620
with the IBM ps/2 if you wanna be a
moron and have good security this is the

369
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,160
perfect choice

370
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,429
okay as a CIA had a lobotomy in 1988

371
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,960
are we fail to provide for intelligence
all the systems that we're building in

372
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,890
todo all this homeland security stuff
there's no money for the data

373
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:58,300
there's no money for the
interoperability among agencies I

374
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,520
Homeland Security is a monstrous
deception on the public

375
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,050
arm intelligence is being treated as a
free good it doesn't exist

376
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,169
our commanders are still something that
they'll get what they need but in fact

377
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,740
no one's be held accountable for not
knowing and not being able to get it

378
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,920
we can't do wide area surveillance we
still can't process we're so busy

379
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,290
building all these UAB's

380
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:24,500
but the issue a visa by looking at the
battlefield with a straw

381
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,970
and there's no technology yet practical
for taking 15 UAB's

382
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:33,470
and bring it all together and to
consolidate a picture which by the way

383
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,210
is what I also want to be able to do
with your cell phones

384
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,480
so if there's another sniper thing I
want an alert and everybody with the

385
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,410
cell phone just sticks up

386
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,480
points at random and beans it back to a
Scotty and bone we have a

387
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,660
360 a of that picture team completely
voluntary

388
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,870
arm we can't do real time change
detection

389
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,320
it's just terrible arm we can to the
last mile

390
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,659
we can see under jungle can appear in
the city streets we can find single

391
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,590
individuals

392
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,370
it's a great book on the hunt for pablo
escobar but look at noriega in panama

393
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,140
we already had 12,000 troops one of the
largest CIA stations in Latin America

394
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,110
and Panama

395
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,570
and we had to invade the country to get
one guy

396
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,360
thats incompetence that should have been
a special ops team with silencers and

397
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,820
good CIA intelligence

398
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,919
if and by the way noriega had been told
he had to get out of jail free card from

399
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,340
the white house

400
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,809
the white house in bill casey told no
Diego you let us support the country's

401
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:35,420
from panama you could do all the drugs
you want

402
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,679
just like brzezinski told Pakistan that
they could have the bomb as long as they

403
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,679
supported the war in Afghanistan

404
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,549
are against the Soviets okay we're
cutting deals out at the white house

405
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,600
that are in complete violation of US law
arm

406
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,860
and this is a nonpartisan I'm not bash
in any particular party it's the nature

407
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,170
of the beast

408
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,470
the US Air Force now requires 24 hours

409
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,030
in order to change bombing package

410
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,970
in my day you had Civil Air Patrol's a
good hit anything

411
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:13,460
24 hours all it's down to twenty four
hours okay well depending on the mission

412
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,480
but in general clark spoken and several
other books

413
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,420
they're saying you have to give us 24
hours notice

414
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,490
all please don't get technical with me
but the point is it's a problem

415
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,309
okay I want people in five minutes
Tripler I want mix packages ready to go

416
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,830
I want stuff deliverable within one to
two hours just like I wanna put on a

417
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,100
Marine's anywhere in the world within 24
hours we can talk about that later

418
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,010
arm philosophical failure

419
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,879
we've confuse secrecy with intelligence

420
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,290
we failed to create a generic
intelligence disappoint and we fail to

421
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:48,678
develop

422
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,080
regional or global intelligence networks
congressman Simmons

423
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,309
is now personally taking an interest in
open source intelligence and we're

424
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:59,750
trying very hard to get 125 million and
give your money

425
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,059
for a a a program it's in my

426
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,649
it's in meiosis page basically I want to
put $10 million dollar

427
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,030
open source intelligence collection
facilities in each of the theaters

428
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,470
including NORTHCOM

429
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,240
and I want them to be multinational
wanna data warehouse for sharing with

430
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,070
NGOs

431
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,590
I won a digital History Center for
cutting the spines of Chinese islamic

432
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,290
another publications in creating the
digital history

433
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,100
are and so on so forth

434
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,299
at a some the only thing is going to
protect us against terrorism and other

435
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,220
ills

436
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,640
is public sharing now I don't know how
come I understand this in the US

437
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,720
government doesn't

438
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,490
arm I think you do are the bottom line
is the new paradigm reward sharing more

439
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,270
than every word secrecy

440
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,129
secrecy is an outdated pathological
concept urban books written about this

441
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,370
Voltaire's bastards arm

442
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,200
ellsberg's new book is actually quite
good on secrets a memoir

443
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,450
and my review ellsberg's book will help
you are

444
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,890
basically secrecy is pathological arm

445
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,160
can have smart spies in a domination

446
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,450
I think the rest of the world is made a
serious mistake in letting Americans

447
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,920
lead

448
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,900
the the whole global secret intelligence
process

449
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,990
I am doing what I can to nurture the the
the people who are thinking about a

450
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,990
European intelligence network

451
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,770
and one of the first things I told him
was don't try and create a Central

452
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,950
Intelligence Agency for europe

453
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,660
in the aged distributed information
central intelligence is an oxymoron

454
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,720
okay you need to have a network approach

455
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,990
conclusions spies only no secrets
intelligence is about discovering

456
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,760
discriminating distilling delivering

457
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,860
answers and I did my second thesis I
looked at every embassy came to the

458
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,140
content three embassies right served

459
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,520
on and came to the conclusion that we
were collecting roughly 10 percent

460
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,190
up what could be known that was relevant
to your interests but then in sending it

461
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,440
back by hard copy

462
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,110
pouched Washington we were speaking
eighty percent

463
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:04,590
which is where my informed gas comes
from the washington is operating on two

464
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,910
percent

465
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,910
all the relevant international national
security information

466
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,540
my former partner Mark loan follows the
ATC I for analysis and production

467
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,950
today are are within the intelligence
community

468
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,620
when he was staff director the house
permanent Select Committee for

469
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,540
intelligence

470
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,200
he is to try and tell the contest the
service you don't get points for

471
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,880
collecting information on the hardest

472
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,070
or most expensive way possible but
that's precisely what we keep doing

473
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,659
because it benefits the corporation
building at any benefits a congressman

474
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,419
your average congressmen or senators
getting a 2.5 to 5 percent pay off

475
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,600
from every contract it goes into their
state

476
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,410
K that's the standard we need to make it
so that we double their salaries

477
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,110
and we cut off her hands if they take
money from corporations

478
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,820
arm and last but not least I was a
consultant to an intelligence community

479
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,740
project was trying to think about asking

480
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,990
I said wait a minute you say the only
thing you're trying to ask is

481
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:09,309
is which the secret and should you task

482
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:13,668
and they said yeah should their three
other questions you should ask first

483
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:16,750
first question should ask is do we
already know this

484
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,910
and can we find it and the answer's no
we can't find it we don't know if we

485
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,679
know this

486
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,390
it's too hard so we get it again the
second question we should be asking is

487
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,669
if we don't already know this can we get
it from someone else

488
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:34,820
from another ally from from another
member of the seven tribes whatever

489
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,200
if we can't find it and weak can't get
it for free

490
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,600
can we buy it from the private sector to
price we can afford a reasonable price

491
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,360
then time in security constraints and so
on and only if you can't find it get it

492
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,200
or buy it

493
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,040
should you steal it the US intelligence
community has not matured to this point

494
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,678
your

495
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,630
makes answer add value one of the things
that the National Intelligence

496
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,320
communities being told today by the
Special Operations Command

497
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,399
is that nothing they're producing is
useful

498
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,320
when I was a battalion landing team
match in a very privileged position for

499
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,409
for young second lieutenant because
among other things it meant that when

500
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:12,870
you went

501
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,679
on Snavely ship you have what's called
comics box

502
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,000
for your sakes and it was always room
for cases a beer

503
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,770
that the navy couldn't find because it
was classified are

504
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:30,110
okay a I was definitely the most
powerful second lieutenant in Asia

505
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,660
arm for a brief time

506
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,140
what SOCOM Assange is don't bother
sending us finish production we need the

507
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,580
raw data

508
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,678
and so where I think we're gonna end up
is with the distributed network

509
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:47,470
that collects on demand processes on
demand and produces on demand

510
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,850
and finished broadcast production is
history

511
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,390
by and large arm it's about actual
answers

512
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:59,049
not secrets not spies not toys and I
really do truly believe in the proven

513
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,730
crafted intelligence

514
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,730
I think you have some intelligence
professionals you can be proud of you

515
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,250
also have some that should be

516
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,700
at a minimum covered with honey and
kneel down over an amp it

517
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,950
arm art now that's the end of the brief

518
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,970
its 11 its 1115 let's say

519
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,179
what I want to do is take a ten-minute
break

520
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:23,120
we're gonna do the Pens up here again
let's take a fifteen-minute break we'll

521
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,470
do the Pens again

522
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,270
and at 11:30 are I will start to any
questions and answers

523
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,490
are and basically Laslo get the big
Samoan guy

524
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,520
on and what we're gonna do is we're
going to ask simple questions

525
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,000
that are very brief and you only get one
question

526
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,010
arm and then we'll do as much
interaction as you want house

527
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,580
all stay in this room as long as they're
100 people here which I think we've got

528
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,449
right now

529
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:56,450
okay so fifty-minute breaking will do
pens up here

530
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:05,520
this yes

531
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:22,770
area actually

532
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
but go ahead sir

533
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,150
data integrity

534
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:45,830
in a distributed environment by
encrypting at what if it started

535
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,080
%ah then you hunt down and kill the
person that put it up in the first place

536
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,980
I am a take you know at at the other
hackers conference about ten years ago

537
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,059
we had an actual discussion about

538
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:02,549
a personal templates and personal
reputations

539
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:07,190
and it's really interesting because a
pre- ceded this whole blogging thing

540
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,290
by the way all of my lectures are
available on my website

541
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,620
don't try it with the modem are

542
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,929
but if you have a high speed line you
can easily download and I have lectures

543
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:17,260
that

544
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,950
review the literature our selection
emerging threats literature on strategy

545
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,059
and ball back in all this stuff it's a
really fine Student Resource

546
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,330
arm but basically I think

547
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,620
that templates and your personal
reputation is going to be much more

548
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,620
valuable

549
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,320
arm as a source for ad hoc

550
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,860
are enquiries in hiring and and cash in

551
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,679
and so forth and I think over time just
like Amazon and

552
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:47,919
e-bay our people are going to get raided

553
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,160
and the people doing the rated rating
are going to get

554
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,419
rated and so if you have more on
constantly giving you a one eventually

555
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:55,770
he wipes himself out

556
00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:01,639
okay arm but I think our personal
reputation and tagging all data with who

557
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,610
collected it

558
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:06,360
is going to eventually help create this
citizen

559
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,130
world brain of concept I think data
absolutely must have actually Butte's

560
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,679
about everyone who has touched it the
chain of custody if you will

561
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,770
arm yeah like we used to do an evidence
one

562
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,780
when I was shaken down my Marines for
drugs you know when I found drugs in

563
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,639
their socks I had actually have a

564
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,570
a receipt for every person that touch
that all the way up to the courtroom

565
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,450
are and so I think information is gonna
need to have a chain of custody

566
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,570
and and biases and attributes and all
that in this day in age that's that's a

567
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,678
simple thing to do yes sir have a look
at our that deal with the Metadata

568
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:41,580
Repository

569
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,409
Sat XML that deal do it allows us to
talk

570
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:49,549
geospatial for nations to but I don't
think all the attributes like dat

571
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:50,559
integrity here and there

572
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,110
give any comment arm pasta house

573
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,880
who was a director defense information
as a friend of mine and he tried hard

574
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,890
he came up with this concept of
corporate information management and I

575
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,140
extended it to global information
management

576
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,500
the bottom line is a DOT is over 2,000
fiefdoms none of which give a shit about

577
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,510
any the others

578
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:14,659
arm and I'm sure there are wonderful
efforts across DOD that I'm not familiar

579
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,409
with

580
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,070
and that sounds like something I'd love
to get an email on on

581
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,340
but the bottom line for me

582
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,220
is I think we need an internet standards
process for date I don't think mister is

583
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:26,830
working

584
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:30,850
as best I can tell you have a follow-up

585
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,330
rather building DOD Metadata Repository
now

586
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,659
they're getting the standard together
templates document type definitions

587
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,179
but solid are they asking for public
comment I'm so yes

588
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:48,080
well that's good that's that's progress
arm any other questions

589
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,899
okay quick spy story there I was in a
McDonald's in the Central American

590
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,740
country wearing my goatee and in the
tropical heat it started to come off

591
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,820
so I finish the rest the meeting like
this next

592
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,630
yeah I have a question if we're going to
be collecting this data for you

593
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,000
not collecting for me you're cooking for
yourself but go ahead so how are we

594
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,420
gonna be given access to the data where
are we going

595
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,310
I don't have all the solutions but I
think

596
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:22,470
that we have failed to harness the
volunteer manpower

597
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,420
and we have also failed to get to micro
cash to the point where it's effective

598
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,970
arm I would like to get to micro cash
I'd like to get to eat copyright I'd

599
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,619
like to get to audit trails

600
00:35:32,619 --> 00:35:36,790
and these are all things way beyond my
technical competence

601
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:40,660
arm my IT guy is Steve Arnold

602
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,770
now from Arnold information technologies
in Kentucky

603
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:48,609
on and we talked Inc you tell and others

604
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:54,529
arm basically I think we need to restore
the idea of an Information Commons in

605
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,960
the internet begins that process

606
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,160
but the real data is the data that is in
protected databases

607
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,589
and one of the reasons that I want to
increase security on the Internet

608
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:09,589
is because I want to increase the
prospects for sharing stuff

609
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:13,020
are with more and more people yes sir

610
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,920
in terms of how are you gonna get or how
do you propose people actually

611
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,310
use the data not use the data by kinda
that called for reform is that lead by

612
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,230
example

613
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,369
is to show people hey this is what you
can get over here

614
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:30,230
as opposed to right now you've got like
you said the 2005 times

615
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,440
what's their incentive to go with this
other program

616
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,530
that they can do their job better that's
a big part of it I i just pay two

617
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,150
thousand five hundred dollars for a CEO
sales course

618
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,380
CEO all are selling to Cpl and it's
interesting because

619
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,230
because my whole life I've been trying
to explain things to people in a

620
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,630
rational way

621
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,050
and and they made it crystal clear to me
look if it ain't about sex for profit or

622
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,100
power they're not gonna listen

623
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,650
are and don't try and sell 'em anything
asked what their problem is in and solve

624
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,430
it

625
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,000
are and then explain to them that the
reason you cost three times as much as

626
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,350
because they're not adding up the hidden
costs of doing it with the other guy

627
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,900
arm that's in a nutshell night us to pay
the 1500

628
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,970
other piglet I i realize

629
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:18,300
we really haven't done a good job of
holding people accountable for being

630
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,440
stupid

631
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,130
arm and my 14-year-old hates the Fairfax
County

632
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,359
school system which is a pretty good
school system

633
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:33,240
up but he got an F in biology and his
excuse was an acceptable want to me says

634
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,030
dad i was bored the last quarter she
just showed videos

635
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,260
I can understand that I'd be not only
board

636
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,300
test I mean he got an A the corner that
they were doing lab work

637
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,680
are this is a kid that spent nine hours
waiting to catch a fish

638
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,270
okay I have no doubts about his
intelligence his perseverance I do have

639
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,330
doubts about

640
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:58,220
you know the teachers kind of getting
lazy ants using videos as a substitute

641
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,540
for being teachers

642
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:03,170
arm and sold I don't have all the
answers

643
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,369
but I think google has come a long way

644
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,600
the Internet has come a long way I don't
like Google Answers

645
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,680
I think Google is sitting on an 8
billion-dollar-a-year pot of gold

646
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,240
and they are so hung up on their god
damn algorithms that they're not willing

647
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,300
to do commercial intelligence

648
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,330
our pic is if you take the bell curve
for the people that use Google

649
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:29,150
put me on one and I spent $5000 a ten
thousand dollars you're buying books and

650
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,520
things on the internet

651
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,330
arm but that doesn't count the two or
three hundred thousand ice

652
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,770
I pay for consultants and things like
that are but II as an individual five

653
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,650
thousand bucks

654
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,730
and then at the bottom put 0 the median
point maybe is

655
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,910
five hundred dollars Google is sitting
on 8

656
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,750
billion dollars a year in onto me and
information sales and I don't think

657
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,950
Google Answers is the way to go

658
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,100
arm so do you have any other comment I

659
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,350
so you're proposing more about your
thinking at least a long line to the top

660
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:03,310
down hold accountable now to propagate
down to the organization versus

661
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:07,279
I think it's a pole system it's not a
push system and it's a system

662
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,470
in which the poll is

663
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,810
is accompanied by accountability audit
and

664
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,960
actor Butte some every person that such
that data

665
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,040
are so that you know whose touch that
data and actually you can even convene

666
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,100
a meeting about that data you know with
one button

667
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,410
you hit every person is touched it and
you give them a financial or sexual

668
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,279
incentive

669
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,280
for having a conversation okay next
person

670
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,670
slowly yes so you talked about

671
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:39,109
how education contributes to this I'm as
one people wearing

672
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:42,359
the academic button on how

673
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,450
what is a basic tool kit in your opinion
for educating citizens for society

674
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,550
that will help make intelligence you
know

675
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,690
for everyone possible just either kids
no on after adults like the litigation

676
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,660
as well as challenge

677
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,810
we someone smarter than me said that we
spent two hundred years perfecting the

678
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,680
school system that creates factory
workers

679
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,370
arm I think that's right all we're not
teaching kids how to learn

680
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,819
were basically paying for very expensive
childcare

681
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:14,450
arm and we're doing in eighteen years
would probably be done in five

682
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,440
arm if we really went at it in a more
intelligent way

683
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,630
I personally believe that we should move
to a new

684
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:26,670
a tree adsystem: in which people spend
one-third of their time

685
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,800
studying one-third of their time
traveling or an internship sir community

686
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,550
service and one-third of their time

687
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,140
working every year love their life

688
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:42,170
okay are we are completely out of touch
with what we need

689
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,819
I can ask followup on a really basic
level on just for

690
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,640
at the point of dealing with the
information what kinds of things do

691
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,850
people need to know

692
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:57,440
the reason that I'm creating this
nonprofit in stock on because I I think

693
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,640
the Swedes have replaced the Canadians

694
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,779
as the trusted third-party and we're
creating it with nine languages its

695
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,700
golden candle society in nine different
languages

696
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,220
I need to buy the domain names next week
so please don't beat me to it

697
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,980
on but Tom

698
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,940
what I want to do is recruit retired
intelligence professionals from all

699
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,609
seven tribes

700
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:23,670
and I want to create a standard
educational package on the proven

701
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,500
process intelligence

702
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:30,100
arm the proven process intelligence is
significantly different from academic

703
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,810
research in

704
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,060
in some ways arm

705
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,170
generally anything that is broadcaster
is published for general distribution is

706
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,280
research

707
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,180
intelligence is about answering an
important question for someone specific

708
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,200
was gonna take an action or do something
that that actually

709
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,740
makes a financial or sexual difference
in their lives get these guys really

710
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,359
drove it home to me here

711
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,589
I am arm

712
00:41:57,589 --> 00:42:01,770
and sell for example I had a general I
had a I had a a two-star general send a

713
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,480
one-star general

714
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,609
an email I said tell me everything about
mining US harbors

715
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,920
and so this one star Sinitta karnal send
it to me and we spent three thousand

716
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,140
dollars in form and Ace

717
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,299
figuring out all the ways that that
ports could be mined here mines

718
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,339
landmine sea mines sent back to to
stress that this is what I wanted

719
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:26,450
what I wanted to know was how could a US
militant close a US port

720
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,020
it's completely different question and
because the one star didn't have the

721
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,370
balls to ask the two star sir why do you
wanna know in what context and so forth

722
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,450
we wasted three thousand dollars in form
and Ace

723
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:42,630
are getting the question right is very
important requirements and else

724
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:46,040
requirements definition you really have
to understand what it is you wanna known

725
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,770
why

726
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:51,200
and when and how long the answer should
be and just how much money you want to

727
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,670
spend you wanna five-dollar answered you
want a five thousand dollar answer

728
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,670
requirements definition that collection
management knowing who knows

729
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:03,670
I am appalled at the number of people
that don't understand citation analysis

730
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,640
using the Social Science Citation Index
or the Science Citation Index both

731
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,520
published by the Institute for
Scientific Information

732
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:14,300
created by Eugene Garfield one of
america's most brilliant people

733
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:19,339
are I can find out for a thousand
dollars $500 bucks in a dialogue ranking

734
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:22,759
command and 500 bucks an analyst time I
can find out who the top 100 people the

735
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,339
world are

736
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:27,990
on anything I have to do a study on
left-handed lithuanians with your wax

737
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,900
problems I can find the top 10 guys

738
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,240
a or gals or in betweens are

739
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,839
on that and I call up night I decide

740
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,549
or my client decides what citizenship
searched up the ball and I call up

741
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,890
top guy in a San Juan City check for
$2000 I saw no one's ever called me and

742
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,250
said that before I said well here's what
I want to do

743
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,400
and I don't want to take more than four
to six hours your time and oh by the way

744
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,950
I want the answer within 3 working days

745
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,310
and they do an IQ are and so

746
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:01,060
there's very few people I can't hire
overnight on a phone call

747
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,940
are and I don't bother hiring just
anybody I only hire

748
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,119
people who are in the top 10 to 100 I

749
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,850
in there selected field and oh by the
way they know the 100 the don't publish

750
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,779
who were in government or elsewhere and
then source discovery and validation I

751
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,980
mean I think source discover in
validation is extremely important we're

752
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,640
not paying enough attention to it

753
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,350
are most of what is available on the
Internet most of what is available from

754
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,470
commercial media

755
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:32,619
is crap arm we now talk about blue 0
cent and black 0 set

756
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:36,770
blue 0 sent is new knowledge created on
the fly

757
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:41,380
using legal and ethical methods
including ground walkers and and

758
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,880
four dollar day PHD's and and stuff like
that are we'll actually go and do

759
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,080
interviews take pictures do whatever we
will create knowledge that is not

760
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,650
available in box

761
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,740
or newspapers or magazines or
dissertations

762
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,690
black ohs it is so sad that so good I
don't want you to know I can do it

763
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:02,940
are because the sources will dry up just
this just as they dry up with secret

764
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,670
sources and methods are blown

765
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:08,950
on and we're doing black ocean now arm

766
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:13,430
so I think what people need to know is
that there is a process intelligence

767
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:17,669
that there is a discipline and patience
and methodology of learning and

768
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:21,290
and research and intelligence arm

769
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:24,560
and that if you wanna play video games
all your life that's fine

770
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,830
but you're gonna go hungry

771
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:31,660
you know and I'm having this discussion
my 14-year-old it's driving me crazy

772
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,730
I mean he really thinks he can make it
as a hamburger

773
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,040
flipper at mcdonnell's

774
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,279
nerve then it's your question okay

775
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,319
next sir hi I'm

776
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,350
just you talking about standards before
and I get some others people that's

777
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,520
the other people that really excited
about the idea of collective

778
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,520
intelligence

779
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,680
and I believe this standards that the
ODIs been working on called the AM L and

780
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,618
oil

781
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:59,869
which are both based on double the year
for

782
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:03,170
allowing information be found sheared
and

783
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,130
more easily classified and perhaps he
couldn't stand DBMS

784
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,500
and the stand on my tiptoes topic maps
and wonder if you heard about that

785
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,560
a pre-show summers technologies could be
%uh views well I would love to I would

786
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,190
love to see a dialog emerge and that I'd
certainly welcome an email it you can

787
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,190
get my card or send an email to bare it
all assessed on that

788
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,830
I mean I Arnold handles a technical
questions and and other people handle

789
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,299
the technical questions

790
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,690
arm sold don't look to me is

791
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,690
as being intelligent about standards or
anything like that

792
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,980
but I think the discussion needs to be
held vents earth

793
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,670
I think did a tremendous job setting a
voluntary rapid

794
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,890
internet standards process are there are
also people like Robert Harmon who ran

795
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:48,520
and see the american National Standards
Institute who hate standards

796
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,210
are they think standards are the enemy
of progress arm

797
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:56,390
I personally think better is the enemy
of good enough

798
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:00,299
and I think proprietary is the enemy of
progress arm

799
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,330
and so we need to have standards that
are good enough

800
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:08,020
for sharing I mean one of the things
I've stopped doing is

801
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,000
it really pisses me off the US
government client requires the use

802
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,130
Microsoft

803
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:16,490
on and so I've started posting as much
as I can in RTF

804
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,609
are just because it makes me angry that

805
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:24,359
dock and PPT are translatable in my
grade a bull and all these other things

806
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:28,339
in can i sorry and thank you to everyone
alright

807
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:31,670
um others you know ask is my last
question so it's good that you just said

808
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:32,109
that

809
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:35,210
is much my last question earlier on you
said that you know

810
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,619
given the choice between incompetence
and conspiracy always choose

811
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:39,619
incompetence

812
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:43,050
now in 999 there was a b1

813
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:46,220
Obama blue flew over from the state's to

814
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,240
Kosovo and dropped to b1 bombs

815
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,760
on the Chinese embassy in the middle of
the Kosovo War

816
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,970
and afterwards they said well we had the
wrong man we working from a tourist map

817
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,520
from 9-10

818
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,030
do you honestly believe that well I've
heard two competing stories they're both

819
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,290
believable but the

820
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:07,480
the incompetence one is more believable
arm

821
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,630
the the the conspiracy or deliberate
attack

822
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:14,400
thing is it that was the intelligence
section at the Chinese embassy

823
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,390
and they were getting too big for their
britches in an area that we consider to

824
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,879
be our preserve

825
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,510
arm they were running arms and doing
other things and and it was a very

826
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:24,680
deliberate attack

827
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,850
I'm tryna I'm less inclined to believe
that

828
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,520
in part because I don't think they've
actually been very active out there

829
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:36,370
arm compared to what you're doing say
against the workers

830
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:40,460
arm the incompetence 1

831
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:45,010
and by the way as this was happening I
had a Russian 1997

832
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,150
10,000 scale map of belgrade

833
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:51,980
on my office wall from East few
publications

834
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,900
cease to cart iraq East you cartographic
in in Minneapolis which is my geospatial

835
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,569
counterpart the US government is very
reluctant

836
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:05,120
to use Russian military maps and other
foreign maps

837
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,660
because Jim clapper an NCAA really think
they can do a better job with one meter

838
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:10,609
imagery

839
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:16,950
and and the shuttle mission data which
got us the digital train elevation data

840
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:21,109
and so they try and create stuff on the
fly the promised enough fast enough

841
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:24,970
I have US government clients economy for
russian military maps and digital and

842
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,319
hard copy because in GA can't meet their
time deadlines

843
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,680
arm

844
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,580
let me diverge for just a moment I
really believe that imagery and

845
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,160
geospatial information is

846
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,250
extremely important element a but one of
the problems with relying on

847
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:44,089
classified imagery classified imagery is
basically like having a bucket full of

848
00:49:44,089 --> 00:49:45,870
postage stamps

849
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:49,600
and these postage stamps have been taken
at different years

850
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,180
different seasons different times of day
different angles

851
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:58,089
lock okay as when you combine all these
postage stamps

852
00:49:58,089 --> 00:50:01,060
with the digital terrain elevation data
you get something it's almost

853
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,880
incomprehensible

854
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,819
in my experience whereas if you take
commercial imagery

855
00:50:06,819 --> 00:50:11,529
10 meter spot which by the way and I had
to tell in GA that spot had two

856
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:12,650
satellites

857
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,109
which meant that it had a revisit a
shiner stove every two days not every 30

858
00:50:16,109 --> 00:50:16,900
days

859
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,319
okay but you take 10 meter commercial
imagery for the broad swath

860
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:24,509
you get a nice clean white area look

861
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:27,520
you bring in the digital terrain
elevation data then you slide in the

862
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,190
russian

863
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,839
it takes hundreds a man years to do the
data extraction from imagery

864
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:37,490
to convert that into a chart as cultural
features and contour lines and all that

865
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,839
and and then in the Chinese embassy case
you ask

866
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:44,339
defense attache that's been there
recently who will tell you have the

867
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:45,569
wrong address

868
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:50,130
in in this was the one target pic by CIA
and I actually believe that it was

869
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,560
picked in error

870
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,759
arm that's my personal belief I have no
access to privileged to classified

871
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,799
information

872
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:01,400
but truly in my 30 years or more %uh
experience in the Classified world

873
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,710
incompetence beats conspiracy every time

874
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:09,100
yessir you mentioned the Peace Corps
both the other morning and today

875
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,130
I was wondering what you saw was the
benefits the Peace Corps is it merely

876
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,520
the immediate benefits what the people
involved do

877
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,750
by building bridges and infrastructure
whatever or is it more

878
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:26,750
a better goodwill with other nature
nations on top of the immediate benefits

879
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:30,640
the peace corps should be tender fifty
times larger

880
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,490
and we should double or triple the the
salaries

881
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:39,560
and and the compensation are we should
do that as part of a larger integrated

882
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,940
strategy

883
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:45,420
there is no one in the US government
weather in the state department CR

884
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,779
anywhere there's no one in the US
government

885
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:51,319
that has a finger on every single US
government program going into any single

886
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:52,540
country

887
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:57,850
okay Selzer Don for example there are at
least 250 action officers

888
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:01,060
only 15 to 20 of whom are talking to
each other

889
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,830
ok ANSI have these obscure little on for
some programs in these obscure

890
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,770
little things and then if you add to
that all the faith-based diplomacy

891
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:12,630
and the NGO actions in the business
actions of its all outta control

892
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:17,799
arm Africa your question

893
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:21,330
extend to the peace corps has been all
whether it's merely immediate or whether

894
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:21,850
it has

895
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,100
long we can call to I I have come to the
conclusion

896
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:28,620
that we need to spend $500 billion
dollars a year on

897
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,410
overseas preventive measures

898
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:37,410
including having a minimal big war force

899
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,549
if we don't stabilize the world if we
don't stop illegal migration if we don't

900
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:45,130
stop treating women and children if we
don't stop ethnic criminal gangs and I

901
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:48,500
ethnic criminal gangs as one man one
bullet and I really don't give a shit

902
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,600
about a trial

903
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,290
arm you know we have to get tough

904
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:57,080
but the problem is we're not smart
enough to be tough when it's smart

905
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,259
enough to identify these guys and track
them down in their holes

906
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,400
are and at the same time

907
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,859
we're creating more terrorists every day
then we're killing

908
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:12,730
arm you know I think it's absolutely
ludicrous

909
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,120
to to be in Iraq as an occupying force
rather than as a

910
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:19,230
a peaceful force I think we busted the
piggy bank

911
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,779
are and so we need a national strategy
that is actually

912
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:26,529
coherent and uses all the instruments a
national power John I

913
00:53:26,529 --> 00:53:30,920
did a pretty good book on this not the
soft power book which is a shallow book

914
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,380
are but the earlier one on

915
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:39,440
well as a call to remembers john eyes
next the last book

916
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,010
now discovery more

917
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:47,020
in my area but anyway you can read my
reviews arm

918
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,960
there is no government program for
example for the pacific region

919
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,859
that says okay here all the State
Department programs here all the eighty

920
00:53:54,859 --> 00:53:58,040
programs for all the Peace Corps
programs here all special operations

921
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:02,690
and military programs and one other
things I told the guys at Fort Bragg is

922
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,000
your civil affairs since I up stuff
ain't worship for not delivering water

923
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,460
and food

924
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,520
I mean you can't do all the hearts and
minds crappy want but if we're not

925
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,009
delivering water and food it kinda lacks
credibility

926
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:18,589
arm and so the US government right now
David Abshire

927
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:21,750
wrote the world's longest job
description was call it was a book or

928
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,680
preventing World War three

929
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,210
the entire book was focused on
describing the position of counselor to

930
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,430
the president for strategic thinking

931
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:34,310
on and in my first book by and was
suggesting for major reforms

932
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,049
in the in the office of the presidency I
think the presidency has become too

933
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:40,339
complicated to just elect one man

934
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:44,140
who then Pixies bodies I think we need
to elect a team

935
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:47,830
I think presidential candidates need to
be required to identify their cabinets

936
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,410
in advance of Election

937
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:56,410
call

938
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,720
we need to have a national office a
strategic thinking

939
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,580
with a grand strategy division that
thinks ahead in a crisis management

940
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,440
division that manages interagency

941
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,130
operations to to respond to crises we
need to

942
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:14,020
elevate the intelligence community i'd
I'd make the next director National

943
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,950
Intelligence acquittal in the Federal
Reserve

944
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:20,060
a nonpartisan professional one of the
problems we have is most people

945
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,250
most e/c eyes have no clue what they're
doing all

946
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:26,280
they're coming in now to the political
side john layman will be an absolute

947
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,020
disaster

948
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,800
as a director of central intelligence
are if he gets

949
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,090
porter goss would be partially educate a
ble

950
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:37,600
arm but Porter still hung up on having
been a case officer:

951
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,990
and I think congressional oversight over
intelligence has been

952
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:45,690
are grossly negligent

953
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:49,580
for the past 10 years and supporters got
a lot to atone for

954
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:53,190
but I don't think you realize is that on

955
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,580
to the peace corps is an important piece
I think americans are

956
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,400
good-hearted decent people I would
particularly like to see s

957
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,760
sending out Muslim peace corps workers
are

958
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,330
no Muslim in my experience is gonna
listen to white boy from Kansas

959
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:13,170
arm and so we really need to leverage
our melting pot

960
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,820
and and we're not doing that let's leave
it there and come back to it

961
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,130
another time okay you can hit me I'll be
here till two

962
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:23,730
yessir we have the

963
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:27,830
triana are for moans to election

964
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:31,090
and the almost a

965
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,520
rule

966
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,440
to Park both government this

967
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,930
filming the something good be opened
this would be about

968
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,520
20 this them

969
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,890
October and the about 100 delivers

970
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,910
love opening subway New York

971
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,890
and they free us home

972
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:53,990
that

973
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,850
weekend fix borders

974
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:00,630
close borders to

975
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,650
you it came he is and

976
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:07,500
to 3 guys but the guys they can

977
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:13,930
attack easy and the Fremantle 21 will be
for example dirty bomb

978
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,520
some I biological your question

979
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,580
and eventual the some tone

980
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,348
like Subway would you think to if agree

981
00:57:24,349 --> 00:57:27,359
with your knowledge where we beat this
up doc

982
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,690
well first off I think there are

983
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,190
over a thousand sleeper people

984
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:38,520
in the United States and some of them
have married blonde blue-eyed Bates

985
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,630
and have had children but he's blond
blue-eyed babes

986
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:45,270
and they don't know that their cover for
action arm

987
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:48,599
that at some point in time the guy will
fill the soccer fan

988
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,730
with family and and use that to do
something really horrific that includes

989
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:53,300
suicide

990
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,920
arm so we have a lot of sleepers in the
United States

991
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,650
lotta Hamas a lot a Pakistani batboys
arm

992
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:04,140
and just to take an example from
Pakistan which is now exporting

993
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:04,859
terrorism

994
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:10,910
by official government policy to
Bangladesh cashmere Nepal Sri Lankan now

995
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:13,680
Phuket Phuket Thailand is a Bali waiting
to happen

996
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,020
a the south part of Thailand is mostly
Muslim

997
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:21,680
Malema slums and they basically been on
the short end of the stick

998
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,690
and I will come back to the United
States in a minute they've been on the

999
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,750
short end of the stick in terms of Thai

1000
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,230
cultural bigot isn't over them

1001
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,830
and so they get the bottom a barrel

1002
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:37,759
in terms of government assistance and
school projects and things like this

1003
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,720
on what's happening now is basically the
Pakistanis in particular are trying to

1004
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,910
export terrorism

1005
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,500
in the southern Thailand and they're
trying to they're trying to

1006
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,430
take these legitimate local grievances
and then turn them into

1007
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:56,410
armed insurrection of thailand is going
to become a lot uglier

1008
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:01,040
all in the next year or two early in
this year

1009
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,380
there were a large number of people
killed arm

1010
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:09,180
in Thailand now coming back to the
united states are this is Pakistani

1011
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,330
example in Naples

1012
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:13,500
we found twenty eight Pakistanis in an
apartment building

1013
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,599
with a hundred cell phones map civil
than 80 facilities

1014
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:20,260
and enough explosives to take out a
three-story building they are all over

1015
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:20,970
this country

1016
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:24,140
K closing the borders is not gonna stop
this

1017
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,569
and we can't close the borders anyway
it's impossible arm

1018
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:31,310
I've actually been out on a when I was a
CIA mid-career

1019
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,960
course which is like our war college are
I went out to the San Diego

1020
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,680
border and we watch them heard people
with horses arm

1021
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,660
you know it's it's impossible to control
our border

1022
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:47,730
with with the way things are going now
after 9/11 they stopped coming

1023
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:51,599
because they thought we might shoot them
are

1024
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,470
but after about two or three days they
figured out we wouldn't shoot them in

1025
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,160
the borders became porous again

1026
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,000
arm
