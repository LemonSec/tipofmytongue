1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,679
press to use the F word because they'll
threaten a a

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,049
cancel your card they did that with me

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,559
our next panel has media intervention by
a social and technical hacking with

know one thing: an author turned on at
least

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,669
is a stern Anya arm

10
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,630
yeah thanks for having us as a this will
be a little different for this

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,370
conference and

12
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,329
agree some other friends presented
earlier as well so or actually to arts

13
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:47,160
collectives

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,900
I representing two separate Arts
Collective here and we represent you one

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,820
project that we didn't collaborate in

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,710
a lot of our projects tendon va
communications technology social hacking

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:58,750
social engineering

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,300
comment hacking a very broad sense a the
idea of understanding reverse

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,370
engineering and in the courthouse
systems work in a

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,490
Anna trying to figure out ways to use a
manipulator systems finding new tactics

21
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,060
eyeliner in essence it was talking
earlier there's a there's a term contact

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,590
the media that gets tossed around

23
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,390
as new branding at this type of our
activism bland stuff

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,560
this project as I said was a
collaboration between my collective

25
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,610
carbon Defense League

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,549
and I'm on Tyler's a part of
conglomerate and powerful sick today

27
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,220
some gonna end up doing a lot of talking
home

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,850
really briefly to get into this what
this is is

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,790
as everyone seen Priceline dot com yes

30
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,970
you have this is a ream a Priceline dot
com that we built after trying

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,189
one day to come up with an idea are only
looking at

32
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,470
for filtering systems are in place in
trying to find ways to bypass those to

33
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,020
distribute real information

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,490
we're looking at things like Washington
Mutual Bank using revolutionary

35
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,960
advertising campaigns

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,299
the image is a che guevara at these
ideas above armed revolution the power

37
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,909
the consumer the power to name your own
price the venues now as advertising

38
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:05,619
campaign

39
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:09,489
leading-edge advertising by corporations
to sell us things or to make us think

40
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:09,959
that

41
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,739
we somehow our are involved in a
revolution by opening up a a checking

42
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:14,669
account that has

43
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:18,969
a low fine and no finance charge so
without my signed a commons good example

44
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,090
that we could carry their

45
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,779
their idea to its extreme and really
allow people to name their own price

46
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:29,040
in a way that arm was was it sometimes
I'm sorry but already being done with my

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,980
sticker switching

48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,260
bar code switching arm only there was
created a

49
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,358
publicly available database the people
get out information to

50
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,189
on produced an instructional video an
infomercial and explain how to go out

51
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:42,779
collect barcodes from what is
essentially a publicly available

52
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,499
database store shelves

53
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:48,230
or your or your receipt on up about
those including

54
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,679
a through name the item the product the
place was purchased the price

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,809
and store those in a database on and as
well search them you could show this is

56
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:00,999
a site that if you copy down the URL its
live for today but

57
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:04,918
it's been removed go on

58
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,029
got to the top in search for a Walmart

59
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:12,010
it's two words

60
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,909
I think on

61
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,298
what I'll do it in real time the user
screen generating display the bar code

62
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,680
for all these items which

63
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,280
I you can generally you could limited
you go to the church search for items

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,769
that are under 99 cents

65
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,790
on men you have these markers generate
print out with

66
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,909
sent on to produce a file-sharing
application at

67
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,290
change this information as MIDI files
who

68
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,970
show the first video now as well that we
produce that was originally on the site

69
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,079
on there was a commercial infomercial
it's about four and a half minutes long

when possible noting major brands and
their generic equivalents

using our convenient downloadable data

are able to easily know UPC ID number

for products for each area in the
country

100
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,440
a database which is more hours and yours
it's a simple concept

101
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,700
but replacing a product original UPC
barcode with the code above another

102
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,390
less expensive item sold at the same
store enables tremendous savings for you

be sure to take note packaging materials
for each product

109
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,590
to make the recording process simple

110
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,580
generate the product barcodes on the fly
using our custom barcode generator

111
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,510
application

112
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,330
you search results and cut copy and
paste resulting barcodes and any

graphical layout utility

114
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,020
or find a preform at a bar code should

115
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,520
for a store near you

116
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,620
after locating those you want in one of
these three ways

117
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,800
simply pressure bar codes on to label
paper available at most of its a player

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,090
electronics stores

119
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,539
and cut out your codes in preparation
for recoding in this example

120
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,750
Rico dot com customer locates the

121
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,470
serial he wants to purchase but which is
priced at an exorbitant

122
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,680
339 even locate the

123
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,099
very mad at bill it says you are priced
and printed at Ricoh dot com from the

124
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:54,878
computer as I come after us

125
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:00,080
he verifies the price for the breaks to
be a dollar 69 has noted on the site

126
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,789
given simply apprise the UPC barcode
label

127
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,710
over the top but the original the UPC
label

128
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,620
a simple process and one which will save
them a dollar seventy on this one item

129
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,219
alone

130
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:17,419
we encourage our customers to Rico and
brand-name items with generic item codes

131
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:21,359
through this process the customer pays a
more reasonable price for what is a

132
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,770
quite similar product

133
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,639
it is best to make only slight
adjustments such as these to avoid the

134
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,069
notice of our competitors

135
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:32,509
the chain stores in the major brands
they carry I'm

136
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:35,889
checking out the simple as demonstrated
by this customer

137
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:40,810
many stores even of urself scanning
checkups this is of course the easiest

138
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,360
way to scan your recoded items
undetected

139
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,539
in situations where this is not
available

140
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:49,370
cashiers will assist you through their
workplace boredom

141
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,139
only listening for me because they scan
your item rather than those in the

142
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,490
product name which the register might
display

143
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,540
again if recording brand-name products
using their generic equivalents UPC

144
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,790
codes it is likely that the registers
product name display will not appear all

145
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,740
that different

146
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,449
in this example both the

147
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,990
its and the breaks appear with the word

148
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,300
lakes in their name at the register this
helps the cashier to remain focused on

149
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,440
the beach rather than the product name
as this can away

150
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,230
your savings

151
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,120
course this requires some flexibility on
your part

152
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,190
but this is what allows you to save up
to 40 percent on brand-name products

153
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,940
every day our customers agree that the
savings and convenience we offer far

154
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,440
outweigh any tradeoffs

155
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,060
especially when the alternative is to
pay up to forty percent more for the

156
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,580
same thing somewhere else

157
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,279
that's it in a nutshell if you ready

thanks for using rico dot com and
welcome to the only way to save

160
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:57,040
so

161
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,959
on on the part of the video you heard
the beeping

162
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,050
that what we had headed out this video
because it was

163
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,699
take enough what we had to take it
offline later so it did say

164
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,350
Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and a generic
equivalent

165
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,050
value better valuable yet we bleeped out
those names for putting an online later

166
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,380
and and and this was the editor george
near-miss forgot to show you the real

167
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:19,760
one

168
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,400
right now sorry yeah so the reason it
came to that was so we we produce the

169
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,140
site it started to get popular

170
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,140
to require leave their blogs and things
in and then on

171
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,390
a series of stories appeared including
like Yahoo front page in Yahoo and and

172
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,910
even we can show a clip from CNN
Headline News you

173
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,959
on so the stuff I

174
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:44,080
become popular because im only because
the one reason initially discovered

175
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,140
popular with people who were supposedly
using it but then it got more popular

176
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,029
because Walmart

177
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,220
decided to issue a cease-and-desist
letter to close down the site

178
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,360
claim the rating in a bit aiding and
abetting theft and fraud

179
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,630
across state lines a federal crime with
a ten year mandatory minimum

180
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,680
sent om Walmart so huge that we

181
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,520
we learned really quickly that it's
really a strange company to deal with

182
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,079
because they have oppressed

183
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,850
PR team which is a separate legal team
they all issue separate press releases

184
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,400
they are

185
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,400
claim separate things they don't
actually communicate so when we had a

186
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,650
lawyer talking to their legal team on
our behalf

187
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,800
her legal team didn't believe their
press team who PR team was

188
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,820
issuing statements that they had
arrested people claiming to have used

189
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,230
our service therefore willing to testify
against us and put us in jail for this

190
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,810
federal crimes aiding and abetting

191
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,820
arm and Walmart also did an interesting
thing that I've never heard of before

192
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,060
which was calling

193
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,440
kellogg's arm and Price Chopper the
grocery store that we shot the video and

194
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,990
which we use to clipboard to do as well
on

195
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,010
and the that by shoppers

196
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,850
Sears a kellogg's contact the FBI and
the Federal Trade Commission

197
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,010
arm Walmart Ben afterwards issuing a

198
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,200
press release that they're moving toward
RFID tags quickly as possible

199
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,770
which we on others are exploitable nigga
arm

200
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,160
so we did this when he had to remove
this website we

201
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,670
we've basically the way it works in the
US we explain this on the on the new

202
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,510
site that is live right now which is

203
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,870
a remote Walmart dot com on which
explains it all

204
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,000
which we we're really glad Priceline
wasn't that big an enemy was like the

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,860
one Martin

206
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,420
when I have a personal vendetta with for
taking my parents land

207
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,300
under eminent domain came after us so um
wouldn't feel so bad for this is where

208
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,339
the site right now

209
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,990
on there to the desert that explains a
little bit more about our story idea

210
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,720
liberating capital or what's involved
with with Tom

211
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,550
this idea consumer staffers corporate
shaft is and are we

212
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,150
talk with this the idea that we need to
show people that actually arm

213
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,300
shop shoplifting or consumer staffed is
amounting to a far far lower Something

214
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,620
Corporate after as per year and we have
a lot of work to do to liberate cap on

215
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,480
even out that but distribution doing it
ourselves on since the courts are doing

216
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,890
it on so he has a river facts and
figures and things like that we also

217
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,569
added up

218
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,620
a follow up video with our spokesperson
Rico barco

219
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,050
the talking barcode so you can this is a
little longer and are some redundancy

220
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,930
because this clip from the first video
and some news clips and things

221
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,779
you can see the way that of course that
happens to a lot of projects like this

222
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:11,120
on when the press takes hold of them
it's really easy as you see with with

223
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,540
any

224
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,020
om person involved a specialized
community it really easy to

225
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,189
manipulate the presentation about person
be other om

226
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,279
whatever press campaign is launched so

00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:39,990
supplier electronic stores

308
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,669
and cut out your codes in preparation
for recoding we encourage our customers

309
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,380
to recode brand-name items with generic
item codes

310
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,269
price sticker switching has gone on for
ever we're not advocating switching

311
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:53,019
price stickers arm

312
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:56,799
nitpicking but the holidays approach if
you watch our videos pre

313
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,110
and from our perspective it's
understandable that this is humorous

314
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,620
joke has apparently been lost on
corporate giants like Walmart

315
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,080
April 2nd Walmart lawyer sent this
letter charging recall with encouraging

316
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,139
and facilitating

317
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,490
theft and fraud demanding immediately
shut down

318
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,809
not live anymore we people unfairly
removed it from the web last night but

319
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:20,928
not to go low comprise choppers says
that's not enough

320
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,610
it's not only encourage people to do
something illegal but it's enabled them

321
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,260
to do it

322
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,769
so far however long that the information
was available to people

323
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,720
on the damage was done not a gold says
price choppers investigating and she

324
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,740
says the FBI is investigating along with
the Kellogg corporation

325
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,210
meanwhile on Friday Rico said they had
ninety thousand hits

326
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,190
in one our thanks to the national and
international exposure

327
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,740
that we code is getting but they're not
worried that there's going to be any

328
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,760
legal action that they didn't say they
were now

329
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,250
worry they don't they are a little bit
concerned about what's at what's to come

330
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,539
at this point and I the corporation and
left the mine in my little punishment as

331
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:58,360
an example

332
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,529
just by Paul van Dyk yeah from Patons
fab

333
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:04,990
time and I think sometimes possible

334
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,070
certainly a possibility we'll have to
see how this playstop

335

yeah personal thanks I even tried my
best purple and have no I have happened

about how Apple iPod touch and iPad

346
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,300
free swimming fish that swam all

347
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,730
over the ocean and they don't have a
particular home they're just three

348
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,580
swimming in the deep ocean waters

349
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,090
and they retracted areas because the
temperatures and because the kind

350
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,959
abatements available for hunting

351
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,540
K and they're also very big fishermen
varying

352
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,409
opening up the stairs you guys an idea
of the different kind of fish

353
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,240
and where they live I want you to think
about their habitats

354
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,520
and what it would take your you can hide
in the reef the bottom fish

355
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,520
they could take down the same and don't
have a whole lot a way to protect

356
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,129
themselves but these guys

357
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,030
yes they protect themselves because
they're so big don't think it's right

358
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,060

00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,000
your to make barbarians written
instructions on how to pronounce demands

but

408
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:29,600
in trouble this site stop web sites from
Santa Barbara

409
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,929
this instruction manuals man I won by

410
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:36,749
back I parts I'm Walmart bass and that's
not mad because our

411
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:41,269
the song you know things like we learned
a lot of interesting rules we went

412
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,700
through this

413
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,990
laws that are in place like you can
publish deal this book abbie hoffman's

414
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,110
book in that legal

415
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,789
arm if you publish the same information
on the internet it's not arm

416
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:52,980
which is amazing and we also learned
that

417
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,710
the nine digit string not the actual
market itself is considered intellectual

418
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,080
property owned by

419
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,539
arm were administered the UPC also found
a God invented the PICU

420
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:05,899
UPC Cody who actually work for IBM

421
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:12,230
up north kitty and then Tom yeah and and
the reason that we actually poured on

422
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,990
the site we ended up doing it
voluntarily because the lawsuit threats

423
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,539
was

424
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,658
after legal consultation you find others
in our country with this amazing thing

425
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:19,350
where

426
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:24,850
if Walmart sues the two of us we have to
represent ourself defend ourself pay for

427
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,019
all those costs and even if we win the
lawsuit

428
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:30,779
I'm we stop air legal fees unless we
issue a counter lawsuit and prove that

429
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:32,059
it was a frivolous lawsuit

430
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:35,259
and are we looking a minimum you know
we're talking twenty thousand dollars to

431
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:36,019
go to court

432
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:39,210
and we would never won a frivolous
lawsuit case I'm kiss

433
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,539
course it wasn't for less they're
allowed their actually and supposed to

434
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,269
do things like defender copyright

435
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:48,639
kellogg's most to come after us at
otherwise they can lose the copyright

436
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:50,490
arm

437
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,820
so how's that project isn't this a to
put this in context in this is like

438
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,799
march/april 2003 that we did this
project and as a new product that I

439
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,860
wanna show you briefly

440
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:03,340
you can pop the PowerPoint om that

441
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,029
is a is for our corporate presentation
because our audience for this is

442
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:08,360
actually the porn industry

443
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,549
we feel that the porn industry is the
one industry that a

444
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:14,639
manages to lose a lot from a
conservative regime maintaining control

445
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,869
the White House in one actually has a
lot of money

446
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:20,419
well so com so

447
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:23,960
weaves launched on July 4 the website
called after the vote dot com

448
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,669
his life are currently low corporate

449
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:33,940
presentation miss

450
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,289
a if you know rock the vote right
everyone knows rock the vote that's

451
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:41,980
from the US here and can't get assaulted
register to vote through rock-n_-roll

452
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,389
an arm we we sense managed to make
contact with rock the vote after

453
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:51,190
watching fucked over arm so fuck the
vote is based on this concept that

454
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,809
that a liberals are much hotter the
conservatives and the most conservatives

455
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:55,289
ur

456
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:58,850
highly were professionally or Preston
word would benefit greatly from

457
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,580
being petted by wanna Bahat liberals
want to or not FTV models

458
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,039
com so we feel that we we could actually
use the start managing upcoming election

459
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:07,480
by

460
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,440
a having pledge sheets next page but
ninth

461
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,159
say how it works L we have this idea
that we me to look good tax ex: the in

462
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,359
fine we're concerned as hang out with
can sometimes be confusing because

463
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,199
unfortunately a lot of hip you they're
confused as being liberal in their

464
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,749
actually

465
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:25,580
quite conservative I'm using these Terms
liberal-conservative very

466
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,029
liberally so keep in mind that its arm

467
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:32,299
you can make connection and you need to
actually begin a conversation it may not

468
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,999
be need to be about politics or about
the upcoming election

469
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,179
I'm most likely the person you're about
to bed doesn't vote anyway

470
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,429
on so it might be easy to get them to
cast a vote on

471
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:44,690
in favor wat you can persuade a lot of
partners vote

472
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,169
as their other partners do sexual
partner so there's that's right ways to

473
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,179
persuade one another

474
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:52,690
om and sex is a great way to do that and
get her during

475
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,279
during sex you pull out your pledge she
and ask for signature

476
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:01,019
absolve arm are you do it after sex but
that's not recommended

477
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,690
%ah and then we ask for a copy the
pledge sheet and for that were turned

478
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,460
you up

479
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,980
the fuck about after the dot-com condom
on

480
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,320
governments I don't know last year so
this isn't a test XI port for this

481
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,210
presentation that that everyone actually
want to have sex and only 15 percent

482
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,639
adult in america having hapless axo but
that mean eighty-five percent are having

483
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,259
the other half

484
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:26,769
on 2010 adopt either these are actually
statistically come from the from a

485
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:31,619
really reliable source from Rush
Limbaugh transcript hope

486
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:35,169
about while I sacked by liberal sex laws
are

487
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:38,990
destroying our country's moral or
something one in 20 adults in america

488
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,779
had sex more than three times a week I
mean 19 happen

489
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:47,779
phobic those nineteen million ahead we
might have to do our own poll but

490
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,250
for Viper alley we think they have
applied everywhere this politicians as

491
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,279
ministers they are

492
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:55,519
international bankers they all wanna
have sex and someone can

493
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,599
can move on even even

494
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,439
recently you know we've seen Jack Ryan
has come out

495
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,369
it because it has divorce filings being
public you know jack ryan this

496
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:10,379
this next hopeful for the for the
presidential sleeps come up in the

497
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:11,080
futures

498
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,279
is now a sexual deviant and I'm we think
there's a lotta Republican sexual

499
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,679
deviance out there that

500
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:19,879
it should be you know this is a tactic
we feel they cannot be appropriated by

501
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:20,599
the right

502
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,099
because their moral opposition to such a
thing so even though he'd feel it deep

503
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,549
down they might

504
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:28,769
be into that whatever Jack Ryan thinking
they're I am

505
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:32,419
they can't really express it would help
them express it there are meet ups

506

one the greatest things we got with the

554
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,760
ricotta site was a lot email I hate mail

555
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,400
like initially when it was on blog site
a lot of people writing in support

556
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,070
understood it and some it it's something
that wasn't

557
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,260
quite sad pirates its we said it was but
it wasn't really satire

558
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,640
can work and a lot of these projects
like this it's sorta satire but it

559
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,450
somewhere else too because it can work
so what we did was talk of the emails

560
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:54,250
arm a a I don't know Throwdown see if we
can find

561
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,590

hey whatcha people I'm find a bat on it
that bad either great they normally

563
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,129

or um love it or leave it

565
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,050
were boy where did you boys study
economics Holland go but there was a

566
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,810
good one

567
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,770
you can see the amazing the flooded in
on a matter like two days when he

568
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,820
blessed the economics Mister Rogers
neighborhood your antics and rich boy

569
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,909
tactics clearly show you must have felt

570
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,630
snubbed at daddies and mommies Country
Club growing up

571
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,660
pickup area back home and asked him to
bother to wash

572
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:32,790
your deck for you

573
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,428
II

574
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:39,470
I've never really been in a country club
before but its a sound like Bon Iver to

575
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,080
his

576
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,899
a yeah im

577
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,130
those of us who are honest have to pay
for your stupidity I suggest you find

578
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,030
something better to do with your time
and run your stupid website

579
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,530
you're doing a disservice to customers
consumers the back is that Walmart has

580
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,510
benefited millions of people by offering
products at lower prices

581
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,260
back to you they're mocking strength and
know how to achieve this is to their

582
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,730
credit

583
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,799
your efforts to hurt them a really
misguided so we learned that apparently

584
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,220
I have no nothing up in economics but
the people that write us do in

585
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,940
yep

586
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,030
the have as a lotta hatred out there in
a

587
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:22,030
note going on who question yep

588
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,250
knockout repeated 2020 said it's not
easy he said they couldn't you

589
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,850
accomplish the same thing the same goal
by producing a site

590
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,240
that produced boss Parker's Obama that
has weed problem

591
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,880
we could however I think there's
something interesting your operating

592
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,370
this gray area is one of the things that
that product itself address that I liked

593
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,280
a lot was intellectual property rights

594
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,149
was going on saying why why why is it
somehow legal for me to take with all my

595
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,180
cash register receipt and share it with
someone else or what's on the store

596
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,540
shelves and that they were essentially
saying just about UPC ID number

597
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,659
natural property it was a database that
we were stealing from them

598
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,950
we should have had cut had had rights to
have or share

599
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,389
which not address an issue that I'm
personally interested in that we would

600
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,730
never addressed if we were sharing

601
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,260
boss information we would have also Ben
misrepresenting to the wrong audience

602
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,590
because the people that are

603
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,720
that would actually use the site to
steal I don't want to get caught

604
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,649
I what we are playing in and still holds
true as the people that were

605
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:27,739
with are going to steal will continue to
steal I am

606
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,149
and will this is not a man I mean the
funny thing in the absurdity of Rico dot

607
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:34,989
com is that you could do it with a
photocopy machine I mean it's pretty

608
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,909
absurd

609
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,659
generated with the with since the
current sir Don

610
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:45,280
yet what price stickers before market
existed

611
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,899
I agree with you when was the FBI upset
with us

612
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:55,600
we can happen they're probably here and
I i'm

613
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,480
I'm tryna I agree with you exactly but
but so we're not saying it's a new act

614
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,620
but why would this new act when
translate over to website

615
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,009
one is that there aren't a lot there to
protect things are occurring on the

616
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,500
Internet which there are

617
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,010
because there's a history with book
publishing I could publish the same

618
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,880
there are books about you BC I decode
the Republic steal this book has tons a

619
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,530
tactic that

620
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:19,480
you can still use today to to rip off
people on anarchist cookbook is still

621
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,540
still publishing available on you can do
these things I mean I had it in my copy

622
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,080
summer we had in our kids cookbook when
I was 13

623
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,450
and if I can get out why is this website
suddenly

624
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:36,450
FBI information was this

625
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:40,289
or maybe people don't really understand
the books won't be read

626
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:47,289
um yes some I am let's give Mike a

627
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:52,180
does it isn't okay thanks on the names
Logica did the article on barcode

628
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,848
tricks ira some technical things I've
we're gonna do it through normal

629
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:56,390
check-out

630
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:00,200
it is possibly card even that's not
likely on to do it if you gonna do it

631
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,989
yourself check out as he has mentioned
it

632
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:05,950
are one issue gotta worry about is way
yet with some scandal you might the

633
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,950
longer you don't worry about Home Depot
does

634
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,578
we lose weight on the a.m yeah actually
the with Walmart there's actually an

635
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,269
option where you are can

636
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:16,640
skip our baggage so you don't worry
about Wat com

637
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,489
another thing another little trick a
shadow on my part apartment not meaning

638
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:20,950
I do

639
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:24,259
I would do in a paint a.k.a on

640
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:27,880
I'd I just liked it because it's it's
not as easy yes you can understand what

641
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,779
to do in town

642
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:32,400
and one other thing another way to do
things which explain

643
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,369
there's you can actually taken a pen is
on its not glossy and if you really good

644
00:36:36,369 --> 00:36:37,789
you can actually thinkin

645
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:41,039
and widen the lines in turn into
different code it's really hard now

646
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:41,900
because there's

647
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,430
there's so many price out there and just
a cupboard one it may not be a national

648
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:45,989
number

649
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:49,170
on even if you get actual numbers may
not actually be a real code yeah

650
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,349
but it is possible and it's been done at
two different serial that grants is but

651
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,670
yeah

652
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,670
and this is also something or use the
social hockey if someone if you are

653
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,369
caught use

654
00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:02,119
you you have to just play dumb and also
you can scan a barcode from a phone tip

655
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,420
I got a barcode run and here's an image
and you can to scan it under their

656
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,749
on and planning to want to use it as a
prize VIP card

657
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:14,019
that many GBS awesome

658
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:18,410
the I mean it's clear that the things
that

659
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,589
that corporations and the FBI in touch
we'll learn if the

660
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:26,099
that and with this case you we learned
that Walmart should have realized that

661
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:26,640
by

662
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,160
coming after us all they did was elevate
this the story and make it

663
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,499
a national headlines in a local one arm
which is

664
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:37,239
to their you know to their fault they're
gonna end up being hurt more by if they

665
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:41,569
think they're actually hurt by it it's
things like this happen exploit always

666
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:45,710
exist but without the vote after her to
calm it's also something that's that's

667
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,049
perfectly legal and I

668
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:51,109
with these projects in both of them at
least I soon afterwards perfectly legal

669
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:55,140
we'll find out soon um quick

670
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,308
request there's no money involved your

671
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:02,420
quick question arm I system

672
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:05,859
this is like the Capital District how
long did it take for the

673
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:09,420
the Walmarts to get the word out to the
other Walmarts hours

674
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,950
I was pretty fast I don't arm we
actually we gotta stand from a Walmart

675
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,249
internal publication that

676
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:18,859
on a place on us that Walmart published
an article on the internal publication

677
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:19,410
came out

678
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:23,078
about two months later arm warning a
morning about this

679
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,910
um and that's actually on the website as
well as look at idle

680
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,788
I don't know because we were just
talking so

681
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:34,279
basically the site launched first week
in April good what about a

682
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:39,319
mission Mike Price Chopper was the last
to get involved that we know of

683
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:42,890
we didn't hear about price choppers
involvement till the day evening news

684
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,328
until that story came up because the the
first was definitely Walmart

685
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:50,239
and then an employee at Kellogg Scott
arm with emailing us and then

686
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,819
a calling us to let us know that his
bosses people that he had never seen

687
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:54,640
before

688
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,749
he said he was the first person to show
to people is work and they were

689
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:00,700
overlooking his computer and suddenly
people he never saw were watching over

690
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,529
his computer and

691
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:05,910
and and there's a listless reverse class
action lawsuit was forming

692
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,519
while we were talking to this guy online
and this is all happening in a matter of

693
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,930
days workers while we were

694
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,308
we're faster than had a lot of friends
helping us out with lawyers in such om

695
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:18,690
yet it happened really quick and it died
I really quick recap it live

696
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:23,579
without it for about about two or three
weeks after the cease and desist letter

697
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,759
and then we finally put it down only got
hate mail from everyone saying that you

698
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:28,960
know we were willing to go to jail for
our beliefs and

699
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,410
and to defend the freedom by kurds I was
not willing to be jailed for 10 years

700
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,460
knowing the right

701
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,690
I am but yeah there we should

702
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,249
is ask more questions than a lot of
stuff that's being done like this for

703
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:43,430
tachometer stopping

704
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,328
good I

705
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,619
yeah this is another interesting if this
is BFF got involved at one point because

706
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:51,249
um

707
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:55,329
and this is dumb when our parts Asian
are you are geniuses understand that

708
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,359
this is done our part

709
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,328
this is registered under legal name and
then it was it was but it was a

710
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:03,450
it was hidden a third domain

711
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,910
anonymizer I'm asking service who is
masking service called domains by proxy

712
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,950
that company was initially issued a
cease-and-desist letter not me

713
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,710
personally

714
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:16,170
arm they contacted us and said we have
the specs letter for you from

715
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:20,759
wal-mart Stores on the FedEx it to us
artifacts at us we read the letter

716
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:23,319
and we said this what you gonna do about
this means we're not gonna do anything

717
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:24,599
about this

718
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,039
on which we're not breaking the law and
they said well we're gonna have to

719
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,819
terminate your service I said show us
where

720
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:34,029
way five is where we're coming by
turning our service what we've broken

721
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:34,900
next thing we knew

722
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,359
determine our service released our
information to Walmart arm without

723
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:40,910
telling us why determine our service so

724
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,129
their idea being an anonymizer was it up
it's a false company it

725
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,299
with if not this then who does it really
anonymized the FF got involved at that

726
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:51,519
point to help

727
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,819
we could add if we if we have been
smarter in advance

728
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,829
wrong with missus at that point it had
everything they had

729
00:40:57,829 --> 00:41:01,339
everything because we what we when we
did this this is actually

730
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:04,719
we arent or the time Ronnie Moore it was
a it was a spring break

731
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,019
thing I was like well we have a couple
weeks let's do this it's funny

732
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:11,289
it's something you we talk it when the
product if you talk about

733
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:14,369
you never actually do we had a couple
weeks so we did it we did actually a

734
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:15,749
matter for four days

735
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:18,779
put online then all the stuff happen
with that we weren't planning for we

736
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:20,049
didn't actually expect

737
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:23,200
we thought maybe price I'll get a little
past and that would be it

738
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,119
never expected Walmart to get he did
about her to become as

739
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,219
a bigger I we've never dealt personally
until then with anything

740
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:34,619
that was that sir he did we never had to
worry about the FBI knocking on a door

741
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:35,779
that we know

742
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:39,089
but then it came out but also you know
you have other projects the work done in

743
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:40,430
the past that are now

744
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,430
om if they've been done within seven
years and we had

745
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,649
Mike to your group published I'm game
with Maddox

746
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,799
on om how to reverse engineering replace
ron shipp's in game with

747
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,219
up about him done in ninety-eight was
published in 2000

748
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:57,349
which meant this was occurring 2003
which meant we were still

749
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:01,150
punishable because we actually put a
book out I'm with another person's voice

750
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,609
over who's now being investigated

751
00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:05,609
and now indicted by the FBI on

752
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:08,980
who is also an artist to doing nothing
illegal who's talked about

753
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,009
earlier this morning I believe 11 a.m.
session Steve Kurtz which

754
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:15,390
that's actually link to see a defense
fund authority should look at

755
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:18,670
the persecution it works like this that
starting to happen in our country are

756
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,219
starting to look at tactical media

757
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:24,119
arts artists showing up at showed up at
the mass Mokhtar exhibit opening it

758
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,239
works like this

759
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:28,559
arm to to subpoena people and they're
