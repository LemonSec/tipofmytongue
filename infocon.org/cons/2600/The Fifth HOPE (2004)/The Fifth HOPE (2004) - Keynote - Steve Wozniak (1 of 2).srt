00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,100
arm somebody today as

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,470
you're talking a Cheshire his great
phone number I'm a collector need phone

44
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,019
numbers

45
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,030
really started with the thing I had
called I'll a joke you need a good

46
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,260
number she didn't get 2009 calls a day

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,630
and want the numbers like had was 22 1
1111

48
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,418
why a lot of us in this room where the
kinda curious

49
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,100
22 1111 by the rules of assigning phone
numbers

50
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,400
back them that was the shortest distance
you could dial

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,250
on a tile phone if doubt phones still
exist so it's kind of like pure -ism why

52
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,329
it was so much better you get no other
number

53
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,949
the only had two two's in five months
got a million calls on it all the time

54
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:22,949
they hung up

55
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:26,650
until one day I was booking a flight
which turned out to be pan am

56
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,560
so next the next time I got a call I
heard them start

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,930
I said hello next starting in opposite
or you can pan am and the lady said

58
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,540
oh yeah as it were on a lunch break so
what can I do for your

59
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,079
book my first like that day

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,960
after about a couple weeks I figured all
the police are going to be

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,650
you know triggered on this i'm looking
for. who's getting people to go to the

62
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,410
sales airport at three in the morning

63
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,240
to catch flights at the Nexus so I
started always telling people the end

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,860
the call

65
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,870
I'm just joking you know how hard it is
to get people to believe that a chuckle

66
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,350
the chocolate sale how much is it for
the ticket no I'm just joking

67
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,350
one other so I started trying to stretch
it out sometimes what we do is a little

68
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,829
psychological game

69
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,620
how much Kenya can you get people to buy
into how far can you to see

70
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,010
so I started playing this game love the
grasshopper special had the lowest

71
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,349
flights if you go through our leisure
used airports

72
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,230
and I would make up places like billings
montana Moscow Idaho Amarillo Texas

73
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,690
if you bounce around all the cities and
get your destination 5 hops

74
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,120
your flight can be cheaper I'll it one
day someone there told the sky

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,860
you go to you go to Las Vegas ebook to
our booth n roll the dice

76
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,850
to get a7 the next leg is free any body
and do it

77
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,940
the I started trying to sell propeller
service flights 30 hours to London the

78
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,310
guy wouldn't take it by did so a 20-hour
flight to New York

79
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,710
and so

80
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,340
you know and we're and I got a lot of a
lot on my good phone number stories one

81
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,520
I like the best what might a tentative
date

82
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,840
but I used to get calls on the phone I
use at night it was somehow this

83
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,190
if if you forgot to dial one before the
free 888 numbers which eventually came

84
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:08,910
into existence

85
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,330
if you doubt the service called bored
housewives

86
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,630
you get my phone in bed at two in the
morning so

87
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,310
what you do when a person calls you and
their

88
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,750
they're off on a different tangent that
reality they think they have called

89
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,540
bored housewives but they've really
called Steve Wozniak would you do their

90
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,610
mind to me is in a creative state

91
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,780
them they're mine has invented a story
to me

92
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,680
and I wanna see how far that creative
state you don't ever want to inhibit

93
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,400
creativity

94
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,520
right so the word to use is yes

95
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,599
whatever they say in a wrong numbers on
just a paramedic I picked up this phone

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,890
all is a bronco yeah is a white bronco

97
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,479
yes is by the reservoir yes where you
going

98
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,919
I don't know i got to hang up now it's
too much time on this call so

99
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,520
you know I don't know there's a lot of
people that don't really grow up

100
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,000
with kinda sense a humor that might be
it's somebody else's disadvantage in

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,910
small ways

102
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,070
and I forget there is a name for this
book

103
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,159
those of us who've been down the PALS
we've been down haven't important

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,780
curiosity

105
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,780
really it starts with your babies you
take any baby girl hackers every baby is

106
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,750
trying to push its way out at the crib

107
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,870
you know crawling around looking at
every door every cabinet trying to open

108
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,789
it or touch things and knock them over

109
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:31,510
they're all babies and that kinda get
talk by people

110
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,330
what the rules are where you can go
where you can what's the shape

111
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,120
your maze but somehow God or nature

112
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
whoever makes us has made us that way
from the start

113
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,050
and a lot of us like to get pleasure
from the unexpected

114
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,710
what is a show everyone grows up with
jokes in every culture and that's the

115
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,030
biggest

116
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,610
so many humor you tell a story along one
line

117
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,660
and the punchline is something you
didn't expect a different story that fit

118
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,490
the words

119
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,669
and getting pleasure from the unexpected
isn't that unusual

120
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,560
but like I said there are some people
cannot laugh at jokes methods are some

121
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,830
people to hear a joke and I think it's
the truth

122
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,090
arm we have dreams

123
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,940
so often that we're trying to do the
things that aren't supposed to be

124
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,719
possible

125
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,760
who would have thought in 1971 that

126
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,330
if you put sometimes into your own home
phone you could dial

127
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,349
anywhere in the world 1971 you couldn't

128
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,800
reach the world I mean it was so
expensive

129
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,210
nobody had much for the community
outside their own local community

130
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,530
except maybe ham radio operators okay

131
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,690
I'm not and but another thing is you
know this is

132
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,560
element what we're doing has some kind
of learning

133
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,710
educational value it's largely because
work always trying to do the best for

134
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,099
tried

135
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:51,520
out do some other people we're trying to
find slip-ups

136
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,770
they had in their cold or or things that
they didn't think would work this way on

137
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,460
phone come

138
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,610
searching and searching and searching
but it's really a way of sayin

139
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,380
I did something more than someone else
i'd its I did the unexpected

140
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,419
such a way that we can somehow post and
socialize

141
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,700
I met someone who was a psychology
student once the taught me that

142
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,710
well there's a group of people the sort
if I was in that category while I was in

143
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,880
college

144
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,520
and they're kind of like so she'll
socially

145
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,910
backwards and out antisocial a bit earth
there

146
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,470
they don't communicate well and to
communicate it comes out as antisocial

147
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,490
behavior

148
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,360
little pranks and that sort of thing and
somehow that's a way of

149
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,690
touching other people on having a
back-and-forth communication

150
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:39,849
substitutes for the normal and you know
sometimes and think gosh I was so shy

151
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:40,940
and quiet

152
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,290
and sometimes by designing something
good or doing something unexpected

153
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,319
all the sudden i'd have people to talk
to me and my mom

154
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,610
it would open up my shell and I have
something to talk about maybe it was too

155
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,079
techy

156
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,350
the time but we really wouldn't have

157
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,290
today's technology the computers the
Internet we wouldn't be this advanced in

158
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,030
the world

159
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,140
if it weren't for basically people doing
what's called

160
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,260
hacky and what we actors like to do and
you know play around see how far we can

161
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,220
get

162
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,490
it turns out that almost every major
advance really new thing the startling

163
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,150
you talk to the people that invented
later life and they all go back to their

164
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,860
stories with blue boxes

165
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,870
and their stories you know other kinds
of electronic bring some fun in there

166
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,240
almost none from work

167
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,540
likes have a serious business student
account type personality

168
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,160
so really would be who knows how far
back which would be

169
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,939
well you know when I think back to my
own self as a hacker it's like

170
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,160
all the things that would motivate you
know know but it's really going to find

171
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,010
what is hacker

172
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,640
where does it come from but there are
psychological studies

173
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,910
what cause what can motivate you as a
teacher you find out that is much less

174
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,030
important the words that you use

175
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,040
then if you can inspire the kids to
wanna learn make it interesting to them

176
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,550
make it fun make them smile macomb
you're given praise

177
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,959
the going back to the the book to spend
more time studying the water

178
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,220
and the you wanna learn you learn more
than if you don't wanna learn

179
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,430
that's much more important is to
motivate students and to communicate

180
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,839
content information but is as you know

181
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,949
as hackers working our projects were
motivated very much

182
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,949
by humor somebody laughs

183
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:22,770
we make somebody laugh I don't know what
it is I don't know why that while after

184
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,589
good

185
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,510
you know for a lot of us we get the
prestige been able to post about what we

186
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,839
were able to accomplish

187
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,470
that other people didn't know about that
was possible in the world

188
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,800
obviously doing the best and very often
trying to be perfect

189
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,380
it was like the early phrase hackers
that came from model railroad club: in

190
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,310
at MIT it was looking over type the code
rewriting it everybody took

191
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,959
handed rewrote one here better and it
was somehow

192
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,949
simpler or somehow everyone look at it
and say back is the perfect

193
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:55,770
old wanna get it little better than any
other human could do

194
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,089
we're obviously not voted motivated by
money I don't really see a lot of money

195
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:01,829
in this room

196
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,540
well you know what no i i get mine wat
trust me

197
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,050
I'm because night didn't do the stuff
for money

198
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:12,490
on & Stroock turns out that

199
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,930
it turns turns out that

200
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,970
on into their on getting there I mean

201
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,240
you know I can get into the start Apple
that regard but

202
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,020
funny thing is there's a lot of society
says that money

203
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,620
causes technological advancement and
causes change that improves people's

204
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,250
lives

205
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,980
but really you know it's somebody being
motivated the right way on the inside

206
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,199
wanting to solve the big problems that
really come up with the great inventions

207
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,030
in the great steps forward

208
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:47,980
and we have a system system a business
models that work

209
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,530
and tax laws that per that protected
them and

210
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,569
other you know laws that you know you
can't

211
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,670
me start a business you can't even let
your employees be free and pay their own

212
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,160
way to hotels I mean

213
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,350
get so complicated but turns out we have
a system so based on money

214
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,030
and here we are trying to develop
technologies

215
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,600
a bar owner whatever we can get our
hands on figure out something that's

216
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,360
ours and not there's

217
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,470
and created away into a system maybe

218
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,189
before creating something without money
yeah were threat

219
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:23,469
to the people say that it takes money to
do it yeah were terrorists

220
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,929
were tears were threatened where threat
to the normal way of making products

221
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:27,890
with money

222
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,439
were threat to the financial models love
the Western

223
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:38,439
you know culture as we don't cuz we
don't do what we do for riches

224
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,530
will when I was young

225
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,890
Mike dad was probably the most important
influence in my life

226
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,309
and heaped on the Caltech and he would
tell at the dinner table sometimes

227
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:53,719
summer the pranks that they had done at
Caltech

228
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,920
you know panels on these pranks involved
electronics and computers and some

229
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,199
didn't but they were you know what i sat
there and I

230
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:03,760
didn't he didn't instruct here's how you
do pranks

231
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,819
I heard the stories and it was fun and I
laughed

232
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,920
and that laughter inside I told myself I
am going to be

233
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,800
a prankster I am gonna do pranks like
that my life

234
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,010
the next telling one is kinda like my
son early days a video games he sat down

235
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,699
with early nintendo's and play them very
young

236
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:24,630
and one time he came to me says I you
know you ask them what you think you're

237
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,890
gonna be in your life

238
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,870
we want to be your legs as I don't know
I'm gonna be a game player

239
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,300
so it's kinda like you know you make
this little commitments yourself for

240
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,140
what you're going to do and how you're
going to be

241
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:42,140
and some mismanaged live up to those
those youthful ideals our lives

242
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,390
well you know what really pisses me off
is when I

243
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,050
try to tell a joke and somebody thinks
it's real won the first one to try it

244
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,439
took a little sign to a convention error

245
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:56,880
political event said ham radio operators
have Sarah school unanimously support

246
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,339
richard nixon for governor

247
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,689
it was a joke I was the only its ham
radio operator

248
00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:05,510
and sixth-grade the flashbulbs all went
off

249
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,679
the they put my picture on the front
page in San Jose Mercury

250
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:13,020
the press treated and they said a school
group representing the school group

251
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,309
you know how to get it so wrong so

252
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,679
I'm glad for those of us who kinda you
don't know where things are at one

253
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,579
need be well

254
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,870
love it one other things

255
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,959
okay I've had a lot of different
occupations think what path to go here

256
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,500
in six grade I didn't feel the ham radio
back in those days you didn't just buy

257
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,069
it learns said rules to use it like
today

258
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:41,809
you actually got to San capacitors and
resistors and

259
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:46,020
sockets and pieces of metal and cabinets
and you put everything together

260
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,480
according to hundreds of pages

261
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,530
construction you built it yourself you
knew the value up

262
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,350
you saw finished product you use the
finish product in the end

263
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,870
you had built it yourself autonomously
on your own schedule

264
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,970
arm and that was very motivational

265
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,110
and a lot of what we do you know we know
the value

266
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,309
when you're working for a company on
their computer you know

267
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:13,219
loans the computer and what your limits
are and it's not yours

268
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,500
and also a lot of us grew up with 1 I'm
computer for that reason

269
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,630
six great I got my first transistor
radio

270
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,209
this was so unbelievable 1961 I can hear
all those songs

271
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,660
every although hit songs in 1961 to this
day your you know Mike

272
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,850
mice you know the the center Mike or

273
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,240
the Line six tonight even but I am so I
got my transistor radio must talk my dad

274
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,740
who worked at Lougheed

275
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,490
on missiles and he was showing me how
they were putting transistors and

276
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,280
tighter and tighter configurations

277
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,549
to have less weight because wat matters
for missiles it costs money

278
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:49,530
and he said they were gonna come out
with chips and chips were gonna have

279
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,069
more than one transistor on them

280
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:54,290
to get it even smaller and lighter and I
said

281
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,849
oh wow so they're gonna make even better
transistor radios

282
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,069
I said they're going to develop this
technology for human bean stew

283
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:04,949
this in the better radios they said no
they really develop the technology for

284
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:08,860
the military and the government who can
afford it and then what trickles out

285
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,089
comes to human beans in consumer
electronics

286
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,360
net can always bothered me I was kinda
wanna the needs a normal human being

287
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,290
living a life

288
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,439
in a house 21 normal fun things with
friends

289
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,770
to kinda drive the world and I sorta
learned that well as a different part of

290
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:25,270
the world you don't see when you're done

291
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:29,069
dad asked me about that time what do you
wanna be when you grow up

292
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:33,360
set for someone to be an engineer like
you because I was good math already

293
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,870
and second I said I'm gonna be a
fifth-grade teacher likeness crack

294
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,870
as everybody remembers the teacher that
saw your potential and respected you for

295
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,170
being

296
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,620
good at something and really you know
make you feel like this teacher

297
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,880
care was gonna be a big partier future

298
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,020
and might have been good to teach me
that the value of education

299
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,350
that we the younger generation the older
generation

300
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,020
has a really screwed up world and it
doesn't work right people don't get

301
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,819
along and there's a lot of problems in

302
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,540
with the younger generation gonna study
in school and we're gonna be

303
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,609
were to come out we're gonna make a
better world when we grow up

304
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,870
well may not work out that way but i
still pass that message on every young

305
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:14,579
person this close to meet with my own
kids

306
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,480
as I got into by Kanaka high school I
was real good accomplished knowledgeable

307
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,110
at computers in logic and building
things like that

308
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,120
and I was down my electronics teacher
did some really good

309
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,820
he said Steve knows all the electronics
in school and he found a way to get me

310
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,428
to work at a company

311
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:36,679
in town program in a computer we didn't
have computers and high school

312
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,190
I got to program a computer this was
like the match in every word

313
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,340
I didn't know there were jobs in
computers a person could ever do it this

314
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,169
was like the most

315
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,280
amazing miracle in a lifetime first
program I wrote was

316
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,750
the Knights gambit where you try to jump
a night across a chessboard

317
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,770
every square exactly once I have a
computer

318
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,010
a million things a second I'm a human
being I can do about one thing a second

319
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:00,799
maybe

320
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,940
so I wrote this program in the lights on
the computer flickered and Flickr on

321
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,450
Flickr

322
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,809
flickered and nothing happened are

323
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,110
tonight go through learning well the
next I find the truck burnout chess

324
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,640
boards I saw that the program's working
exactly as I wanted to

325
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,580
but it was gonna take 10 the 25th years
to get a solution

326
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,360
just because some things fast doesn't
mean it can compete with the human mind

327
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,559
can come up with a good approach our
algorithm

328
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,480
on I started I ran across mike first
computer man

329
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,990
down in Sylvania I saw timetable said
said I'm small computer man

330
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,370
PTPA many in the room I remember that oh
my gosh

331
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,730
I was so intrigued there was actually
book within

332
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,740
I sighed at me about a computer what it
was and somebody said you want

333
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,549
you can happen I took apple.com and
studied

334
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,710
by then I had booked to the first chips
now the first chips

335
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,190
had like one gate on a chip one and gate

336
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,679
one or gate on a chip and the chip cost
50 bucks with sprite 500 bucks today

337
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,870
these things were not for humans like me
but

338
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,280
the I have the manuals and they were
least virtual

339
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,030
so i sat down and started trying to
design this my version this computer the

340
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,760
PDP 8

341
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,240
and after a while they were better I
designed

342
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,890
screwed lousy design there's after a
while I had a weekend free design a

343
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,740
little better

344
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,500
and then some better chips came out
designed again a little better

345
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,799
now I another minicomputer came out and
I got the manafort

346
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,350
and design 1 and it became my hobby of
every few weeks

347
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,250
I would just sit down on paper and do my
own design for all the various many

348
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,049
computers from

349
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:42,120
digital equipment very and Hewlett
Packard

350
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,490
digital and Deccan data general on you
would know all the names the company's

351
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,590
and became ill love of mine where'd you
get computer manual stopped there were

352
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,959
no computer stores packed them into
places

353
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,900
there were no microprocessors or
anything like that either arm

354
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,700
a friend of mine and I would drive up on
Sundays to Stanford Linear Accelerator

355
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,750
Center

356
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,200
slack because a lot of smart people work
at slack

357
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,410
and wherever smart people work doors are
unlocked

358
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,850
and we would we would go around the back
and eventually climb stairs and find a

359
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,309
door that was unlocked

360
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:19,960
we going to the main building would be
where the library was going there and I

361
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,740
could read computer manuals

362
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,440
magazines read computer magazines and
very often in those magazines in the in

363
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,510
the late sixties

364
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,800
be a hard in the back you could fill in
with your name and address

365
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,070
send the card and they'd send your
computer manual in the mail

366
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,639
describing the architecture instructions
and everything

367
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,070
up that particular minicomputer first
many computers were human yet they were

368
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,399
just

369
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,400
rectangular boxes look like an airplane
cockpit that would scare anybody but

370
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,410
you know most of us in this room I'm not
be scared but its care most people

371
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:54,460
an intimidating but arm

372
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,020
became love my life finally a computer
gotten it is called the nolva

373
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,059
again I was getting very good at these
designs

374
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,030
when I get is every time I wanted to do
something for fun on my own

375
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,450
well I don't know I didn't go mentor
golfing usually in

376
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,520
didn't have a lot of other things to do
i sat down and design a computer again

377
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,350
how do you designed the same computer
over and over and over

378
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,760
you have to have a goal so my goal
became

379
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm gonna try to design it better than I
did before

380
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,080
use fewer chips use fewer wires

381
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,428
and I got to wear I dot extremely good

382
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:36,100
these designs to where I can design them
in half the number chips the company's

383
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,490
the bill to computers use

384
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,780
and that's what happens when you compete
with yourself the goal the reward is in

385
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,330
your own

386
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,490
you know you've accomplished something
three workers extrinsic where people can

387
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:46,950
see

388
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,350
you got a good salary at that suited the
title a job

389
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,600
you now press all the things I prestige
that people can see

390
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,290
no you just knowing you're hit you did
something you want to do when you did it

391
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,830
well

392
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,830
desert describe a lot of what we do here
course a quick second

393
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,639
designs data Journal Nova and took it
was a strange instructions sent fifty

394
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,360
instructions and have one instruction

395
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,340
and the one instruction broke 16 bits
into a truck to get a trumpet to get

396
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,459
into three different

397
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,720
one bit to bits and they all had me one
thought this is a very very strange

398
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,510
computer

399
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:25,390
it is so unlike the ones before and
after a few months ahead a free weekend

400
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,060
and sat down to design the data general
Nova

401
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,720
I found out that my instruction register
had 16 bits

402
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,890
and two wires went over to this chip for
selection and three wires went over that

403
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,530
chip to choose an operation and two for
another selection and and another one

404
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,170
more per carry and two for a shift I
said

405
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:47,170
oh my gosh I didn't have to put any
circuitry in Annette Bening smarts in

406
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,679
the design the computer match the chips
was a one-on-one perfection

407
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,500
and the design team after half as many
chips as all the other many computers

408
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,970
half as many chips a startling discovery
about

409
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:02,929
how to do things well so when we're
working very hard

410
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:07,020
something we want to achieve you know
crack some cold find a mistake find a

411
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,780
way to use it

412
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,370
very often we force ourselves with such
incredible

413
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,810
hard labor you no company could ever by
to come up with

414
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,730
with methods that are cleaner and pure

415
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,400
and better than existed before up doing
things in the world techniques

416
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,830
it off to the University of Colorado

417
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,100
my first year and I built a little TV
jam

418
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,210
little device in my hand but the fastest
transistor radio shack at nine volt

419
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:34,830
battery

420
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,678
acts I'd go over to there was the only
color TV was in the basement attic girls

421
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,169
storm

422
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,390
so everybody would go to there to watch
color TV I'd sit in the back rollin

423
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,250
school the Jamboree in with fuzz up the
picture a little

424
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,570
didn't quite quite blow away the the
color TV signal so the first time I ever

425
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,300
did this

426
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,040
my friend in the front row no planning
or anything

427
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,159
he knew I had a jammer black the TV and
the pitcher

428
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,270
me the picture perfect i sat there

429
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,480
you know kinda smirking for a little
while in the back its dark you know

430
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,590
as after a while I jammed again in my
friend he didn't want perfect

431
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,059
and got to the point that have to hit a
little harder

432
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,710
in different places to actually get the
F to get to work

433
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,309
one time he didn't hit somebody else
went up and started

434
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:27,230
this was like I shoulda got my degree in
psychology

435
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,679
a water

436
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,150
you know a lotta hacking is playing with
other people you know in getting to do

437
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,040
strange things

438
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,480
so i sat there for the next two weeks
and they would always station one person

439
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,290
to sentence chair by the TV

440
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,740
watching it backwards and that person's
job was to

441
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,700
fix it when it went bad and maybe he
would go up and tune the fine-tuning

442
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,140
remember the days when TV said fine
tuning

443
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,490
to in the fine-tuning perfect pulls hand
away goes bad

444
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,800
so I had fun playing with people's
bodies in

445
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,169
people are a lot better better um to
teach faster I think than rats are

446
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,320
from my experience

447
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,399
one of my most fun times there was one
time I noticed three people working on

448
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,630
the TV set

449
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,840
one of them had his hand on the middle
the screen we were watching mission

450
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,149
impossible

451
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,390
and his foot was up in the air on a
chair resting on a chair

452
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,830
so I made the picture perfect and
somebody said okay it's good now

453
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,570
so everybody relax and the picture went
bad when he took his hand off the screen

454
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,260
and somebody said women where your
body's remember your body's work

455
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,919
eventually he put his hand back on the
screen and it went good

456
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,320
and pulled it off and it went bad so
with his hand on the screen

457
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,550
he now put his foot down from the chair
onto the floor

458
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,110
and the picture went back any players
put back up on the chair and it went

459
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,950
good

460
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,950
and he turned around to the crowd any
announced it's a grounding affect

461
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,520
so we watched on the last half mission
impossible 1/2 hour

462
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,090
with him on the middle the TV screen

463
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,830
for real arm another time they said it's
an antenna problem

464
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,100
so they they are lifted the 2010 10 up
in the air in it fixed

465
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,040
you know and then after a while it went
bad selected little higher

466
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,340
and went bad so they found a chair stood
in the chair

467
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,740
I finally got it to where it would work
if the guy was up on his tiptoes

468
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,710
not if he came down on his heels

469
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,120
the and the only regret I ever had
playing all those little pranks on

470
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,950
people

471
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,100
you know like cool who would believe it
I never got caught once but

472
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,050
the only time I regret it was blanking
out the in the Kentucky Derby

473
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,600
all of a sudden what you think we're
normal college students

474
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,850
became animals they started get chairs
and lacking that TV interests they went

475
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,010
nuts

476
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:58,929
and that scared me that one I when I
would never want to confess to

477
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:02,039
so I love technology love computers I
took my first

478
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,999
computer course at the mercy Colorado
computer classes

479
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,259
work for undergraduates back then only a
very few schools

480
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:12,350
but I was an engineering student so I
was allowed to take

481
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,419
even graduate courses and I took my
first computer class very good class

482
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:21,059
talking about compilers operating
systems and and input/output devices and

483
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:22,080
languages and

484
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,658
everything credible lucky course and I
got an A plus in the course

485
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:29,879
I got put on probation for computer
abuse

486
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:35,669
actually the call to compute abuse a
computer time but turns out that I i

487
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:39,769
I was on my computer and I could finally
program and I love to program so much

488
00:27:39,769 --> 00:27:43,989
I thought I'm gonna write every program
I can in the world underwrite program a

489
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:47,399
program a program in that was my life
that was all I wanted to do

490
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,230
what to computers do they calculate
numbers where numbers

491
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,909
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics so I
looked up a buncha tables you know the

492
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,710
Fibonacci numbers the powers up to

493
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,559
inverse power to our wrote seven
programs that would Catholic tables

494
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,489
numbers I run seven programs and get
seven sets about puts have sixty pages

495
00:28:05,489 --> 00:28:09,389
and seven sets a punch cards to step
back in my death so it would pick up on

496
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:10,570
page 61

497
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,049
the next 60 pages the next time and I
would run seven programs times three

498
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:15,350
times a day time sixty-page

499
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,080
piling up reams and reams output on my
in my dorm room

500
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,158
dormant accounts small and I was just so
proud of this and the next stop

501
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,840
my programs from running I had to go
visit the professor he turned on a

502
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,200
tape recorder talk like I was out to get
him

503
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,230
we mean student and I'm running programs

504
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,289
this is mark last I said it's for tram
fortran class it's not our fortran

505
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:43,379
he called the computer department from
me turned on I run the budget five times

506
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:43,809
over

507
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,600
I didn't know they had budgets I thought
you're a student you run computer

508
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,359
programs

509
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,428
so I got wrapped up in this budget is in
the professor said

510
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:56,239
mister wozniak should pay it this was
more than tuition

511
00:28:56,239 --> 00:29:00,019
at the second most expensive our state
university in the country so

512
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:03,999
I did my passion about that one didn't
want to try and go back to that school

513
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:04,820
but actually

514
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,908
the professor was getting out of pain
but I

515
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:10,940
they wouldn't really ever built me but I
was scared and thought they were so the

516
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,169
next year I went to the inter college in
Cupertino

517
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:16,230
and frame I still want to program
computers

518
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,399
I took courses that would even carry
transfer credit to Berkeley

519
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,539
I just took courses on computers cuz I
love didn't want to write better

520
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:24,369
programs than anyone else in the class

521
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:28,519
I did really well at that a friend of
mine came to me and said that he had a

522
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,109
key to the computer room

523
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:35,480
that he had made a copy of so we would
go down the campus at midnight

524
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,309
unlock the doors larry woods he didn't
program really but it would start up the

525
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:41,789
computer terminals and we put a

526
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:45,340
P supply paper on the terminal so
wouldn't leave a record for the school

527
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,720
it was an IBM 360 40 in turn on the disk
drives and turn on the printers

528
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,799
is holding the stuff comes on and I was
for run programs

529
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,379
cards through you know till two three
four in the morning sometimes

530
00:29:56,379 --> 00:30:00,309
and it was just one of those things you
do gotta be in your computer

531
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:04,299
no matter what I don't know we didn't
hurt anyone I don't know what we cost

532
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:07,509
arm but you know

533
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:11,100
its you kinda have you know the real
solution was

534
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,220
was this curiosity how does the world
work just like that baby

535
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:20,109
arm atomic up to Berkeley I had a great
year I program computers for years work

536
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:24,730
earn money for Berkeley and now I got to
go to school with a car for my third

537
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,840
year college that was great to have a
car

538
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,909
be the one drive everybody 31 on the
weekends to buy

539
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:36,909
firecrackers I get some good stories
another

540
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,029
arm well pretty pretty much

541
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:42,820
pretty much it was funny at the end of
the year to go up and down a hallway

542
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,220
into

543
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,869
for burn marks for the most part they
never caught me for fireworks at school

544
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:48,359
but

545
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:52,779
one time a guy up on the fourth floor
above my room 31 out and

546
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:56,450
and throughout the wind up above and he
got caught so that

547
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,980
the price on all you're coming from him
it's like back

548
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,359
back in high school a little many with
the delayed fuse a cigarette or

549
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,249
something in a trash can

550
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:09,960
out the Quan it blew up oh man the next
day they were all upset the shop the

551
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,470
student walking every the student

552
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,909
room for lunch in another guy set of

553
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:19,220
firecracker that day in the same trash
can on the he got caught

554
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,919
that was the first time I'm I never
thought

555
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,690
if your gonna play a prank or something
it's better if it looks like someone

556
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,169
else did it

557
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:31,389
saying one else ever do that I would

558
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,879
no no a

559
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:38,749
so we learn things different ways so
anyway arm

560
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:41,940
actually back at University Colorado
with my TV jammer

561
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,700
adult love them into a magic marker real
well disguised

562
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,029
and slid into the Rings have a little
binder was taking notes and

563
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:52,629
started class I was in class had for TV
sets

564
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:56,039
only some upper-class students got to
watch the professor live

565
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,529
so I'm in there with the four TV sets
think to see if this jam it works for

566
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:01,559
fun and jammin jammin

567
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,279
I jammed the TVs and they didn't really
jamboree well cuz im a closed-circuit

568
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,279
the TV right near me didn't really get
jammed at all the TV across the room got

569
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,529
jammed the worst in different levels

570
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:15,740
all the sudden 3 older lookin students
stood up in the front a class

571
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,070
and they started looking it over very
small class

572
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,700
and I was scared they said whoever's got
the transmitter on turn it off

573
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,330
you're right I'm gonna reach down to my
magic marker lick it off

574
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:29,399
so on sittin there kinda scare through
the whole class they're watching us

575
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,570
closely in traffic

576
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,529
who's got my finger at the end the class
we walked out I'm safe

577
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:38,570
near the end of class there was a guy
sitting under the TV that was jammed

578
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:43,189
the worst and start gathering his books
up to leave a little early

579
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,629
so as he walked towards the door I
started twisting

580
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:50,809
the picture in and out in and out you
know last summer's

581
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:54,158
lesson worst as he walked out the door
medical perfect

582
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,749
I saw one of those t a guys point like
this

583
00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:00,789
and later I was telling the joke to a
few friends on those friends that he was

584
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:04,369
near the front row in the TA said their
egos

585
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:10,980
its thank you

586
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,960
it some another story like

587
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,049
macon somebody else look like they did
it sort berkeley

588
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:21,230
I wound up with Incredibles schedule I
was a junior I took for

589
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,630
I'm graduate level computer courses
because that's what interested me

590
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,870
what the first quarter and they were all
locally in the same room

591
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,679
up the same building and two more

592
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,140
on Tuesday Thursday to monday wednesday
as classes will be

593
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,590
and they were all one right after the
other so I could go into this classroom

594
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,960
sit down and 1c and go through two
classes in the same see

595
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,130
each day I even had the same seasons in
classroom ever

596
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,700
on the Monday 16 and the cheesy
Thursday's and none of my classes

597
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,260
started before new

598
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,650
so I hope that was an agreeable schedule
anybody in the world

599
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,789
and their kind of got in the blue boxes

600
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:03,480
two days before going to Berkeley on on
a Saturday at picked up a copy of I

601
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,500
never read Esquire magazine but there
was on my parents table

602
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,659
I picked it up and read the story the
secrets little blue box

603
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:14,950
fiction by Ron Rosenbaum and I read this
thing I was only

604
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:19,250
halfway through this incredible story
engineers smart people like myself

605
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,510
hooking up liars and requiring the
networks of the funk

606
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,129
the the phone network america I'm being
smarter than all the engineers in the

607
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:26,989
phone companies

608
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,470
and going around doing this stuff just
because they were wild crazy guys

609
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:34,159
and this is just an amazing amazing
story so half with recalled my best

610
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,290
friend Steve Jobs

611
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:39,199
and I started reading in parts of the
story special captain

612
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,220
Sky Captain Crunch is sort of boasted
about what he can do

613
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,419
but sources in that it doesn't do it
because he knows he's been tapped

614
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,299
you don't want to say model knows I
don't do that anymore but I could

615
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,730
and Tom I said not everything I said to
Stevenson

616
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,960
this article dozens reads like fiction
just reads

617
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,980
to true as many apps this room know that
article was a hundred percent

618
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,030
true the closest image to exactly what
the people said what they were like

619
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,619
but it was called section Steve Jobs I
haven't

620
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:16,190
lemma how do we know it's true or not is
a $1,700 900 hurts and to you know 702

621
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:19,950
in like manner whatever you know are
these the right ones a given a few

622
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,060
examples so we went down the slack

623
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,560
the next day Sunday nothin and it was we
got him

624
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,020
we started going through all the books
in the library and finally I was holding

625
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,290
on

626
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,970
Blue Book CC ITT and there was a list

627
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,310
numbers and frequencies and the ones
that were in the esquire article

628
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:40,430
matched exact they had even changed the
frequencies

629
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,609
Stephen I looked at each other and we
sort of knew that this whole thing

630
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:44,609
called phone freaking

631
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,890
wasn't fiction it was real and we rushed
home in

632
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,640
quickly that day bill Cup loss leaders
didn't quite get enough quality to

633
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,970
succeed with a phone call

634
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,200
we we believe in telling our parents
what we get they just said don't use our

635
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,800
phones

636
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,930
softly and and they were true that

637
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:07,930
i havent rough loss if either if I
believe something was somehow justified

638
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,570
right enough for me to do I could tell
my parents and good kept me from doing

639
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,720
some really bad things

640
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,050
but I figured evens blue box area if I
actually didn't got caught I was young

641
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:20,470
enough

642
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,170
to get my wrist slapped and that was a
one time my life I'd really be able to

643
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,080
do something like this

644
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,140
if it was real well by an oddly enough
by the time we actually finally got a

645
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,580
first look

646
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,950
box call to work from Steve's house we
we

647
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:35,630
immediately drove out to Berkeley and
never made another call from our own

648
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,160
houses

649
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,410
we better parents rule so

650
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,540
you know they were willing to let us
have some of our fun and explore

651
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,869
these new things we were into as long as
we can quite do it

652
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:52,460
you know in a way that would into them
well

653
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,030
after a while on I just felt this blue
box I'll get into

654
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,300
we nashnamie the unknown Captain Crunch
back them

655
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,080
which is very lucky but after Steve Jobs
came in he said let's Salam

656
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,339
everything I ever invented my life he
come and say let's sell

657
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:13,339
first this there's a few examples about
there's a few examples are there

658
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,890
and it was it was funny because we would
actually solve them door-to-door in the

659
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,868
dorms how to use onboard dormant don't
dorms if it's illegal

660
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:31,589
knock on the doors John Franks their
hootie guy that had makes the free phone

661
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:32,070
calls

662
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,400
don't know you start to scope the
Coyotes he call or not and then you can

663
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,480
pull some now your pocket one of these
things

664
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,760
this all taxable bonds what about those
and you say well

665
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,440
get everybody you know know somebody in
another country down your seven tonight

666
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,339
which often amplified speakers and tape
recorders and take the whole thing and

667
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,339
I was very shy but for an hour and a
half I was

668
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:54,650
master of ceremonies explain all the
famous phone for exams

669
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,960
stories and what they could do with how
amazing it was in the flaws in the phone

670
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,350
system then we start making

671
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,710
calls around the world in your call the
phone in the next room over you talk in

672
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,030
one form here the second later

673
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,100
all these great great amazing amazing
things

674
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,839
but it really gave me like the first
time in my life I was on stage

675
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,770
arm so we had a lot of fun doing that
one time we tried to sell one to some

676
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,230
guys in a pizza parlor

677
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:22,310
and 3 like Target ministration in the
back but they didn't have the money to

678
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,250
pay for

679
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,990
so we went up to our car gardening and

680
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:31,100
this guy came over and pointed a gun
right in the heart steve Jobs

681
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,600
he wanna the blue box so he got the blue
box real quick

682
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:43,480
however he didn't know how to use it so
he gave us a phone number

683
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,339
we weren't super smart phone numbers
back then but now we had a number and

684
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:46,750
scale

685
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,830
usually we could call that number
somebody would say call another number

686
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,069
to pay phone

687
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:56,160
and we talk to this guy charles and he
just want to pay a someday

688
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,180
could we meet him somewhere and give him
instructions on how to use it

689
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,339
so I was 20 in with one approach telling
them

690
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:06,920
instead of starting out with 800 number
start with an 80 way

691
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,400
you know so we get billed for every call
or

692
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,109
may be telling them away that we getting
busted for sure you know use a 555

693
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:15,400
number

694
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:20,030
but we never we never went that far what
we were doing all the stuff in reading

695
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,560
articles about people like Captain
Crunch

696
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,580
used whistle got me name Steve said he
heard the

697
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,549
your view on a station in the in around
the San Jose area

698
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,710
and we tried to go through that station
didn't get a whole the John Draper

699
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,800
didn't know his name FBI I didn't know
his name think

700
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,310
so them a guy came by my dorm room one
day from high school he said

701
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,650
I start on all the fun stories he said I

sec he dropped out right after the

705
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,660
esquire article

706
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,680

707
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,819

713
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,279

and drive it back up to Berkeley and it

736
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:38,039

we said well you know what crunch was
gonna come back this way in his van

738
00:41:42,179 --> 00:41:43,640
maybe he can give us a ride

739
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,098
so let's get to a pay phone with walk to
a pay phone at a gas station

740
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,609

never done it from a pay phone but

741
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,909
John give us a little advice that make
the pizza parlor and we made a Steve

742
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:56,569
Jobs makes the call on the blue box

743
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:59,829
and the operator comes on the line and
he hangs up all scared

744
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:04,569
copper came on the line whoa so we said
let's try it again we tried it again

745
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:07,569
the opportunity on the line we got so
scared put quarters im

746
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:11,788
and cop car pulled up cop pulls up

747
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:14,809
and we have long hair back then so the
cop walk past me

748
00:42:14,809 --> 00:42:19,619
and shone his flashlight into the bushes
his back was trying to mix a steep drop

749
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,029
shaking hand pass me the blue box and

750
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:27,259
I had a coat on so I got my pocket then
the cops turn back around

751
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:30,929
me searches may find this thing in my
pocket with the

752
00:42:30,929 --> 00:42:35,329
keypad and costs and what is it myself
some electronic music synthesizer

753
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:39,079
make stones I played a couple notes not
enough that he would know it wasn't

754
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:39,639
music

755
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:44,009
but on this cop

756
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:47,599
I'm you know he's holding a blue boxes
what's the orange button for and Steve

757
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,099
Jobs

758
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,559
that's for calibration the cops you know
you know

759
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,479
thus our stories second call came up cop
took the blue box first thing he says

760
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:57,689
what's this message its electronic
music's

761
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:01,719
synthesizer make music electronically
and those wings were

762
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:05,089
on her to back them I mean the Moog
synthesizer it just come out

763
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:08,288
you don't get something is what you want
but before Steve Jobs is for

764
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:11,689
calibrations computer-controlled in
public since his words computer plug in

765
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:16,279
she says oh that's inside you know these
cops we knew we were caught so

766
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:20,419
you know that's how it is so we get the
cops and what's happened within our car

767
00:43:20,419 --> 00:43:24,098
broke down and the possible take out to
it so we got in the car car the whole in

768
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:25,319
the blue box in the front seat

769
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,919
his cock turnaround passed it back to me
in the back seat

770
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:35,919
and he said well guy in the mood beat
you to it

771
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,530
sometimes you can't write a story as
what really happens

772
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,980
that was the night Captain Crunch course
I finally got home right withdrawn

773
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,589
Draper

774
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:51,700
and I drove back to Berkeley in about
three or four in the morning

775
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,930
fell asleep totaled my car no collision
insurance lost my whole car everything

776
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:00,009
am walked into the dorm room at berkeley
in a walk an hour and a half from

777
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,480
Oakland walked into my room at 7:30 in
the morning

778
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,400
I said good thing I didn't pay the $25
dollar parking fee this quarter

779
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,520
me my sis got a joke about

780
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,230
anything in the world matter how bad are
hard it is as of men told yes I did

781
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,540
actually place a call to the pope

782
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,950
ones from the blue box in the dorms one
of these tape recorded demos

783
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,530
and so little box next day and as john
draper likes to say

784
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,280
I was calling the pope to make a
confession well

785
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,589
eventually I wound up with an incredible

786
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:36,250
job without a degree yet working for
Hewlett Packard I took the next year off

787
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,810
to work

788
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:40,950
earn money for my fourth year college
and I got a job at Hewlett Packard

789
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,240
designing calculators

790
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,700
the Hewlett Packard scientific
calculator HP 35a come out

791
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,990
it was the most incredible product in
the world engineers

792
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,480
it was gonna change life forever for us
and how could you ever look into a job

793
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,260
designing them

794
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,070
even though I worked all day long design
look packard when I came home

795
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,369
I didn't want to get away from
electronics I want to keep doing it I

796
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:03,790
want to keep doing fun things

797
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,859
said lots outside projects probably the
one I'm most proud of

798
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:11,869
inadvertent some some media interviewed
me the other day what are you most proud

799
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:12,810
of in your life

800
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:17,529
and I'm really sad it's this I started
the first dial a joke in the Bay Area

801
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:20,680
I'd had a year a blue box in at berkeley

802
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,250
I had learned about Thailand rocks
around the world we never had one in the

803
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:24,869
Bay Area

804
00:45:24,869 --> 00:45:28,200
I wanted to start a dial a joke sounds
easy

805
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,349
you couldn't buy an answering machine
right you couldn't buy a telephone

806
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:32,990
backed them

807
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,290
1971 1972 an

808
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:40,080
so how do you do it it's pretty
expensive

809
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,509
I just want to nobody else had ever done
in the San Francisco Bay Area

810
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:47,380
you you may be made a lot of people in
your life that started companies

811
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,010
right but you've only met one probably
started the first I'll a joke ever

812
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,359
in a regional area this is by the wrong
crowd to say I'm

813
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,390
I'm the only one anyway I'm had to rent
a very expensive machine from the phone

814
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,098
company

815
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:04,119
it broke down the tape ran out from so
much use

816
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:07,150
ran out after a month and I was being
replaced with a new machine

817
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,790
so I was get my money's worth by having
renner high-price

818
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,109
and it was kinda cool because it was a
little bit like

819
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:18,029
chat rooms were eventually to be on the
internet I could get tons of calls

820
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,960
coming to answer machine all day and
after work I could come home and take

821
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,050
wife calls law you for dialing dialing

822
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:29,430
joke today's polish jokes he's and i
would tell a joke

823
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,868
quickly for dialing dialing Joe can hang
up

824
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:36,050
matter fact in my blue box days I liked
humor so much

825
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:39,760
I had built one special but my blue box
that we go

826
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,660
dddddd automatically dial a call one
call and it dialed happy been in Los

827
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,368
Angeles

828
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:50,640
anyone remember happy them is this old
guy singing happy days are here again

829
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,580
that was my favorite so now I have mount
alger I could come home and take

830
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,549
live calls and when I took my POS I was
had books have been sold by me so I can

831
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,030
always

832
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,430
beat the kids even though I was older
they would normally beat me with with

833
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,480
ability to talk and communicate come up
with clever ideas

834
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,160
not if I had books in from me so I

835
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,460
click notes on all the schools in the
area and if somebody called from

836
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,780
Oak Ridge High School Lites a yeah you
notice mister wilson still have those

837
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,440
big glasses he wears you know im they
fine you everybody in that area

838
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,050
it was fun to do you know it's fun to do
just lying on my mattress on the floor

839
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,109
my apartment

840
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:31,390
arm but I also got involved in other
projects in those days

841
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,580
like the first hotel movie systems I saw

842
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,369
pawn game once in a bowling alley in
said oh my god I can actually

843
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:43,050
built this I know television circuits
from high school and I know digital

844
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:43,589
design

845
00:47:43,589 --> 00:47:47,029
and so I built a very low chip count
Palm device for my house

846
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,369
in those days it was hard to come up and
build something it wasn't really

847
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:51,050
possible

848
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,990
TV's did not have video in but every TV
set in those old days came with a

849
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,730
schematic

850
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:00,560
you imagine it's almost like every
program today coming the source code

851
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,490
every TV had a schematic so you could go
figure out where to tap a video signal

852
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,760
in what little transistor interface to
make to make it right

853
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,310
and send your video in your home TV I
couldn't afford any input output

854
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,369
terminals

855
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:17,319
couldn't afford a teletype everyone has
a television for free

856
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:20,960
so that was some really the only
solution for me and

857
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,099
I come upon them it was pretty good
night another

858
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:28,589
like home pinball games and the fun
things you can make with electronics

859
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:34,980
earliest PCR always early as consumer
VCR

860
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,460
lot of people might say it was Sony
Betamax but there was one before Betamax

861
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:43,109
it was from the United States

862
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:47,609
nope heart revision you what probably
not many people know about it they had a

863
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:50,830
the a huge PC board that was the
spitting motor itself

864
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,880
was the park's were on the PC board

865
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,130
on and it was a big deal scam deal but

866
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,569
yet carter's shock to me in the company
went bankrupt right away and they were

867
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:00,819
like

868
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,650
8,000 these units available for 60 bucks
each so we Hewlett Packard engineered

869
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,260
would go down by Orman look at this
command to figure him out make them work

870
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:08,940
them

871
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,260
and are they actually work color VCRs
for 60 bucks in nineteen

872
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,770
7 the four ish

873
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,960
arm pretty amazing so I was so select
rocks were so much a part of my life

874
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,800
inside the company feel packard outside
the company one time when I was taking

875
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,359
jokes on dial a joke

876
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,089
I actually met I was kinda want those
guys never quite really be able to

877
00:49:31,089 --> 00:49:34,200
meet a girl the right way never have a
girlfriend I'm into

878
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,240
I met somebody on dial a joke was kinda
anonymous and wound up mariner

879
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,770
so I got my site my first wife there

880
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,530
so I'm very thankful for those are
things eventually

881
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,920
I couldn't make any money I couldn't
afford it so I said all these two

882
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,280
thousand people a day are calling when I
asked him for money

883
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,420
post office box 67 Cupertino Calif

884
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,410
and these kids send in money lots of
them but nobody even send

885
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,560
dollar bill except once and so in three
months I got eleven dollars

886
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,779
corns that was all so sad I finally had
to stop

887
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,650
eligio as I ran it humor changes
throughout time

888
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:16,319
what's good what's allowed what's okay
we didn't have political correctness you

889
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,730
but I told polish jokes well there are
polish societies the Polish American

890
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,300
Congress incorporated is

891
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,140
company and they support Polish people

892
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,930
twelve years later course I was to get
their highest distinction their heritage

893
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,000
awards but

894
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,050
at this point in time I was at this
point I'm the popular jobs the United

895
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,450
States were polish jokes

896
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:38,760
I was tellin so they threaten me with a
lawsuit defer defer

897
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,109
to for I'm maligning people a Polish
descent

898
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,310
oh my gosh I thought and polish this a
joke to the Sun

899
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:52,040
we're not putting we're not serious so
I'm gonna meet a joke that there's a

900
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,960
the Polish American Congress
Incorporated's doesn't like our jokes

901
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,580
you know you know polish jokes why don't
you call up call them up and tell them

902
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,839
what they're full of

903
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,790
well I again the phone number so

904
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,390
that might have amounted to thousands
the calls anyway the next letter from

905
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:10,150
their lawyer

906
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:14,760
accuse me of malicious an obscene phone
call so I guess those kids didn't quite

907
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,010
understand what I meant

908
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,060
just I meant to just one that they're
funny like them

909
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:23,080
site I talk to the lawyer and I said the
president I said what if I change the

910
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,750
jokes to Italian jokes

911
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:29,900
and he said that's mine

912
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,200
this is before political practice and
the whole idea was a joke

913
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,530
makes a person look bad right a
different

914
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,680
a certain class of people get your
stereotype

915
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,109
well told the joke at the University
Colorado engineering graduation once

916
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:45,180
that was an example of

917
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,830
what you know is it's hard even tell the
joke was

918
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:53,250
what do you call for Mexicans in
quicksand

919
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,470
Quatro Cinco

920
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,180
to play on words it's a cute little play
on words

921
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:04,400
my offended so many people that night
arm

922
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,170
seriously I did I got really horrible
thing said to me

923
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:12,870
so you know I don't know

924
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:16,250
to me how do you measure life happiness
equals smiles

925
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,570
Minas frowns maybe well

926
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,730
I eventually eventually

927
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:28,730
I got a call or something from for an
old friend John Draper I liked

928
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,750
to go visit John every few months he was
in a close friend

929
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,900
he was a little strange but he had

930
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,830
great stories up if you tap the hooks
which at this exact time between

931
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:42,650
the to click at the three click section
you can somehow get the operator come on

932
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,450
get free calls

933
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:47,070
he had method after method after method
if you go to this one pay phone in Los

934
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:47,870
Altos after

935
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:52,089
6 p.m. at night instead of calling 611
it puts on a machine that starts

936
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:52,700
clicking out

937
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,160
298 something to San Jose number for
telephone repair

938
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,759
but you can start to happen at your own
New York number instead from a little

939
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,440
machine from

940
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,740
he all these amazing things once told me
a coat

941
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,640
tapping the phone lines called tapped
into the FBI

942
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,690
and this the one time ever and I heard
them talking about some sensitive

943
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,720
picking up some suspect issues I was
just blown away

944
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:19,380
john told me that one time when he did
it the FBI saugerties

945
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,670
very week beeps every 15 seconds you can
almost not your

946
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:26,320
one time they heard and they said almost
be the guys downstairs taping us again

947
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:32,710
the suspected their own people so

948
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,870
the Apple ones to come to the world but
them

949
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:38,940
eventually I went over to John Drapers
basement where he was working on a

950
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,920
project on phones in Cupertino

951
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,010
and he was so excited he said you can
see the stephen biko's order

952
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:48,570
teletype machine that I could never even
afford annex type devices

953
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,540
I am playing chess with the computer in
Boston this is what I can switch over to

954
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,200
Stamford

955
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,090
ACA switch up to Berkeley insists Santa
Barbara he could switch to all these

956
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:58,130
computers around

957
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:01,600
it was the early ARPANET this was
amazing it was like

958
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,300
phone like ham radio could reach out to
people for across the country

959
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,320
blue boxes could reach out to people for
across the country in world

960
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,720
now here was a computer network that
reached out across the world

961
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,390
it's those kinda things always intrigued
me I got pulled into it I said

962
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,240
oh my god I have to do this how do you
do it

963
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,320
when you can't afford equipment I mean I
have to pay cash

964
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,560
my parton's my checks bounced well well

965
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,730
I knew how to design a pawn game put
spawn on TV screen so

966
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:36,890
I just designed to put letters on my TV
screen and be a terminal

967
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:40,120
and what you need you need a keyboard to
be human

968
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,130
keyboards back then were like quick on a
thousand bucks today

969
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:46,650
by found one keyboard in a magazine for
sixty dollars

970
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:51,710
uppercase only sixty dollars that was
the most expensive thing I purchased on

971
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,160
the road to Apple success

972
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,560
bought that I'm Hewlett Packard had a
very much policy

973
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,330
written down tracks you got to see which
was if you used

974
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,279
you could use chips out the schoolroom
for projects your own design

975
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,030
if your supervisor approved so I had
access to chips

976
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:13,360
and this keyboard for 60 bucks made the
whole thing called

977
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:16,420
in a fixture got my terminal working
built

978
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,000
adult a modem and I could calls call a
number at Stanford

979
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,030
and I could talk to all these computers
almost never did it there wasn't really

980
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,820
anything I want to use the computers for

981
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,840
but it was neat to have been able to do
it it was just from a hacking spirit

982
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,920
telling other people

983
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,090
on an incredible amazing thing you can
do you'd never

984
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:38,300
almost anybody in the world would even
know about i think is possible and

985
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,740
them a friend called up any said Steve

986
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,360
club is starting up and it's for people
who build

987
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,030
terminals and things and it was very
lucky that Allen said that because

988
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,690
if you'd said it's a microprocessor club
I would said I'm not going I don't know

989
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,080
anything about microprocessors

990
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,100
I'd really drop my computer and stuff
since

991
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,000
working packard but it's it's for people
with terminals and I thought well

992
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,380
if I go with something I've done I built
a terminal I can always

993
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,220
like communicate cuz I can talk about
what I've done easier than

994
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,410
anything else I went to this meeting I
was shocked

995
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,339
they're all talking about
microprocessors little computers with

996
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,070
faceplates

997
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:19,740
like airplane cockpits and pictures in
magazines and people have gone to the

998
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,420
company's

999
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,690
everybody's gonna build as
microprocessors and I'm shocked

1000
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,930
really da morning it was a terminal were
coming on TV

1001
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,350
not pass up schematic steny buddy wanna
but arm

1002
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,880
to accommodate a sheet for what a
microprocessor was and stone

1003
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,410
myself this microprocessor is just like
the many computers I design back in high

1004
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:39,190
school

1005
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,370
on my god it's the same thing it's on a
chip

1006
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,930
when I was at the in the high school I
told my dad I'm gonna Sunday

1007
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,280
my life I'm gonna have of 4k Nova

1008
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,630
because it can run for trent for kicking
14 I'm here for Cain opening said Steve

1009
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:58,000
cost as much as in part as a house I
said well on the live in the park

1010
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,340
someday I'm gonna have a minicomputer
now I realize what is microprocessors

1011
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:06,570
I was actually the people for a real
computer my own design maybe

1012
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,940
and started thinking that way didn't
have enough money to buy anything right

1013
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,870
away

1014
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:14,200
microprocessor 400 bucks way too
expensive

1015
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,520
Hewlett Packard microprocessor 40 bucks
from as as an employee

1016
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,650
that was gonna be my road design on
paper

1017
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,360
drafted into my drafting board a company
introduced the best newest

1018
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,780
microprocessor for twenty dollars

1019
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:31,010
not only that but instead of having to
go to a distributor and flock

1020
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,310
credit reports like your company you
know what a lot of us just want to be

1021
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:37,299
normal human beans I wanna be a company

1022
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,590
instead of the one of these weird things
your company you just go on paying 20

1023
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,900
bucks a show in San Francisco called
West on

1024
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,920
and they give you a microprocessor chip
oh man I want bought a few chips

1025
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,400
so did a lot other people in our
Homebrew Computer Club and

1026
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,070
got to work and start designing computer
eventually got to work

1027
00:57:56,070 --> 00:58:00,670
got some really took me some good
choices among for dynamic Rams

1028
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:04,010
the sky the 4k dynamic RAM for gonna be
the first RAM ever to be cheaper than

1029
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:04,810
core memory

1030
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:09,420
and change the change computer memories
forever but everybody was designing the

1031
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,460
infantile computers back then they were
simple hobbyist worked at home

1032
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,340
and they were designing with static Rams
because you can take the after spin for

1033
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,500
microprocessor

1034
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:22,580
and connect a wire to the address can
have a chip the date of a microprocessor

1035
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,319
to the data chips connect the wire

1036
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:29,170
and it works but those static lambs
we're gonna cost a lot more

1037
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:33,450
the dynamic grams and it was gonna take
a lot more of them to make a computer

1038
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:37,250
in fact it was it took thirty two chips
to get $4 K avram

1039
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,570
on static grams but these new dynamic
grams the new 4k dynamic Rams

1040
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:45,190
you could do it with a chips a chips
instead a 32

1041
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,560
my goal always to compete with myself
into things and fewer chips

1042
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,779
had to go that way so I could be smart
enough to design the refreshing

1043
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,490
circuitry cuz these dynamic Rams

1044
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:59,870
forget their the contents after two
thousands of a second

1045
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,819
am that was a good decision so things
start looking ahead this

1046
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,630
Apple one computer finally build and
working and instead of having

1047
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,900
faceplate look like an airplane cockpit
had a keyboard

1048
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,200
look human and really it was suggested
morning thing else to me by two things

1049
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,550
I had built the face pic play computer I
got some chips and don't want

1050
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:22,440
five years before am I went to a packer

1051
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,550
are catholics human keyboard how does
human keyboard work

1052
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:30,170
a program run saying are you pressing a
key if you press the five key the

1053
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,030
programs as a key

1054
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:35,570
pressed I figure out if I P gonna run
the program to stick a 5-inch display

1055
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:38,570
I quit now go back and say is a key
being pressed

1056
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:42,290
source pack a company to set their
program watching for you press keys

1057
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:45,370
and it did with the key should do so I
wrote a grown little program I might

1058
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,799
for my keyboard I could now tight on
human keyboard

1059
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,050
ok and I was a good typist I can
actually take data into the computer

1060
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:56,090
so much faster than toggling Ubuntu
whites into the right one 001

1061
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,820
0111 0 address put push a button and
puts in the address register

1062
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:05,150
105 101 all 111 pop it in the data and

1063
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:08,240
was so miss so miserable dimensionals
other computers

1064
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,420
the other people getting popular about
in the hobby sphere

1065
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,870
want something that I could really use
and most of all you had to use for games
