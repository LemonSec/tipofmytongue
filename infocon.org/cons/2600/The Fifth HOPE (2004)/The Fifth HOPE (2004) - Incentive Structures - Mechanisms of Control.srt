1
00:00:00,679 --> 00:00:05,930
and game theory as hackers

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,360
it is our fundamental nature to take
control technology

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,329
not out in the sense that fear but as a
basic creative in polls

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,080
to take things apart figure out how they
work and explore their creative uses

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,430
and we've all heard that thousand times
but there is

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,259
much truth to it this drive is
effectively a force of nature

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,650
and I for one simply could not live in a
world where I couldn't take control

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,710
the technology in my life unfortunately

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,420
many influential entities have strong
incentives to take control

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,880
out of our hands for ever these entities
include political and economic elites

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,190
along with their subordinated
counterparts in the media by elites we

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,089
just mean people or organizations that
wield disproportionate power in a given

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,850
area relative to general populace

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,040
and we're concerned in this case with
people who have disproportionate

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,350
political power

16
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,109
and disproportionate economic power to
understand what these people want

17
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:09,538
and how they're going after it and also
how we can deal with them

18
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:13,369
it's good to look at their incentives or
their basic motives

19
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,979
to understand what these incentives are

20
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,139
we have to understand their people
behind these and Senate our world is

21
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:22,240
made up of people

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,029
so I'm going to start with the basic
overview it human incentives

23
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:29,789
and this may seem very reductionist and
in

24
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:36,279
human it's a somewhat common viewpoint
in economics to reduce people two sets a

25
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:41,048
equations describing their behavior well
you can't make very accurate predictions

26
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:42,450
on an individual level

27
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,719
when you do take people in aggregate
statistical averages across huge

28
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,789
populations

29
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,409
it does become relatively useful tool

30
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:56,459
for understanding a very complex problem
so incentive structures are not

31
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,709
inherently sinister

32
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:02,109
the challenges every society is to align
the interests of the individual

33
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:06,489
with the interests and that society in
general we do this fairly well

34
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:10,240
and it often doesn't matter what kind of
character you have because if you like

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,940
pleasure

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,640
and you dislike pain you'll follow most
of the rules most of the time

37
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,150
there are always loopholes but people it
basically good character

38
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,540
tend not to abuse them the problem is
that people in organizations who are

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,470
powerful

40
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:28,560
are powerful because they are good at
getting power

41
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,930
and good at keeping power people and
organizations who are rich

42
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,400
are good at getting money and good at
keeping money

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,570
in general anything that exists

44
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,170
exists because it is good existing
whether we are talking about living

45
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,200
organisms

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,700
or cosmic structures like stars and
planets it seems to be a mechanical fact

47
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,410
if nature

48
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,220
at least over the time frame some
observation the drive to exist is that

49
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,880
the basis of all motives and incentive
structures

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,940
whether we are talking about animals
human beings political systems

51
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,620
corporations religions cultures or
nations

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,620
if political powers corporations are
wealthy investors

53
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,480
have the opportunity to alter societies
incentive structures through legislation

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,870
to suit their interests at our expense
and they do not take it

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,230
they will be defeated and replaced by
political and corporate powers willing

56
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,000
to exploit

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,680
every opportunity consequently you can
guarantee

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,750
that any entity will first and foremost
lookout

59
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,940
after its own survival to the exclusion
up

60
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,630
everything else and this is true whether
you're talking about industrial

61
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,750
monopolists

62
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,100
government agencies were even National
Public Radio

63
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,940
in our case the situation is that too
entrenched group at the leets

64
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,970
the political and economic elites who
have successfully subordinated a third

65
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,350
group

66
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,950
elites the media are being threatened by
a new emerging elite

67
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,730
which they weren't prepared for because
it could never before have existed in

68
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,209
all human history

69
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:07,090
it was made possible a mere half century
ago by the military-industrial complex

70
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,040
and the peripheral technologies related
to developing the atom bomb

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,790
and understanding the dynamics that the
cold war that ensued

72
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,498
ultimately this new elite if it's even
fair to call it that

73
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:21,870
threatens the dominance in the
entrenched powers that be just as

74
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,909
emerging media threaten the dominance

75
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:29,188
the entrenched powers last century in
that case the entrenched powers one

76
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:32,990
new media were successfully coopted and
subordinated

77
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,729
in this case I think we'd like to see a
different outcome

78
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,360
that is the prospect they want to
discuss although it seems a bit

79
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,020
unrelated it's important to begin basic
human incentives

80
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,669
to understand what people want so we can
predict what they will do

81
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,990
in aggregate will start with a basic
human being and

82
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,449
follow its incentives from birth until
death because this basic trajectory

83
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,669
drives a great deal at the behavior that
we see from

84
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,460
our personal lives to our working lives
to politics and economics

85
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,498
and the seemingly blind force that
history so when a child pops into the

86
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:10,909
universe the first thing it has to do is
acquire resources from its parents

87
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:14,150
its top priority is to survive to
adulthood

88
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,289
so at first it cries when its needs
aren't met and this seems to work

89
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:21,300
of course a child must continue to
please its parents

90
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,659
in order to get things that likes like
food two ways

91
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:29,319
money clothing tuition a new car or the
family inheritance

92
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,900
early childhood is concerned with very
difficult subjects like language

93
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,389
acquisition

94
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,849
symbol grounding constructing some model
love

95
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:42,090
physical reality that represents
physical reality

96
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,020
but when a child reaches school things
get interesting

97
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,498
it certainly has to survive its teachers
and its peer group

98
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:52,659
the parents want one thing the peer
group wants another

99
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:56,990
and the teacher want something else kids
often tend to favor the peer group

100
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,479
and this can create conflict with the
parents at home

101
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,620
of course if a child has siblings this
is

102
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,779
much more complicated problem because
siblings will often full

103
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,719
bill some kinda role in the family might
have the brainy one or the strong wind

104
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:12,400
or the

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,699
athletic one or the tough one other clan
e1 N

106
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,830
this can happen in social peer group as
well

107
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,498
so quite often people will develop a
proto personality based around what

108
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,289
social roles are available

109
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:29,349
to them the real crisis hits when
children discover the opposite sex

110
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,460
and that's really the motor that drives
human behavior

111
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,029
Ste suddenly the struggle for power and

112
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:40,259
peer status becomes vicious posturing
takes over the entire personality

113
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,849
contorts to impress the opposite sex

114
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,099
and this full-time preoccupation less
straight through college

115
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:49,210
we're social life is often predicated on
access

116
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,360
to the opposite sex for most people

117
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,629
this never really goes away

118
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:58,680
the really difficult problem for the
individual

119
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,909
comes when one has to integrate into the
ecosystem or the

120
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:07,009
economic system which is usually after
high school or college

121
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,400
this is when all your hopes and dreams
and ambitions collapse into a message

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,339
futility

123
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:15,930
when everything you want in life turns
out to be completely inaccessible

124
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,939
you can't get what you want you can't
even get what you think you're entitled

125
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,479
to any never really had a shot

126
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,099
this dry salt a young man into rages
they fly off the beam try to change the

127
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,969
world start revolutions

128
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:32,119
joined rock bands or find religion and
enlist in the military

129
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,430
of course you've got to make sure it's
the right religion and the right

130
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,869
military or john ashcroft will come
after you

131
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:41,759
ultimately most people succumb to the
mating instinct

132
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,550
something clicks and they think such and
such a person is so wonderful nothing

133
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,979
else matters all I need is so and so and
sure enough they get married get

134
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:52,399
pregnant get a mortgage and become
completely dependent

135
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,059
on the status quo this turns many people
into reactionary conservatives

136
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,729
and basically wipes out many people life
over

137
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,258
they have to work very hard just to pay
for the basic needs of their offspring

138
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,740
their kids grow up and leave home they
have to pay for college often taking out

139
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,159
mortgages which they have to pay off
again

140
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,289
save for their retirement mending grow
old and retire which leaves them

141
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,639
very little opportunity to work for
active

142
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,249
social change and unfortunately that
seems to be a a basic human life

143
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:28,699
because if we didn't make that kind of
sacrifice for our children then there

144
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,199
wouldn't be

145
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,850
that many children to keep the species
going

146
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,020
there are ways to make this work if
you're clever about it

147
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,990
if you get married just the right time
and save wisely

148
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,380
but you have to have the right it
manages right from the start

149
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,770
and many people just end up trick by
nature Intelli dependency and mediocre

150
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,300
lives in suburbia

151
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,160
with two buicks and washing machine but
this is the trajectory that drives a

152
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,339
great deal with our political and
economic systems

153
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,310
when people talk about family family
values marriage marriage and family are

154
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,020
sacred institutions that's what they're
talking about

155
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,050
because these people are they have very
strong vested interests in these

156
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,590
institutions they've sacrificed a lot
for them

157
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,390
and they've worked so far as far as many
people are concerned

158
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,980
now as far as I can tell there seem to
be five major universal motives

159
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,170
and this is admittedly very reductionist

160
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,709
food sacks money social status

161
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,860
and meaning if you dangle any one of
these in front of people the whimper and

162
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,960
contort and prostrate themselves

163
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,030
violate their most sacred principles and
dance around like little imbeciles

164
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,720
and were wired to be this way our
motives are fairly obvious and

165
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,040
evolutionary grounds

166
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,610
meaning is a bit more speculative but
there seems to be a need for a feeling

167
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,700
of connectedness to something larger
than one cell

168
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,110
this is probably what religious leaders
refer to when they justify their

169
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,010
existence with talk to be

170
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:03,470
spiritual hunger often this manifests as
religious chauvinism

171
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,550
ethnocentrism nationalism racism

172
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,910
war and genocide in any event these

173
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,020
five major motives well we have to ask
where they come from

174
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,550
I expect their rise from what could be
called a genetic principal-agent

175
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,880
problem a principal-agent problem is a
problem in economics where the principal

176
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,800
or owner once one thing and the agent
which could be a manager

177
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,800
want something else this creates
conflicting interests

178
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,890
and it's very hard for the principle to
structure incentives to make the agent

179
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,120
act in the principles interest

180
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,600
in animals we could say that

181
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,770
jeans are the principles and we are the
agents

182
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,400
genes encode information about the
environment which is useful to their

183
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,950
reproductive success

184
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,720
jeans want you to perpetuate them but
you could have other ideas

185
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,970
so jeans attempt to you control you by
aligning your hedonistic sensations

186
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,040
with their reproductive interests things
that feel good

187
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,040
usually are good for your survival
prospects

188
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,829
like not getting too hot or too cold in
making sure you have enough to eat and

189
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,140
enough to drink

190
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,250
getting enough sleep them basic things
that people enjoy

191
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,830
tend to be good for them and there are
some exceptions

192
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,210
but one can think of jeans is trying to
learn the appropriate utility function

193
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,620
or a happiness metric foreign agent in
an environment

194
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,210
however genetic controls are easily
manipulated or circumvented

195
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,620
and it takes a very long time for genes
to encapsulate new environmental

196
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,560
information

197
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,420
so if the environment changes in ninety
logical time frames

198
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,459
you generally need something else too
deal with it

199
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,920
environmental information the changes
too quickly to be incurred a genetically

200
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,349
but not so fast that it requires real
time sensory input

201
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,970
can be transmitted through other means
religious cultural and family values

202
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,800
influence behavior by associating
artificial responses with certain

203
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,900
stimuli

204
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,280
to camp for things missed by genetic
encoding

205
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,829
for example the belief that hard work is
inherently virtuous and indulgence is

206
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,110
inherently bad

207
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,770
is a common value which has been
successful in the people who hold it

208
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,660
of course they don't know why the
believe these things

209
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,819
and the end result is that people are
fall I'll

210
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,460
believes that they hold vigorously

211
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,980
but they have no idea why they hold
these beliefs or where these beliefs

212
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,030
came from

213
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,360
so they start engaging in behaviors

214
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,830
they think they thought a but these
behaviors were really

215
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,700
programmed into them in many cases so to
make a metaphor to the computer we can

216
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,990
look at values as

217
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,190
code which influence behavior by
affecting one's

218
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:54,630
utility function our happiness metric or

219
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,990
hedonistic sensations and an almost
pavlovian manner

220
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,790
interactions between these distributed
values: for this distributed code

221
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,890
can manifest as what one could call
institutional

222
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,540
atomic to or computer programs
information processing and it is like

223
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,640
religions political systems are market
structures

224
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,730
that forge alliances and wage wars have
survival

225
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,970
with each other and you'll often see
this one religion aligning itself with

226
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,840
the given political model

227
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,040
more one culture aligning itself with a
certain religion aligning itself with

228
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,900
some

229
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,220
and economic believes and the like

230
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,990
the problem is once these social
institutions have manifested

231
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,370
they become independent the individuals
that constitute them

232
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,530
they want to survive at any cost and
will corrupt their values accordingly

233
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,829
and impose themselves by force
regardless if the decisions individuals

234
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,600
these are not means these are computer
programs

235
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,230
built from mediums or in keeping with
the genetic metaphor

236
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,560
DNA strings that regulate the expression
levels at their

237
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,450
various values in order to survive what
is interesting about

238
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,240
institutional automata is that they are
selected by evolution to thrive

239
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,480
in an environment of human incentives
all interactions with the

240
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,360
real-world are mediated through people
according to what they want and need

241
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,420
catastrophe occurs win the environment
changes rapidly

242
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,630
in this is usually do in our world to
technology

243
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,060
so rapidly that these institutions that

244
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,300
were once so successful in rational
start

245
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,680
inducing irrational behavior in

246
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,820
people

247
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,190
nothing is evolved to cope with modern
rates have change

248
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,370
but we can ask where our values come
from and whether they are really

249
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,460
appropriate

250
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,580
for a given environment the problem
years that well

251
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,600
values can be reassessed in changed
institutions which impose values

252
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,310
will struggle to survive no matter how
destructive those values are

253
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,360
these institutions can be religion but
quite

254
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,840
often dangerous ones are market hedge
funds whose business models are

255
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,490
ecological dominance

256
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,730
are threatened by a changing environment

257
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,990
the dominant species in the landscape
both human incentives has traditionally

258
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,540
been the political elite

259
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,750
who command the state and its police and
its military

260
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,670
in our world these people are often
organizations who wield political power

261
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,010
through legal means

262
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,360
often their political leaders lobbying
group or political powers

263
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,430
they have disproportionate power over
the state relative to everyone else

264
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,750
the state itself is a monopoly on
violence

265
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,570
it decides who gets what and like an old
high school teacher my knees to say

266
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,570
decides who gets what coming down the
barrel of a gun

267
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,770
without democracy a rulers and Senate is
to stay in power it

268
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,029
any cost and cereal monopolists and
dynasties

269
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:03,230
a ruler typically has a classic people
who exist to legitimize his rule

270
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,820
and justify the status quo these people
could be religious leaders

271
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:13,190
or economics professors elite's usually
cloak self-interest unveils a

272
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,350
religion and ideology now the big trip
with political elites

273
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:23,050
is that no political system can survive
if it cannot sacrifice people for its

274
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,050
interests

275
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,310
it must induce you to give up your life
to protect

276
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,710
yet so on architecture manufactured
loyalty

277
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,990
and consensual delusion is often
required

278
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,480
this involves collective mythology and
jingoism

279
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
as some people see through this stuff
and consequently get denounced for lack

280
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,279
of patriotism

281
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,939
which i think is stupid because
legitimate democracies

282
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,160
shouldn't need jingoism so I have to
wonder

283
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,130
about these jingoistic what really are
their attitudes towards democratic

284
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,570
traditions

285
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,190
the problem with political elites is
that they reap the benefits while the

286
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,870
people pay the costs

287
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,260
this asymmetry have incentives leads to
disaster

288
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,329
leaders will frequently play chicken
with the fates have their people in

289
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,770
situations such as globalization

290
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:16,000
sanctions or war despotism may have
worked on a small tribal level

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,069
it may even work in the computer game
Civilization

292
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,369
but it is a catastrophe on a larger
scale so democracy corrected this

293
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,630
problem

294
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,980
as an interesting aside from a
mathematical standpoint

295
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,210
no democratic system can consistently
expressed preferences

296
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,600
this is proved by Kenneth a row and I
think 1975

297
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,200
under fairly soft assumptions

298
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,910
so it turns out the designing the
optimal voting system is

299
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,500
completely impossible because he cannot
exist

300
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,700
american democracy was immaculately
architected in the face if this

301
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,820
mathematical impossibility

302
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,179
and it works very well in

303
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,250
the eyes of many people it is the crown
jewel the Enlightenment

304
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,670
there are difficulties as always and
respecting the rights of minorities

305
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,760
while expressing the will of the
majority

306
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,980
but our Constitution does seem to handle
this well

307
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,100
still as the authors of the federalist
papers made clear the threat of special

308
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,350
interests taking over government

309
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,610
is ever-present the special interests
that are always threatening to take over

310
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,190
our government tend to be market elites

311
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,870
individuals and organizations with
disproportionate economic power

312
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,000
at present the state is weaker then it
has ever been

313
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,950
post stature and post reagan this state
is destroyed

314
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,350
it has very little control over anything

315
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,850
the story that gets repeated

316
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,540
many introductory economics classes is
that once there was feudalism and

317
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,470
it was bad but we were saved because in
order to finance wars

318
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,020
monarchs granted increasing powers to
the merchant classes

319
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,170
until finally the merchant classes
pushed for rights have their own in this

320
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,750
ultimately brought the

321
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,070
blessings at the Liberty to rest of the
world

322
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:08,370
and that's somewhat correct what they
forget to mention is that soon enough

323
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,740
people lost control and the markets took
over

324
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,320
market mechanisms and their
institutional structures and markets

325
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,780
need

326
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,580
massive institutional support

327
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,309
and that's something that we have
learned watching the failures economic

328
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,070
transition in many countries

329
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,020
where we liberalized without giving a
thought to establishing

330
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,460
ru love law or legitimate democracy

331
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,200
or consistent rights for the freedom of
the press which is an absolute crisis in

332
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,580
russia right now

333
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,899
the mobs have taken over and it's going
to be

334
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:47,850
incredibly difficult to take that
country back

335
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,430
so in this regard they are like

336
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:55,090
cell reproducing computer programs in a
sense

337
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,330
you could run analogy to the machines in
the matrix in that were completely

338
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,090
dependent upon them

339
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,110
but they are out of our control so by a
self reproducing computer programmers

340
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,220
self reproducing automaton

341
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,200
we mean something that runs by itself
and can produce reasonable facsimiles

342
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,160
the selection mechanism is whether these
can maintain themselves in the presence

343
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,309
entropic forces in the environment which
is done

344
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,920
by responding appropriately to the
environmental stimuli

345
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,240
in essence are they good at existing

346
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,610
markets are particularly responsive to
real time environmental change

347
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,030
the computationally simple and in a
sense approximate numerical

348
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,740
representation

349
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,710
human wants needs and incentives markets
are adapted

350
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,350
to people all interactions are mediated
through

351
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,530
people all computational work is done by
people

352
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:54,030
but the market themselves and their
massive institutional support structures

353
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,460
form an environment or ecosystem which

354
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,490
also provides a nice home to a certain
invasive species

355
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,830
and this species would be the
corporation

356
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,889
or the firm which 10 the chase markets
across the planet

357
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,200
you could say like bacteria on rotting
flesh

358
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,870
market environments are highly dynamic
so

359
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:21,050
firms are of necessity extremely
responsive to their environment

360
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,270
and what is really bizarre is that
corporations are granted

361
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,500
legal status as human teens with

362
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,570
equal access to rights equal access to
the law

363
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,280
just like everybody else has

364
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,410
except they have limited liability

365
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,590
they're not held accountable for their
actions they have disproportionate

366
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,770
wealth

367
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,429
and disproportionate political
representation they can sue

368
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:52,170
anybody out of business whether they're

369
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,790
right in there soon or not they can

370
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,379
change the rules to put their
competitors out of business or to stop

371
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,460
competitors from

372
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,510
entering the market they are

373
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,280
sociopathic they have in mind to
dominate markets as a species might

374
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,110
an ecosystem and in that regard we can
draw an analogy to the AI's in the

375
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,950
matrix

376
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,679
in that they care only for their own
continued survival

377
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:21,990
market power itself comes from

378
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,030
among other places monopolistic

379
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,200
devices such as brands patents

380
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,360
copyrights control the distribution
channels

381
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,440
control its standards or asymmetric
competition

382
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,900
such as mobile capital verses

383
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:44,559
immobile labor a corporation a group of
corporations first invades ecosystem

384
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,300
then sets up barriers to exclude
competitors that's what people are

385
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,090
talking about when they say

386
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,250
well I had to drop out of college
because the

387
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,700
you know the window of opportunity in
that market was closing

388
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,990
that ecosystem was having barriers put
up around it to protect it from

389
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,860
competition

390
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,220
now affirm is evolve to survive or

391
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,410
crayon human incentives this is why
firms are immune to individual actions

392
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:15,300
they can always replace defectors if the
CEO decides one day he's

393
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,679
lived a bad likeness going to

394
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:22,679
stop with the United Fruit Company is
tired of killing people

395
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,830
he'll be replaced and that from a drama
a lot of money

396
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,879
to find someone out there and with close
to 300 million people in this country

397
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,080
you will find someone out there willing
to replace him

398
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,830
to maintain ecosystem dominance
monopolist will often

399
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,309
bribe political elites through campaign
contributions

400
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,330
the support love lobbying group the
support I've

401
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,760
think tanks and they often trade favors
with the media

402
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,410
through advertising public relations

403
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,960
stock offers which you might not be
aware of

404
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,270
and other special relationships very
often a group of corporations will agree

405
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,980
implicitly to share an ecosystem

406
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,799
this is not conspiracy it is simple
tit-for-tat

407
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,549
iterated game theory the golden rule it
happens

408
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:16,650
all the time in nature from birds
sharing the bugs in the ecosystem

409
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,690
to energy firms dividing up local
markets

410
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,440
Robert Axelrod did the groundbreaking
work in this showing that tit-for-tat

411
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,030
is a very stable strategy it's very easy
for people to learn this it's very easy

412
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,129
to understand when someone else's

413
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,710
doing tit-for-tat with you if you accept
a

414
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:39,860
an energy bid and some guys be a ten
million dollars and 2006

415
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,970
dollars at the end well that might

416
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:48,270
inspire you think maybe he wants to
offer me the 2006

417
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,059
area code 0 but the energy market and so
you might say okay I'll

418
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:56,720
you know beard de San I'll give you the
512

419
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,210
and in fact that that actually does
happen and it's a problem with people

420
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,929
who develop auctions to

421
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:05,220
stop corporations from embedding these

422
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,510
secretly a very difficult to prove

423
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:13,450
agreements to divide up markets

424
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,460
unfortunately the subservience at the
media

425
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,570
in olive this is a grotesque ace Tim
negligence to humanity

426
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,620
among everything else that happened last
century

427
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,780
new media technologies kept springing up
in threatening to inform the people

428
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,440
but every time a new medium would pop up
it would be systematically coopted

429
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,150
communists and fascists and especially
the nazis pioneered it as a control

430
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,020
mechanism

431
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,840
well western democracies excelled at
placating their own citizenry and

432
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,250
selling products

433
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,520
the patterns fairly clear poetry impress
in world war 1 cinnamon

434
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,150
radio in world war two and later Correa
TV in on cable news in desert spectacle

435
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,320
the internet and spectacle part 2

436
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,549
and every time afterwards the elites
learn to control these new media

437
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:04,389
probably right now the pentagon is
figuring out how to control the internet

438
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,440
just like it controls the newspapers

439
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,820
television networks and radio stations
in times of war

440
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,879
the failure ok media are too many to
enumerate

441
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,990
but to rather work some phenomena are
worth men

442
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,110
channing what I like to call the apathy

443
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:27,070
engines and the distraction engines
apathy engines tend to be PR firms and

444
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,879
media figures who propagate

445
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,900
apathy the often do this by producing

446
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,440
easy to remember one liners which allow
people to feel

447
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,480
empowered by defending the status quo

448
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,490
so guys will say things

449
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,280
an advocate policies against their own
self-interest because it offers them the

450
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,620
opportunity

451
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,230
to when an argument for sound like a
clever geyer sound like the tough guy

452
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,559
you holds up the regime and you hear
them say things like

453
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,720
what kind of success it ain't broke
don't fix it

454
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,000
Al Gore invented the internet

455
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,270
two people trade if it makes them both
better off

456
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:10,809
a rising tide lifts all boats everyone
who supports abortion has already been

457
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,190
born

458
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,880
software patents held to the little guy

459
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,610
do the crime do the time

460
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:24,809
life's not fair deal with it where the
most ridiculous whiners

461
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,940
I'm from the government and I'm here to
help

462
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,350
which is followed by this sinister
snickering as if the government ever

463
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,429
helps people in ways other than giving
them a lot of

464
00:27:34,429 --> 00:27:37,620
free money agricultural subsidies and

465
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,169
Social Security and every time he repeat
one of these lines near helping the

466
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:43,049
sabotage

467
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:46,690
opposition to the status quo before get
started

468
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,750
the distraction engine would be the
entertainment industry

469
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,820
things like rock and rap which do
nothing but reinforce behavior that

470
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,600
keeps people in place

471
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,929
pop music is the worst in order to sell
it has to be as I really bland

472
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:06,580
in offensive as possible so encouraging
conformity

473
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,000
and copulation is the order of the day

474
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,840
most songs you hear on the radio will
praise

475
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,650
these two questionable motives

476
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,700
in between entertainment we get
advertisements telling us how personal

477
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,090
inadequacies can be compensated for with
products

478
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,100
and sadly it really is how we compensate

479
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,919
we need movies to fulfil things missing
from our lives

480
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,110
we look up to celebrities who read
comfortable lives that we can never have

481
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,030
celebrities are a pantheon of deities
for culture of my nose pierced

482
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,590
held up for us to gaze upon as we lie in
the gutter

483
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,309
so much for media computers and
communications technology

484
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,710
on the other hand aren't yet entirely
coopted and controlled

485
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,960
I think it's imperative that we keep it
that way

486
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,270
because technology in a sense defines
what we are as a species

487
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:09,210
you cannot separate humans from their
technology

488
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,360
writing is one technology it gave us

489
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,230
external data storage you no longer had
to have a a town man who would

490
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,210
re site the traditions have the culture
from one generation to the next

491
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,390
now people do criticize that aural
tradition

492
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,880
as being prone to errors et cetera I
actually

493
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,669
speculate that oral tradition allows the
storyteller to look at the environment

494
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:34,679
around him

495
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,080
alter the stories appropriately such
that is

496
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,478
group might behave a little more
rationally

497
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,940
ridable values that don't work in a
particular

498
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,309
environment now mathematics which was
made possible

499
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:53,259
by writing gave us external symbolic
manipulation

500
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:57,739
it enabled the existence of science and
reason it is the basis of Western

501
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:58,809
civilization

502
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,889
recently computers give us external
cognition

503
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:06,309
that's new a kid with a computer

504
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,369
can in some areas

505
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:13,409
outperform and unenhanced math professor

506
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:17,570
and an enhanced chess champion or an
enhanced research librarian

507
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,379
we can take math to entirely new levels
before we were limited by manipulations

508
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:25,049
that could be performed by individual
humans

509
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:30,469
now we're not computers are likely to
play as strong a supporting role across

510
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:31,519
sciences

511
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,769
as mathematics and writing some science
may even be rewritten in computational

512
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,509
terms

513
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:43,589
there's a big push to do that by some
people notably Steve will from

514
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:47,149
conrad souza in Germany

515
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:51,629
in the late 60's early 70's was
speculating that maybe some other laws

516
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:52,320
of physics

517
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,678
would be better captured by

518
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,589
automata models this external

519
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:04,499
cognitive apparatus is coupled with the
Internet telephone and cellular networks

520
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:08,619
which constitute a planetary nervous
system

521
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:11,950
it's now a fundamental part of what we
are as human beings

522
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:17,419
political and market elites have no more
business controlling your technology

523
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:21,479
then they have controlling what books
you read and what Matthew study

524
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:26,229
win cognition is external thought police
become a real

525
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:30,399
when cognition is distributed
surveillance his mind reading

526
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,589
censorship is debilitating

527
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:37,149
everyone has a right to be human and
today

528
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:40,649
that means having control over the
technology in your life

529
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,899
external data storage writing

530
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:48,909
is seen as a sacred human right external
symbolic

531
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:53,739
manipulation external symbolic
computation

532
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:57,009
mathematics and computer science

533
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:00,549
must also be elevated to their rightful
status

534
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:05,869
as secret human rights anytime someone
else's business model is not compatible

535
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:09,069
with human rights that business model
has to change

536
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:13,149
will be made to go out of business that
is the only way to safeguard what few

537
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:14,200
rights we have

538
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,929
for the last 50 years since the hydrogen
bomb

539
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:21,759
assured in the dawn of the modern age a
new kind of elite has been

540
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:27,029
crawling out of the suburbs quietly
infesting telephone networks radio waves

541
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,239
University Computer Systems academia

542
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:35,119
bulletin boards any internet the
entrenched political and economic powers

543
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,429
were too busy manipulating the media to
notice by the time they caught

544
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:45,839
on it was too late we're already here so
who is the technological

545
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,129
elite well right now it's anyone with
the brainpower to take control of

546
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:51,029
Technology

547
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:54,239
anyone can be part love this tech set

548
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:58,190
all you have to do is take things apart
and figure out how they work

549
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:03,190
like a child or a scientist it's
amazingly democratic in that regard

550
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,849
but if political and market powers get
their weight control will be taken out

551
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:09,149
of our hands. permanently

552
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:13,079
and you can yield to the hands-on
imperative when technology is not in

553
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,019
your hands

554
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:18,889
the alternative to authoritarian control

555
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:22,940
Co opting the technological elite as was
done with the media

556
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,049
may be difficult because there are too
many others

557
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:30,399
and having grown up on the margins we
may have value systems that are not

558
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,869
compatible with Dean coopted

559
00:33:32,869 --> 00:33:35,909
it is of course possible to coop to
small number

560
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:40,309
love high-tech firms willing to
cooperate with the entrenched powers

561
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:45,039
so legalize monopolies granted through
software patents and bizarre copyright

562
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:45,989
clauses

563
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:49,700
may be a viable route either way the
tech

564
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,299
ends up out of our hands technology

565
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:56,799
is supposedly the daughter of Science

566
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,599
so we could look at the mother to

567
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,658
see where the daughter will be going in
a few years

568
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:07,399
the attitude held by authorities is that
scientists should be

569
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,450
on tap but never on top

570
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,569
I think it was winston churchill who
first waste

571
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:19,279
that opinion among some other unsavory
ideas he had

572
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:22,929
now academia and the grant system do
seem to keep

573
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:26,859
scientists just complacent enough

574
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:30,529
the DMCA has really been pushing that in
recent years

575
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:34,129
it downsizing research budgets under
reagan

576
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:37,730
and the closure research labs across the
country

577
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,819
is pushing it in that regard but so far
people are still barely complacent

578
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:43,639
enough

579
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:46,980
a tech is different because people
empowered with computers and

580
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,859
communications technology are dangerous

581
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:54,288
there are some extreme ideas out there
held by people who seldom engage in

582
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:55,849
reality testing

583
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:59,039
there are some extreme truths out there

584
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,670
that have in previously unknown to
people who've never been exposed to

585
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,170
those

586
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:08,309
realities they will change the world
tremendously

587
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:12,220
authorities may have to choose between
letting people have

588
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,559
technological power and a police state

589
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:19,180
my guess is that they'll choose the
police state because fascism usually

590
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,058
pops up

591
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:23,880
when people are frightened at slipping
an economic status

592
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,140
as for where the tech said came from
everyone has their

593
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,339
series and traditions and miners

594
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:35,549
a little less standard and perhaps less
flattering

595
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:38,770
it seems to me that the offspring a

596
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,549
the military-industrial complex probably
came from the military industrial

597
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:44,509
complex itself

598
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,980
if I had to pinpoint urchin Jack torie
I'm I might say the Institute for

599
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,069
Advanced Studies

600
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:54,589
rand Los Alamos the comma

601
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:57,710
would be one john fund my man but

602
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,480
that's very far in the past now

603
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,279
I do think that there are multiple
strains within the tech said

604
00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:12,779
there are people who came out of the
military background the people whose

605
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:17,589
existence is made possible by the
production's military-industrial complex

606
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:21,619
they built the bomb a bill the first
computers in america

607
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:24,740
to calculate how we could build this
bomb

608
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:29,089
would ignite the atmosphere all sorts
serve problems

609
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:33,529
and of course it was John by my man
behind much of that behind the push to

610
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:36,289
build the H-bomb in the escalating arms
race

611
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:40,779
which then funded a lot of game theory
which also produced the neoclassical

612
00:36:40,779 --> 00:36:43,420
economic system which is the model that

613
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,869
the rightists use so-called free trade
liberalize everything no protection no

614
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:49,539
social anything

615
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:54,279
laissez-faire in the invisible handle
rise everybody's boats I suppose

616
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:58,420
there is also a strain that came out at
the

617
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,660
freaking community at abbey hoffman and

618
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,890
the yippies people dedicated to social
change

619
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:09,509
playing with technology to were not
directly involved with military

620
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:12,819
industrial complex itself but there's a
great deal of overlap

621
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:16,770
and many of the first idealistic Akers
who constructed the net which was

622
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,069
supposed to be a device that would stay
up during a nuclear attack

623
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:24,140
were actually funded by the Department

624
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,769
fans the the military-industrial complex
more or less

625
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:32,250
created this technological world that we
live in

626
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,279
think there's a side project or
side-effect

627
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:39,809
the atom bomb the Cold War realize
asians about

628
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:44,960
and trippy information theory cracking

629
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,000
to cryptographic systems and the like

630
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,170
but regardless that's just my particular
theory in a

631
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:56,319
I don't actually no where we came from

632
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:00,349
nevertheless an increasing trend love

633
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:03,970
creeping and devastating force over the
last half-century

634
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:09,289
has BN the incorporation love computing
and communications technologies

635
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,619
into every aspect of our lives in World
use

636
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:15,770
from day to day living and business
models to

637
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:19,089
research science and academic
disciplines

638
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:23,349
now with the internet linking collective
human knowledge in exposing people to

639
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:26,900
new ideas and alternative information
sources

640
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,270
we may even be due for a new renaissance
now post nineties that might sound like

641
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,940
dreadful Silicon Valley rhetoric is how
we're going to

642
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,759
developed the third world in give water
to two billion people who don't have

643
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:42,720
access to clean drinking water

644
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,910
but they're really maybe a renaissance
of sorts

645
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,078
at least in america which i think needs
one there has been a lot of Renaissance

646
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,660
based fiction lately

647
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,460
coupled with an increasing sense that we
are living in the dark ages

648
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,770
materializing against the supposed
spiritual hunger

649
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,029
that fuels ignorance is a new curiosity
about

650
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:08,029
ration and reason what is the scientific

651
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:12,500
method and its very sad to say this

652
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,069
but we now have the compelling incentive

653
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:19,569
to understand the world that we live in

654
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:23,430
so maybe this is an exciting time to be
alive

655
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,609
similar in some regards 21 century ago
when the clockwork model at the universe

656
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:32,848
perfect determinism the ordered society
of Queen Victoria and

657
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:36,430
Europe's dynasties appeared stable and
timeless

658
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,788
yet collapsed on the a few years later
summer are timeless models

659
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:44,359
reality me collapse they may fall apart

660
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:48,848
in short order what is driving this as
far as I can tell

661
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:53,829
is largely a new world view that's base
to some extent and computation

662
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:57,539
which is a science built up around a
device

663
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:01,420
of course writing and mathematics in a
sense were built up around the device is

664
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:01,710
a

665
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:06,440
paper and hands as one example love

666
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,469
a model if reality that we accept as a
moral imperative an inherent spiritual

667
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:12,509
truth

668
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:17,589
free market fundamentalism or the
so-called neoclassical economics program

669
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:22,400
has been propped up for decades in like
have knowingly faulty mathematical

670
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,750
underpinnings and it has been computer
science

671
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,200
more than anything else that has
identified these faults

672
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,309
it first prove that Nash equilibria

673
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:35,549
is game theoretic solutions to these

674
00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:39,130
economic models that are completely
detached from reality

675
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:41,980
you can solve these people can solve
these there what you call in computer

676
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,400
science and P complete meaning that you
have to test

677
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,650
every single possible solution to these
things

678
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,099
an ash didn't actually have that much
involvement in economics what he did was

679
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,420
disprove a fixed point theorem 2
abstracted game theory

680
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,160
but people took baton applied it then
Robert Axelrod with this computer

681
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,279
simulations

682
00:40:59,279 --> 00:41:03,339
a game theoretic players incentives and

683
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:06,420
the way the game theoretic model spread
said hey guys is

684
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,000
this national Librium where everyone
just defects because it's in their best

685
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,460
interest never to cooperate

686
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:17,770
that doesn't work his computer models
have it working nature shows it working

687
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,859
mean according to this neo-classical
program

688
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:25,000
opec wouldn't exist because every
individual country has an incentive to

689
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,469
produce more oil

690
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:30,089
when some guys you know agreeing to
restrict the oil production so although

691
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:31,690
packwood fall apart

692
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,170
basie the a free market economist they
don't think very far in the future they

693
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,690
didn't think really one step into the
future on this one

694
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,680
because anytime you have a continued
cooperation with people future

695
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,859
interactions

696
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:49,089
you want to cooperate with them because
it's not a zero-sum game and opec does a

697
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:53,630
lot better by cooperating in the long
term and milking us for a lot of money

698
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,259
then they get by having one guy defect
once and then have to sell oil at

699
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:05,259
free market prices for the time until
oil runs out

700
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:09,029
so the recent worldwide failures

701
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:12,509
a IMF policies which have destroyed

702
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:16,059
many countries in many people's lives

703
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:19,940
are based on these new classical models
to these abstract ideas

704
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,980
have devastating real-world consequences

705
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:29,980
yet no one every thought to ask do these
models in some way correspond to reality

706
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,140
the failure supply-side economics in the
nineteen eighties the idea that lowering

707
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,960
taxes would increase revenue

708
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,250
well that didn't work oddly enough

709
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:46,400
so I would advise the hardcore
libertarian free market types to start

710
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,829
backpedaling now

711
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:50,529
there's a very good way you can do that
just say well I had to adopt an

712
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:53,170
extremist position because the state was
too strong

713
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,239
and you know I didn't really think it
now you know what with tear we've got a

714
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,170
and strengthen the state back to

715
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,690
fascism in capitalism know our all wave
doing things

716
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:06,039
I expect computing communications
technology to become

717
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:09,480
as important as traditional writing
mathematics and that is why it is

718
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,059
imperative to establish a precedent
right now the computation belongs to the

719
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:13,690
people

720
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,640
not to the politicians and businessmen
we have an opportunity right now

721
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,058
we cannot afford to lose computing and
communications technology

722
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:24,779
as we lost the media fortunately the
struggle for control

723
00:43:24,779 --> 00:43:27,969
between the people and the authorities
is strongly asymmetric

724
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:31,069
by exploiting these asymmetries we
should be able to keep fire

725
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:35,460
in the hands of mortals special interest
group exceeding corrupting democracy

726
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,650
because they have a huge incentive to
support legislation which benefits

727
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,400
themselves

728
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,539
at public expense and while the cost to
society may be high

729
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:47,170
the distributed cost to each member of
society isn't high enough to inspire

730
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,650
mobilization

731
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,630
consequently checks and balances are
less stable when financial interests are

732
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,680
lopsided a middle ground compromise
position

733
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,919
may not be tenable because special
interest shown time and again that they

734
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,349
will hammer away

735
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:06,640
at the middle positions Intel they get
their extreme interest fulfilled

736
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,549
now there are many inherent asymmetries
that favor the people on this one

737
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:14,029
as long as we keep up the good fight
cryptography in distributed

738
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:15,270
communications

739
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,288
there to asymmetric to be controlled
without a police state

740
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:22,579
our constitution should protect us data
can be improved encrypt it

741
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:26,359
and it can be cracked its impractical to
do it

742
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:30,109
information once at the bag is at the
back for ever provided that we are

743
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:32,848
always here to keep it out of the bag

744
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:37,430
this increased access to information
empowers increasing numbers on our side

745
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,629
well the powerful interests are fixed in
number and financial resources

746
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,369
anytime we know how to do something even
if not immediately necessary

747
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:49,380
means they should someone be presented
with the need it will be possible

748
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,119
security of information is easier to
achieve than anonymity and obscured

749
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,250
signal flow but I would hope that one of
anonymous actions for whistleblowers

750
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:02,009
could remain possible authorities forced
to act on behalf the special interests

751
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:04,289
are restricted by our Constitution

752
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:08,200
by their time by their financial
resources they can't fight this

753
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,579
effectively without destroying the
Constitution

754
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,789
and I hope they can't get away with
doing that

755
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:19,239
you also have laws that are not uniform
across nations

756
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:22,239
and that will allow you to escape

757
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,450
certainly rationalize corporations do
this to escape taxation to escape human

758
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,579
rights legislation to exclude

759
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:34,359
escape labor unions and labor protection
laws so we might as well take advantage

760
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:37,558
of it because they certainly are

761
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:40,900
to people and organizations in power
have very little foresight

762
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,930
they care about all for staying in power
where at least

763
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:48,299
exiting power with this many teams as
possible left to their own devices they

764
00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:51,170
will behave like a greedy search
algorithm

765
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,119
regardless a future consequences their
approach to control is to manipulate

766
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,559
incentives

767
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,089
they view behaviors as markets to
discourage behaviors they do not like

768
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:04,489
the pair exclusion from the market with
high-cost

769
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:08,549
exclusion is achieved through technical
barriers and outlying communication

770
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:12,430
have knowledge and tools to circumvent
these barriers raising the cost means

771
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,339
raising the cost to being caught

772
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:17,489
this can come from catching many people
are from catching just a few and

773
00:46:17,489 --> 00:46:19,170
punishing disproportionately

774
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:23,730
which is more common we can defeat the
technical barriers

775
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,089
and we have to because anytime a self
interested

776
00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:30,690
atomic 10 or agent or rational

777
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,670
creature has coercive power over another
the subjugated

778
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,650
atomic 10 will be forced to act any
interests are the dominant one

779
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:41,750
as mechanically as night follows day

780
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:45,670
this is why freedom is preferable to
subordination

781
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:50,589
the more power authorities have the more
power they can use to consolidate

782
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:55,000
their power conversely the more freedom
we have the more freedom

783
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,210
we can use to propagate freedom from
mobs in tyrants

784
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:03,809
we can easily defeat technological
barriers if we keep trying

785
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:07,809
law is not necessarily a moral authority

786
00:47:07,809 --> 00:47:11,980
it is a coercive authority it is
increasingly unreliable in areas of

787
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,599
science and technology

788
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,910
especially when the special interests
are writing the rules we need to be able

789
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,589
when necessary for the good of humanity
to circumvent

790
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:24,730
certain irrational laws perhaps we could

791
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:28,540
ultimately take back freedom of the
press and the electromagnetic spectrum

792
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,489
or as many people here are doing

793
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:35,989
enable better alternatives we have a
window of opportunity

794
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:41,099
right now to stop special interests from
doing to computing and communications

795
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:42,250
technology

796
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,670
what needed to media if we can
circumvent

797
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,449
digital rights management serial number
in bedding and other friends too

798
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,329
anonymity

799
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:55,190
spyware surveillance we can defeat the
technical barriers

800
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:58,230
if the EU and other victims

801
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:01,290
love intellectual property imperialism

802
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:05,109
fight against software patents and
proprietary protocols

803
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:08,650
we can sees strong pressure for legal
reform

804
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:13,390
the laws may change very slowly but if
we consistently defeat

805
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,949
technical barriers and keep the people
empowered

806
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:22,190
we can establish social norms it will
force the laws to change

807
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,630
above all at any cost and by any
available means

808
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:31,969
we must continue to exist because we are
the front line of defense

809
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:38,969
against the technological tyranny
special-interest

810
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:50,460
ok

811
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,830
will

812
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:10,380
yeah

813
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,449
yes if you want to get that speech I
suppose I'll have to rated up in a

814
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,189
readable legible format for you it will
be available

815
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:24,359
on es como dot com slash think I E merit
till they had a net you can also get it

816
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:25,150
from

817
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,479
magic peace farm dot com

818
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:32,199
slash hyena that's probably the best one
to go to

819
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,479
magic peace farm dot com slash China

820
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:39,849
if you google me I'm sure it will popup
once a

821
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:45,239
get it written we have a bell

822
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:52,239
one more minute left anybody have a
burning question for Jason yes sir

823
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,210
because there are more

824
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:02,309
the government contains a very small
number of people with very specialized

825
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,990
interests

826
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:07,009
the people as a whole have more people

827
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:10,970
and are divergent interest end average
out which is why we're a little more

828
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:11,839
trustworthy

829
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:18,839
yes now

830
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:46,030
well they often talk one thing but their
models there think tanks their

831
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,840
conclusions are used to justify

832
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:54,840
policies that are very hurtful too many
people

833
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:16,710
yes they're paid for results

834
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,670
well i'd doubt they would be willing to
work there if they didn't in some way

835
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,830
believe in what they did and if they
were financially dependent on employment

836
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:23,620
in a think tank

837
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,109
I think they could adjust their values
to compensate for that
