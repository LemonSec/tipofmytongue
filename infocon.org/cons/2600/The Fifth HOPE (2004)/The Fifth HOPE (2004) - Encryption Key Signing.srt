1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,330
rerun a microphone when i was up here

2
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,350
uh... okay so i guess while we're
waiting for the rest the people on the

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,740
list of filter and

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,989
on mom's say

5
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:17,369
dr okay you asked me would have a
problem

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,019
whatever on some people are here so off
they filter and later we'll skip over

7
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,939
him and come back to him afterwards

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,130
uh...

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:29,570
who here doesn't really know what's
going on

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,610
all right

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,700
arming how so i got somethin right

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,499
uh... arcade cell-based flu what we're
doing here it is a key signing party

13
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:43,949
uh... anybody

14
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,570
and seen how

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,520
uh... description stuff this fancy pants
like that has a kitchen stuff like will

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,580
trust

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,420
are the whole premise behind it is that

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,230
in order to make sure that he's are
trustworthy

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,110
rather than try to verify every single
one appears out

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,309
you assigned trust other people

21
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:04,590
and then

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,080
if you know somebody trust them and may
not somebody and they trust them

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,450
and you trust their judgment then you
trust third-person

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,299
handed

25
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,189
chains along hopefully you can grab some
of these people you've never met before

26
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,000
and

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
computer trust metrics on it

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,500
and go

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,770
okay well i've never met this person
before but

30
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,940
because i know this person who knows
this person is this person

31
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,960
than i think they're okay

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,810
because it chains all the way down to
the southern person

33
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,360
to do this everybody needs to like
signed keys if possible and try to

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,600
extend this web of trust out to as many
people as possible

35
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,470
so that's why we're here right now

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,250
uh...

37
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,689
basically i'm pissed off because every
single contact into in the past i've

38
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,619
gone around handing out business cards
with mikey fingerprint on it and people

39
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,980
are like over what's what's signatures
this will be awesome

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,670
and i go home at sinai ki and i'll put
into the key server eric whatsoever

41
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,530
and they never signed mine

42
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,510
and so i've got like five signatures on
my key because people are scum bags

43
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,610
i don't like that so we're gonna go to
signing we're gonna do it the right way

44
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,719
we're going to officially and its hope
we're going to work cell

45
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:14,638
uh... what we're going to do is relate
to

46
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,879
uh... comes by must participate

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,119
you'll be in the west

48
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,909
the list has everybody's keys

49
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,640
on it that if they sent their keys to me
in advance

50
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,699
so we're going to go through those first

51
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:29,229
uh... basically will go down the list
and will pick up the people

52
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:32,299
and dole come up and i'll read off their
key fingerprint

53
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:35,569
and you can all with the collapsed and
make sure it matches up

54
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,709
and me so you don't have to trust what's
on the paper

55
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,199
cure what they say in a few

56
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,519
check it off

57
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,969
uh... we'll also be doing i_d_
verification

58
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,349
online those people that

59
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:51,909
i will ask somebody for photo i_d_ if
they want to sign their king

60
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:55,448
on the lot of people get very offended
when i asked for this which is kinda

61
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:56,379
weird

62
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,239
because identity verification is just as
important as key verification

63
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,019
because here you know it's all well and
good effort key is valid matches up to

64
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,040
electronic

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,519
copy that you get

66
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,880
blight if you know i went around saying
cures mikey

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,469
here's my teachers mikey

68
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,409
and it said emmanuel goldstein on the
key is the name

69
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,448
and then you said hey well i want to
tell a manual hungry unwise

70
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,859
and use the kenya send it to me

71
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,379
that's no good

72
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,649
i_d_ verification is just as important

73
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:30,829
i don't understand that a lot of people
are very uncomfortable with this so if

74
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,579
you're a good with this them sharp your
idea that's what i'm gonna be dylan for

75
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,409
not courting it in any way

76
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,849
so it's not going to go out to the
internet at large

77
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,059
if you're not

78
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:44,698
then you can try to prove your i_d_ n
any other way that you want

79
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,209
but it's got to to the people out there
whether they consider acceptable enough

80
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,259
to sign off on your case

81
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,319
so however you want to deal with it

82
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,439
deal with it

83
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,769
but we're gonna try to do this as
quickly as possible

84
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,319
and i really suggest if you have your
real name on your key show your i_d_

85
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,129
is a major scumbag

86
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:05,269
other than you know

87
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:06,389
uh...

88
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,489
she is watch out for her she shifty

89
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:13,889
i have no problems with showing off

90
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,689
my idea people on

91
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,310
then again i also had

92
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,650
few hundred people of my apartment last
night so whatever

93
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,359
i guess on you copied bashid

94
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,469
helpful

95
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,979
pomp

96
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:35,650
i guess paul just start off by saying
that i have three keys

97
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,439
on the cheek

98
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:45,439
meter

99
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,060
yet uh... dole read your own fingerprint
from this shit

100
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,580
like you're supposed to approximate time
otherwise

101
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,779
on because if you read your fingerprint
from that she'd i could have fucked with

102
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:56,169
it

103
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:57,008
and

104
00:04:57,009 --> 00:04:59,039
then you're reading off of that
fingerprint that

105
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,849
i do agree screw-up

106
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,589
like i don't trust you and you should
not trust me

107
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,269
uh... do not

108
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,639
dv sheets are here for your convenience

109
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,979
do not trust m

110
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,758
they could be wrong i could have messed
with them somehow i could be trying to

111
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,460
tax or you all

112
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,609
uh... which is why everybody has to make
sure that they convey to the audience

113
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,040
that the information of theirs on this
sheet is correct

114
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,550
and there's little boxes next to the
information so you can check it off once

115
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,089
you verify that

116
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:29,689
and

117
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,979
please don't need your finger print off
the sheik

118
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,279
is what's being said

119
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:37,770
uh... do we have more people who need

120
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,849
of the lists

121
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:42,710
well

122
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,400
uh... i i think it's on the

123
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,400
page

124
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,740
alright so and three eighths use

125
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,009
on third kids on right hand side

126
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:03,129
uh... my name is uh... party for those
of you who don't know on

127
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,529
will be showing off my photo i_d_ to
confirm my and even though it's like

128
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,310
printed and things like

129
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,849
and program

130
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:15,210
if anybody would like to come up here
and take a look at my out-of-date

131
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,568
lessons

132
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:23,569
uh... it still valid just don't with
massachusetts more

133
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,240
okay if you want to do it that way our
courses actually willing to show i d

134
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,929
allow of exxon i was not expecting that

135
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:36,289
uh... okay we can use to an i_d_ ran
robin afterwards for everybody who wants

136
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,509
delighting otherwise just say are not
comfortable and you can come up and try

137
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:42,479
to figure out some of the way of doing
it

138
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,150
but i'm a bs lists

139
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,009
the information for me on the sheets are
correct

140
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,800
on if you really want to read off the
fingerprints simony

141
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,970
mature enough to fingerprints

142
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,139
not all understand under sound like a
printed all these up myself side

143
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,229
are would start arm

144
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,460
my de s a contrarian artillery

145
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,059
uh... the one on the

146
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,150
operate

147
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,729
of the last page

148
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,960
uh... b f six three

149
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,740
is there a list of them three bc a one
de seven b

150
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,269
you do you want

151
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,030

uh... please don't sign this unless you
have a nice achey

155
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:34,289

compatibility with people who use pgp

156
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,680
two still

157

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,010
armed to remain standing by me

533
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,929
rule came in late

534
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:24,929
yes i will uh... kind of people came in
late arched one up

535
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,640
so so there was a mention of use sub
keys dot pgp dot net the jerky server

536
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,280
especially if they're multiple user
ideas on it because apparently there is

537
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,379
a cheese with key servers moped will
ladies that

538
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,810
i've run into any breaks things so

539
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,330
what's the size of gap turkeys i thought
was you ladies on some keys or something

540
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,260
like that ok arm apparently a multiple
subsidies some key servers will break

541
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,990
so

542
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:59,990
okay yet pilots

543
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,389
right idea at all just emerged when you
do the import

544
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:06,970
okay so

545
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:11,400
on the other mentioned was somebody
mentioned to me and email one this is

546
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,220
getting organized that that apparently
it's very rude to uh...

547
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,170
submit signatures to a key server
directly

548
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,580
i've never heard this before in my life

549
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,070
all my kindest and i think he's not on a
key several ready

550
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,439
on

551
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,500
if u extent most people like i've talked
to no idea of that so

552
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,150
if you would rather your keys

553
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,910
go to a key server

554
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,749
and be sent

555
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,400
directly back to you

556
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,880
uh... i think i'd just let the audience
now likely marked off

557
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,480
but i think almost everybody i talk to
distort it

558
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,910
lines

559
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,180
if you sign somebody skinny

560
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,310
they have to prove that they have
possession of the d crip shin ki

561
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,928
by you taking

562
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:04,660
the your signature on their case you
have their site fee with your new

563
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,980
signature on it

564
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,300
if you just posted that up to a key
server put that into circulation

565
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,730
that doesn't prove that they can d crypt
using that kitty

566
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,450
but if you take that your that signed ki

567
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,520
exported

568
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,929
taken asking just export it

569
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:22,720
encrypt it to that person

570
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,810
only the person who has control of that
d christian t

571
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,059
make any uses that signed ki

572
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,908
the other reason i do it is because

573
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:34,659
error that the other is not request that
for myself is because

574
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:38,480
are use an expression date on my cues

575
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,659
a big reason for that is kind of us

576
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,960
automatic self revocation

577
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,110
incase ever forget my password among
other reasons

578
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,460
and

579
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,460
to default for jpg

580
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,320
is that if you sign a key with an
expression

581
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,800
your signature expires the same time as
the expiration and since i plan on

582
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,270
renewing my keys every so often

583
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,490
i'd prefer to have my signatures on
mikey not expire

584
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:12,490
so as anybody else

585
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,630
the yellow yet that that that's
absolutely true bite

586
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,130
uh... one more thing

587
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,460
