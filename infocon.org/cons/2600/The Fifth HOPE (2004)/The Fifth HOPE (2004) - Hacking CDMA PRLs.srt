1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,840
in about now today we have the profit
talking about CDMA PR else

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,950
handle it and take it away see

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,090
is this thing on okay excellent

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:22,470
and the profit I thought around three
people would be here so I'm a little bit

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,698
surprised to see you all

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,539
%uh CDMA is the dominant mobile phone
technology used

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,040
North America I know there's a lot of
people here from on the other side of

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,800
the Atlantic

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,420
and so I'm hoping others representation

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,800
from there this will not be useful to
you at all

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,929
if you are a GSM persons so if you have
T Mobile as an

12
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:48,609
tears and terrible mobile war

13
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:51,300
AT&T Wireless store singular guess

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,399
the same company house or the stuff

15
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,140
probably won't be very useful to you I
am also just

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,489
take do some business items upright if
you want to learn how to make free phone

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,390
calls

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,759
I don't do that anymore and I haven't
sensed the statute of limitations

19
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,140
expired

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,060
whatever that is if it's not considered
terrorists service you're wanting to

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,960
learn how to make free phone calls this
is not the right place

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,000
I however if you like to take things
apart

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,450
and if you want to know what you're
really buying when you play nationwide

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,259
service from

25
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,080
rise and Alltel sprint US Cellular

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,640
any other CDMA carrier then this is the
talk for you

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,299
and will be demonstrating yes how you
get a PRL

28
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,659
offer handset in particular white Sanyo
7200

29
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,369
I'll after I tell you what parallelism

30
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,450
course and then how you take it apart
and

31
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,289
a look at what's inside so without
further ado

32
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:53,860
I hate PowerPoint with the passion I

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,920
don't generally use this but in this
kinda venue

34
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,110
there's really no alternatives my
apologies in advance

35
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,300
so

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,959
carry our a obviously

37
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,220
Carol hacking your wireless carrier's
watch it now

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,800
so I'm what's a PRL

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,650
if you're going somewhere like montana
you really care what a PRL list because

40
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,510
its what tells your phone where you can
use it

41
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,549
essentially there are a number of
wireless carriers that are compatible

42
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,319
with

43
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,720
your particular handset

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,980
this handset in New York City is
compatible with Sprint

45
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,030
AT&T Wireless with rice

46
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,230
for example and depending which carriers

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,840
you're allowed to use in whatever area
are your and that has

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,459
strong pairing online but the quality of
the coverage is going to be the

49
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,420
experience and also what the typeof
coverage experience s

50
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,930
be a digital or analog

51
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,540
so you can only use the systems that
your carrier specified

52
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,660
even if other systems are available if
your carrier hasn't specified that

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,850
you're allowed to use them

54
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,890
can't so I

55
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,730
has a PRL released well when you buy a
new phone there's a PRL on it

56
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,380
you can get a PRL updated over-the-air

57
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,980
you can you said phone service tool

58
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,450
which is called the PST for short and a
data cable

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,910
and generally you wouldn't do this but
you going to

60
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,940
Wireless store and they do it for you I

61
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,940
and you know back I this

62
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,400
this is a Virgin Mobile's call center in
Spokane Washington

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,770
he was pretty ticked off that we even
went in there and I'm I think you might

64
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,280
break your paralytic

65
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,250
but anyhow wireless carriers

66
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,300
be it for ice and Alltel US Cellular
sprint can and do change PRL ce

67
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,989
and your coverage over the air and they
don't give you any prior notice

68
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,319
still just like your account the next
time you call customer service

69
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,750
film you've got a new PR L and it can
make dramatic and sudden changes to your

70
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,040
coverage services

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,840
you know really a big deal if you travel
use your cellular phone

72
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,069
I wait a minute to you

73
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,919
sorry about that that's the other thing
I hate about PowerPoint a few

74
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,008
pressed the wrong button Texas slide so

75
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,460
how do you hack your PRL and really take
off your wireless carrier that's

76
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,000
probably where you wanna know

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,449
the thing is this isn't something

78
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,940
you know to do it home kids unless you
know exactly what you're doing

79
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,280
because you well void the warranty on
your handset

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,500
I i absolutely guarantee and assure you
way the warranty

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,639
your handset if you attempt to do any
stuff so just know that up front

82
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,910
also know up front that handset didn't
really cost $19.95 it wasn't really free

83
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,819
or whatever

84
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:02,110
if you break your handset messing around
with this stuff you're gonna have to pay

85
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,330
for retail for a new one and I can be

86
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,279
a few hundred dollars so just know what
you're getting yourself into first

87
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,740
on if you make changes to your PRL

88
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,120
then you will violate the Terms of
Service the air carrier has and what

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,900
that means is they can just cancel your
service and sometimes even require you

90
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,120
to pay the early termination

91
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,639
I and there's nothing you can do so

92
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,089
if you change your PR all which I do not
recommend

93
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:36,210
I it might be a good idea not to number
it any differently than the carrier

94
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,138
numbers their own PR else

95
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,259
because they can see what Puroll
revision you're running

96
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,529
your phone and if it's something they've
never released it's probably not

97
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:46,150
something

98
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,819
that should be there and some people
claim this is illegal

99
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:54,050
evidently in pennsylvania its illegal to

100
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,759
even have any information on how to
program a cellular phone

101
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,979
if you're even a cellular store which

102
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,080
doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me
but

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,529
I guess it's only enforced if you're a
hacker or the police think you might be

104
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,490
some sort

105
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,589
person look shady on

106
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,409
but I've never seen any specific laws
against pero

107
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:22,349
packing I'll I have this legal service
plan at work and so I asked an attorney

108
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,529
and she looked and

109
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:28,330
she couldn't find anything so to my
knowledge there are no specific

110
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,960
was against PRL packing check with

111
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,249
your attorney in your jurisdiction to
find out for sure

112
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:40,069
I am so what you do to hack this thing
is you download

113
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,229
the PRL your phone first and

114
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,669
there's a tool called bit him it's open
source

115
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:50,460
its a little rough around the edges
still there's

116
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,279
0.6 she was the last stable release but
it doesn't do a lot of things

117
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,479
you kinda actually to do this stuff
searing to be running some pretty Rob

118
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,849
Bell's

119
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:03,009
I have to stop us the test 11 dole

120
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:06,229
my machine currently I

121
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,008
and what tipped him allows you to do in
addition to sinking

122
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,759
here contacts in your address book and
whatever other

123
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,490
crap its really decide to do on there's
a tool in their to browse the file

124
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,339
system on your handset

125
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:25,610
and that's really need there's there's a
full one file system and every CDMA

126
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,430
handset

127
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,009
and you can get into it with that

128
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:33,719
download any file look at it and they're
so that's another talk but we're going

129
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:34,998
to focus on

130
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:39,610
the PRL the download their ordinarily if
you have

131
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,300
for eisenhower halt all handsets a it
will be in a directory called

132
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,300
black nvm PRL and

133
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,349
the files are helpfully named PRL
underscore wonderful 0

134
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:54,830
and PRL underscore triple-0

135
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,580
what ands those files

136
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,369
represent while that was originally

137
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:06,740
on the phone and the last

138
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,029
won the download so if you reset your
phone to its original factory settings E

139
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:15,719
if you look at your phone there's prolly
mode in there that allows you to reset

140
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:16,649
it exactly

141
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:19,719
was factory I'm it all

142
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:23,860
restore your original prob ship with
that's what that's for

143
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,319
well on San your handset's thats
friendships

144
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,630
those files are blank 30 Quays they
aren't actually use

145
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,620
sprint Berry said in the nvm
subdirectory at the nvm directory and

146
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,260
that's hidden actually

147
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,510
it was several wraps a bit and before
they figured out how to display it

148
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:48,080
and then its DN nvm dash double 019

149
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,470
plainer while and so once you've got
that downloaded not demonstrate how to

150
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,120
do that

151
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,380
Israel stopped I you use a hex editor

152
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:00,760
and you have to truncate the first 86
bytes

153
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,209
anyone it was turning off set up 0.8%

154
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,110
I've got the same here just for
reference because I'm gonna post the

155
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,560
slides for you to tell

156
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,890
later but I'll demonstrate this course

157
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,310
and you'll want to truncate all the
Noles at the end

158
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:20,300
water and then you can now use your
favorite PRL editor

159
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,550
or disassembler to make the
modifications like to make

160
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,330
so what's inside States

161
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,700
the top of the file and I'll show you
what one of these looks like but my one

162
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,500
child these down and I can come back to
this too

163
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,550
you've got an acquisition tax and

164
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,610
the purpose of an acquisition and access
to be able to

165
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,780
locate as quickly as possible

166
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,560
the channels and the frequencies that
whatever carrier

167
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,100
you're using and so you'll have an entry

168
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,520
for an acquisition your will have a
corresponding

169
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,420
acquisition index with the PRL tree I'm
so

170
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,699
for readability and for cheer and to end
a logically split up your PR all they're

171
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,470
separated into geographies

172
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,530
this is also so you can scan through in
priority order

173
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,230
by geography and that's designed as
quickly as possible

174
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,600
and available carrier are arm

175
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,930
a lot of the a waterway a parallel
structure it has to do with performance

176
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,140
in picking up

177
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,720
the carrier that's available in your
area just as quickly as you tried

178
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,010
on you have home systems and you can
market system is homers roaming

179
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,670
and on Sprint phones this is a feature
that rising phone sturgeon not

180
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,900
generally but on Sprint phones you

181
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,770
got an option where you can say only use
the Sprint PCS network

182
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,120
wall that is used to

183
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,180
only scare systems that have been marked
in the PR

184
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,210
was home in that we never have to worry
about roaming charges

185
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,340
and otherwise if you set it automatic

186
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,630
it'll just pick up whichever carriers
available always with the preference

187
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,710
as described pero

188
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,310
and you got roaming systems obviously if
it's not home it's running

189
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,980
and that either cost you extra doesn't
depending

190
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,710
plan and then there's negative from
systems in this gets really interesting

191
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,570
because

192
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,750
carrier can go n and they can say

193
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,360
you can't Rome on this carrier this
other carrier at all

194
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,960
even a few you're calling 911 in sprint
PRL XLarge Lee the systems that are

195
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,150
marked negative

196
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,370
are singular and they do have

197
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,590
one roaming agreement in one area with
singular

198
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,790
what it looks like is if you wanna Rome
a roaming agreement with singular they

199
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,329
open up

200
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,860
roaming to their for darn system and so

201
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,180
the only way that you can prevent that
if your carrier is to

202
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,590
then mark the whole singular system
except what you want to allow negative

203
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:03,330
I am generally carriers ball allows
roaming agreements by specific system ID

204
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,960
so for instance AT&T Wireless which
isn't present in the PRL

205
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,310
you can roam on in the Seattle area and
Portland anyway

206
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,240
Pacific last actually but if you go to
Los Angeles California

207
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,400
you can our AT&T Wireless even if you

208
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,120
I'm so what can you change in these
things well unlike politics

209
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,470
essentially anything appear change but
be careful because your carrier's gonna

210
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,110
catch on

211
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,620
really quickly if your phones doing
something that it should never be able

212
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,150
to do

213
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,670
I'll give you an example the guy who
figured out how to do this stuff

214
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,670
wasn't me his his handles chairman MC

215
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,490
he said Denver and he went into sprl

216
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,610
and on his sprint handset and hacked and
a whole bunch of quest system

217
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,110
is quest I is a local exchange carrier

218
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,680
out on the west coast ands

219
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,000
they wanna wireless network that's then

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,550
crier pretty much cut up and sold off
have to spread

221
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,900
have to rise but it's still operating in
this Kenneth

222
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,800
duct taping chewing way and

223
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,230
as it happens we're jammin MC lives he's
got a quest

224
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,080
our right near him and the Sprint hours
really far away as a sponsor

225
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,970
site so we put in the quest system ID
for hysteria and he was

226
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,570
for whatever reason sprint inquest even
though they don't roam on each other at

227
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,740
all have a roomie

228
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,170
on actually quest runs on Sprint which
is probably why it's reciprocal

229
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,470
but you will know you would never roam
on quest if you have us

230
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,680
spring handset just you neverland on
that

231
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,420
by default and so he was you know
happily using

232
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,340
quest and he not only did that happen
numbered as PR all

233
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,070
something completely wacky that Sprint
would never do

234
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,400
and they caught on in there real hurry
they knew exactly what he was doing

235
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,360
and I haven't heard whether he got a
running goal or not but he was

236
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,940
threatened with the large one so

237
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,970
be careful like again I they're gonna
catch on if your phones doing something

238
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,970
totally black

239
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,700
you can you can tweak things that are
plausible

240
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,650
by you can tweak things that are
impossible

241
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:23,640
and get the most useful things to change
your system ID's and those are

242
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,670
which carrier sure gonna be using
roaming priorities

243
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,320
spread or rise and has a roaming save
see if a rise in

244
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,710
in the pacific northwest has a roaming
partner

245
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,310
US Cellular has this really crappy
network

246
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,750
that the don't have very many towers

247
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,950
go analog allotted just kinda socks and
and it's cheaper for

248
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,240
rise and use them that it is cheese
spread whose

249
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,860
networks way batter strong Washington
say

250
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,870
and you'd rather use Sprint's network in
eastern Washington US Cellular

251
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,710
as this psych well maybe you could
elevate sprint and priority about

252
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,200
US Cellular and you know because the
roaming agreements there that might be

253
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,520
possible

254
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,560
on by you

255
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,260
so so that's where priority come in
useful you could improve your coverage

256
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,189
questions and additional forces and
allied so

257
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,700
on sprint for example until recently

258
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,140
would only allow you to choose from

259
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,600
analog unless you're on another CDMA
1900 system

260
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,000
so that's because it was cheaper

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,560
there this old handsets that were
compatible

262
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,350
prime you could digitally well rise n

263
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,260
technically and they have their own the
agreement in place they just in a lower

264
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,900
four-c_d_ battery draining crackly
crappy analog

265
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,700
I'm so this is still the case in some
areas for instance in the most recent

266
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,540
PRL Rev

267
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,880
Alltel just got knocked analog and
decent check

268
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,000
Michigan it was digital be force if you
wanted to put it back

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,980
so once you've downloaded the thing and
tweeted you know I'm a demo hi

270
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,420
do that how do you upload it back into
your phone wall

271
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,510
very carefully please you can fry your
phone if you make a mistake

272
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,890
in particular if you have a plan PRL and
you uploaded by mistake

273
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,960
then you're gonna have unusable
unbelievable

274
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,220
be toasted and its out of warranty
because you mess with it

275
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,760
and all know you best so

276
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,189
basically please be careful with this
and don't blame you if you fire

277
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,770
um and in general you're in any the
phone service tool that these are really

278
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,920
interesting because

279
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,950
they're made by the cell carriers ants

280
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,260
pardon me they're made by the handset
manufacturers and their provider the

281
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,250
cell carriers

282
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,360
and you when I can't just download them

283
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,910
from the so carriers page day Heidi
behind so

284
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:01,889
you have to be you know registered
official ID

285
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,740
wat up law pay SSL page that's all

286
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,240
dedicated yesterday if you wanna get
access to it

287
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,410
you have to fill out some crazy for me
tell them all

288
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,319
wireless carrier work foreign as far as
I know these things are free but they

289
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,250
just don't give them to normal people
they only give them

290
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,890
to wireless carriers but if you go out
on these peer to peer networks I don't

291
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,669
know how

292
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,410
this is but it seems that they're out
there

293
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,470
over net for instance also known as
donkey

294
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:37,650
you can find a whole lotta CDMA tools
I'm check cause

295
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,299
those but if you want to get one

296
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,910
these that maybe your past alternative
if you don't have a friend works for

297
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,370
sale

298
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:49,929
star on and

299
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,500
I'd like to acknowledge you know before
it began that

300
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,830
this isn't stuff that I've done
completely

301
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:03,870
I've done some work in this area shade
things lifetime but except fast and

302
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:04,410
cinema

303
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,890
have rate cycle wireless wave like stock

304
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,470
they've done very extensive data mining

305
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,740
FCC filings

306
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,770
there's a number FCC databases they've
got

307
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:22,570
crazy wireless spectrum maps and they
can tell you exactly

308
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,689
who has wireless spectrum in what part
of the country and its

309
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,929
they have been a tremendous resource to
me

310
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:35,040
and somebody somebody's activities our
Chairman MC

311
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,350
plus his soul he figured out how to
create custom PRL Sen

312
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,830
even though he did things not quite the
right way

313
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,918
on his personal account he did at least
tell

314
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,059
other people get started and

315
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,918
just a lurker are up just a lurker dot
com

316
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,740
on developed the methodology for

317
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,919
PRL interpretations so he really is

318
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,740
data mining expert he went out and took
a lot of this information that was an

319
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,179
FCC databases and other sources

320
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:12,520
and he put it all together you know it's
one thing to pull a PR a lot of phone

321
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,570
it's quite another to actually take it
apart

322
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,740
know what it means and know which system
'it's correspond with what carriers and

323
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,710
be able to present that it information
human-readable

324
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,070
meaningful way and just to workers the
first I did

325
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,120
somebody I know does it now

326
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,260
for spread he's he's not here but

327
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,570
yet that's

328
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,790
that methodologies carried over to other
carriers

329
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,620
and other PR also you know this this is
all

330
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,010
work that the whole is

331
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:52,240
greater than the sum of its parts for
sure so

332
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,659
without further ado let's get to the
damn

333
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:59,020
she is probably what you came for

334
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:06,020
I sure nikita what's up

335
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:28,710
are really depends on the handset the
carrier there's

336
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,730
any scan set with the PRL and a you can

337
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,789
take the PRL out play with it or repeat
the question

338
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:38,610
nekia wanted to know if you have a
handset the

339
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,380
than all handset that you've reactivated
with the different carrier

340
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,380
can you edit the pron and any handset
that uses

341
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,779
CDMA technology and has a pron

342
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:54,360
this methodology work but

343
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,250
on to be clear in may be slightly
different depending on your handset

344
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,919
I'm you know specifically limiting the
scope this damn about you

345
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,399
my a Sanyo 7200 this the same thing
works with Sania forty-nine hundreds

346
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:12,639
send you any 100's the files

347
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:17,549
may be in different locations on other
phones the hexadecimal offsets

348
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:21,908
maybe will be the same boat what how
many points you need to Truckee

349
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,970
to get there might be slightly different
so I am

350
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,120
point being that yes you can do it you
might have to hack around a little bit

351
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,590
in order

352
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,668
things working to you and a partial
needed data cable

353
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:40,830
so that's that's another so let's get
that Pam

354
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,919
popped up in here

355
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:52,220
yeah

356
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,120
okay so to repeat the question I'll

357
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,330
it is the USB data cable

358
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,928
for the serial data cable better I use
the USB data cable

359
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,309
I have not used the serial data cable I
don't see any reason why the serial data

360
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:07,850
cable

361
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,880
wouldn't work but the USB cable does and
that's what I use

362
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,809
so

363
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:18,980
inside bit him you know it's

364
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,500
it does I'm not gonna go to the phone
book because that will actually

365
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,530
display all of the numbers friends

366
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,460
I'm yes sorry

367
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,280
but you can do you can sync your phone
book

368
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,370
and your you know wallpaper ringtones
and calendar and all that playing

369
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,290
crap that I don't care least except one
thing

370
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:51,290
yeah up demo that yet

371
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,630
oh you're here in just a moment

372
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:01,630
reasoning my singular actually works

373
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,580
Inc

374
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:17,580
ok yep that's the one piece implying
that I care about on my phone and only

375
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,499
this crowd would actually know what that
is

376
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,960
but on yeah

377
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,840
are so the filesystems the interesting
part and so will browse the filesystem

378
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,158
here

379
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:35,159
conceal adults

380
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,550
and victims free it's open source since
this

381
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:46,190
things

382
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,250
okay and so my demos not blowing up yet

383
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,860
that's amazing I'm so you got a lot of
fun stuff in here

384
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,120
and what we care about is the end p.m.
directory

385
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,540
and GM's non-volatile memory thick

386
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,899
and in here

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,559
oh oh look they're trying to fake you
know you got this PR 0 directory so on a

388
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,480
rice in hand save your PR olds will
always be here

389
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,460
these actually will be the PR also so
you're download these

390
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,809
you'll be sad but not spread no there
there little more clever

391
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:23,700
that they've got this hidden nvm
directory that you gotta read the file

392
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,630
system a special way to even see a

393
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,570
and once you're in here there's all this
you know intuitively name stuff

394
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,760
and so what I had to do was actually
just

395
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,660
you know go through all of these impacts
room until I figure out which one

396
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,740
was pero in this case its nvm

397
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,960
IIT thats that's what this is

398
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,320
we're gonna save it and will save it

399
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,620
choose sure save it to

400
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:59,620
said directory

401
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:09,920
so now that I've got this here I can
close up

402
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:16,429
and i wanna pop open hex editor

403
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:19,950
and I use XP I 32 you can use any

404
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:23,419
acceptor like this one's free and its
its

405
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:27,639
easy to use so

406
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:34,639
we go into you demo directory

407
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,619
placement here

408
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:48,260
know it yes right sorry thanks

409
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,830
okay so then we get to truncate fights
and

410
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:58,830
yeah we've got a truck 86 so

411
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,910
okay and so I can't really delete that
fast

412
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,130
and cow but you know I

413
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,180
their I knew it was somewhere in the
eighties and we do issue you're looking

414
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,570
for the first of say

415
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:28,830
Arab 0 that's that's the correct jobs

416
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,649
and so then we scroll down to the

417
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,760
you see all these dolls

418
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,440
there's like a mile and

419
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:49,440
they all have to go

420
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,400
so yeah I get to sit here and hold down
the delete key

421
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,400
because

422
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,539
if you don't whole down all

423
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,640
if you don't get rid of the Noles then
what happens is

424
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,330
your Purolator wall actually

425
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,350
open the file thinks that it is a PRL

426
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,669
that bit him dumps the file out in this
kind have

427
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,970
reads it out with memory and it just

428
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,390
reads the memory locations and it reads
everything that send them

429
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,409
and so the PRL actually isn't you know
that's

430
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:32,659
that's a subset the memory address range
that

431
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:35,950
tops since it's just taking a memory
address range near

432
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,970
while so that answer

433
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,030
you know having a lot of weird crap

434
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,820
getting after that spurred into the
phone pitched

435
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,530
appear itself and then you've got all
these girls but

436
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:57,350
were almost while shed

437
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,990
yeah hoops I yes that's something that
sucks because

438
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:07,179
a look at that I so I did this a few
times

439
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,400
when I was starting to do this and said
oh god damnit

440
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,200
and went through and did this again like
many times and I'm not gonna do that now

441
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,400
because I have

442
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,600
a handy-dandy copia me

443
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,799
file that ivory done this so I mean if
you want I'll do it again just to prove

444
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:24,280
I'm

445
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,190
line to you in a really does work well I
guess I got time

446
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:34,130
it's it's up to you guys how much you in
a time okay we're fine okay

447
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,159
in that case pilots coach you RPR a
letter and

448
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,450
oh yeah that's something that I have in
my like happy fun

449
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:49,320
directory while

450
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,178
now

451
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,530
Bell either

452
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:04,120
that's used yessir answer stroll that
works

453
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,690
installed the idea

454
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:13,280
I don't like this one as much as the
Nokia Purolator

455
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,820
K I only Kyocera phone

456
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,909
this was available for download on a
public website

457
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,310
I do not think this is a copyright
violation it all

458
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,450
if it is you know Kyocera any rate any

459
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,380
you sir raps here is there anyone from
CSA rehear

460
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,550
who can tell me whether I'm violating
the copywriter once Tommy two seasons

461
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:41,000
test now okay

462
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,100
alright so I assume we're fine then
we're gonna take a look at one double

463
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,080
issue for

464
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,919
that is the current pero

465
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,510
for spread and its PRL

466
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,740
and know what this you know it's kinda

467
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,860
few here where you can actually go and
like

468
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,040
again in this read format

469
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,159
or a few white conduct to a text file

470
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,780
which is normal as

471
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,840
that that you can easily important cell
thats

472
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,250
fun Excel macros right change between

473
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:23,580
girls which is really what people care
about what changed between the last PRL

474
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,250
on the new one what's what's the news
stop which systems got taken away which

475
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,380
new ones good

476
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,590
what it's pretty with digital roaming
thats

477
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,850
usually the biggest concerns did did
they take away our digital roaming

478
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:39,730
I can I sensor sometimes there's

479
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,430
offer or did they take away US Cellular
running in the case of a rise in around

480
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,720
a year ago they had this

481
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,240
weird on-again off-again relationship
with US Cellular

482
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,640
and US Cellular is just a huge carrier
in the Pacific Northwest geographically

483
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,740
use to the Cascade Range they cover
pretty much everything except for one

484
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,320
little child

485
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,200
in sailor rounds and so they Verizon has
a roaming agreement

486
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,420
spread and they had this have this
roaming agreement with US Cellular

487
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,130
but whether you could Rome on US
Cellular for free was just this

488
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,140
odd variable would fluctuate wildly

489
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,600
like one pero you could the other pero
you couldn't and of course the PRL the

490
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,800
same control what you get bill that saw
its own

491
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,350
billing system but you have to assume
the uranium dole based on what the PRL

492
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,030
says

493
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:30,230
so it's the you know it's always in you
know I'm not variables

494
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,020
normally what people care about here is
is what's in the pure

495
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,420
well as you can see you betta and

496
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,580
me copy this to text files what size

497
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:48,530
apps since here

498
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,500
oh no that doesn't work in the Kyocera
PST

499
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:58,500
like you actually have to select the
thing and scroll to the bottom

500
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,740
are no no the bureau letters chin Eric
actually act I don't like users as much

501
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,080
as

502
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,080
years week scan

503
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,649
missile better with work page where

504
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,570
somewhere visible okay

505
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,299
good accepted yet

506
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:25,110
well yes

507
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:32,110
Korea rise

508
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,250
every

509
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,600
bach yeah an hour weird anymore okay
good so I you've got an acquisition

510
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,140
table

511
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,550
and with the acquisition table is is
affectively an index number and the

512
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:43,889
other

513
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:47,460
Texas law but thats the price we pay for
me read this

514
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,690
and out I'm just gonna scroll through
because Austria works

515
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,850
for entry 0

516
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:57,890
the system ideas 4106 yet this is

517
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,170
or here since

518
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:08,170
much the formatting the system ID's 4106

519
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,580
the NED all its see if I can get to is
this more visible

520
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:18,150
on the side okay the net is nearly
always 655 35 you don't need to worry

521
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:18,870
about that

522
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,360
on negative and preferred column is is
this a preferred

523
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,390
roaming partner or is this somebody
Carolina at all

524
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,030
in sprints case is that singular or is
it

525
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,410
generally singular is that

526
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,530
preferred the geography I

527
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:42,090
that defines the you produce put up a
geography because you've got

528
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:46,810
numerous geography senior PRL and then
you scan through the geographies

529
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,280
for each priority

530
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,710
order and then so you go geography

531
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:57,000
scan across geographies and across
priorities

532
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,010
so in the last yager fee at the lowest
priority that's last against you

533
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,300
and the goal they re is to try to find
Quercus

534
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,330
find your service as quickly as possible
on

535
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,069
priority is designates

536
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,610
is at the same geography or sit in new
geography

537
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,890
and which years prioritize more about
the other

538
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:25,710
depending on the context so

539
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,720
we've got an acquisition

540
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,250
for index number 39 our acquisition
indexes 37

541
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,730
answer for 37 and

542
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,940
that generally that that means digitally
and be

543
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,000
but if you scan across here you can see
with that

544
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,800
its generic sawyer sailor channel one

545
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,070
spool and and for

546
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:54,760
acquisition index for is amps see

547
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,480
digital and analog cellular list example
here

548
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,920
and nearly in nearly all cases for
cellular carriers

549
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,840
you can have an entry that looks like
this said you'll have

550
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,510
an acquisition X 37 which is traditional
CDMA

551
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:14,160
have a secondary second acquisition
index for which is for analog CDMA

552
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,200
that one is a little weird cuz if
digital

553
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:24,030
all this acquisition and X 37 will start
out with digital and failover to analog

554
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,510
at that site available so sry done and
it took me a long time to figure out why

555
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,280
in the world sprint was duplicating

556
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,290
s ants as it turns out

557
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:36,390
you can specify a analog only

558
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:41,160
and so if you specify analog only what
it will do is it'll go to this

559
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,470
acquisition index for rather than
acquisition X 37 for the running partner

560
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,250
the area unless you take all the
acquisition index

561
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,420
forceout and then it'll go to 37
failover to analyze but it takes longer

562
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,170
to pick up the carriers so that's

563
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,450
Weiss protests that on and the rum
indicator is zero

564
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,890
and that means that on my phone it will
say that it's running

565
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:06,430
verses one which is not running

566
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,799
and actually that's the that's useful
one other purpose

567
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,480
sprints firmware will scan only sprint
systems

568
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,410
if you said your phone to spring that
then it will only pick up these carriers

569
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:24,259
through Medicare 1 so if you've got
different acquisition and excess than 37

570
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,930
for usually that means it's PCS spans
those are in the nineteen hundred

571
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,850
strange

572
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,620
so this is what a PR looks like but it's
pretty raw

573
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:38,480
I mean what the hell is said 1506 that
doesn't on

574
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,620
so that's where we get to you

575
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:48,620
the interpretations time

576
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:02,359
and just a lurker uses the same format
because I stole his

577
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:08,069
on it was a good format I have made a
lot of changes to his data

578
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:11,690
he also had an automated means
generating this stuff

579
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,880
and I am both too lazy and too stupid to
get this into a database where I can

580
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,950
automatically

581
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,549
export this is Jackson dollar-something
have a

582
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:25,730
fun said transforms that makes pages
automatically

583
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:28,980
gets this thing out like five minutes
after you arrowheads

584
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,559
but someday people smarter than he will
help me do this

585
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:37,339
and it'll be a lot faster for now it's a
lot a manual cut and paste in

586
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,470
research and so forth the changes I've
made our

587
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,779
on there were a lot errors in the
underlying data

588
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:47,309
he was using and people who

589
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:52,579
told work for so you learn carriers have
been kind enough to

590
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:55,589
help correct some of this day

591
00:37:55,589 --> 00:38:00,109
and give me really accurate data that
looks remarkably like it came out at

592
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:02,089
carrier databases or something but

593
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:06,308
you know it who am I to complain because
I don't know what the sources

594
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:09,460
on so

595
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,720
this is little more readable a this is
one option the current pyara looks like

596
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,809
and as you can see

597
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:18,319
when you turn on your phone the first
thing that it looks for sprint in Boston

598
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:19,170
for

599
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,730
whatever reason arbitrarily and then it
looks for spring

600
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,450
New York Philadelphia then if you can't
find that

601
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,920
and remember little search across all
the geographies and

602
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,960
by one before catsup right to will
scroll down within

603
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,220
northeast geography and see what users
on

604
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,910
and it'll you you know you sir so what
does this mean

605
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,420
what is one of these entries new guys
read this

606
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,299
said too small civilian

607
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:50,740
crank up the text size some little
better

608
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,670
okay good

609
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,920
okay good so well that's the best I can
do it that by

610
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,320
set two largest try to use accessible

611
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,250
years its summer the time I'm so

612
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:13,380
priority one you know thus the first
entry is the system I T 4106

613
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,530
PCS indicates that it's scanning the PCS
bans

614
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,090
I'll the Doubletree in dash

615
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:24,440
means that that's a an area that you're
roaming in

616
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,770
us yunus obviously Sprint PCS Boston
just means this

617
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,850
this is where this system ID lives and
then scan 500

618
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,000
the 600 be blah blah blah that years

619
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,060
a breakout up the acquisition and Dax

620
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,220
that in the PRL corresponds with the
system

621
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,820
and so for pride to you can't see

622
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,490
you know use US Cellular wide no
surprise there

623
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,630
analog roaming is cheap in crappy and

624
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,710
more US Cellular inevitable rise and

625
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,320
and at it a is analog

626
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,800
TA is digital analog obviously RM

627
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,810
means roaming these 224

628
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,779
a for Bangor Maine process and all the
way down what those are

629
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:20,430
is that's the cellular market area as
defined by the FCC the wrong number and

630
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,990
then FCC database

631
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:25,440
and a means that it's scanning on the
east side side

632
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,320
license so I don't know what all these
are

633
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,420
you know 1620 is a an example that
something right don't know which sailor

634
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,240
market area

635
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,260
horns tail Pennsylvania corresponds

636
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,500
actually that's been text except have
said but so it's out on the lives

637
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,830
but its site my copy so

638
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:50,160
anyhow if you wanna walk through this on
your own

639
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,859
I'll give you the URL at the end site

640
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,300
area copy of this and the presentation

641
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,880
there today I'm but

642
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,290
this is the end product I few what to
see a demo of actually

643
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:10,550
editing a PRL on would you guys like to
see

644
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,720
how a PRL could be edited okay

645
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:19,260
I am so we'll go back into the Kyocera
PST

646
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,250
I'm not gonna put this one on my phone
because I don't know

647
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,480
walls here or whether this is illegal so

648
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,940
you know I'm not gonna commit
potentially a federal crime in front of

649
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,930
hundreds of people

650
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:35,000
but I'll show you how you could added a
PRL

651
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,040
you know what you might change in wait a
minute sir

652
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,130
Kyocera PST is weird runs this server
and then

653
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,640
you have all these weird clay utilities

654
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:56,640
day connect to the server here phone so
we'll go back

655
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:06,030
okay so we have a PRL and

656
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:18,480
system ID six is for rise in wireless

657
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,119
in Washington State

658
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,760
today not opens

659
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,010
did not open this you know what a minute
to use this

660
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:45,010
one stats that one that's is

661
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,380
very

662
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,630
much better

663
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,400
so this once a little less friendly but
I like

664
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:13,400
speakers make which record number

665
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:24,180
we'll see this sec

666
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:48,839
okay good so go 2-1 us so what I was
looking for was which record

667
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,080
is there this is the acquisition tables

668
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,870
if you wanted ad acquisition tables good
us

669
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,980
must say that I want to create a news

670
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:06,980
entry for AT&T Wireless

671
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,540
we will add

672
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:18,180
said so 47 and it's a preferred system

673
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:25,180
and its geography is the same as the
previous region

674
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:31,050
priority is higher than tax and the
acquisition index

675
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:38,050
sport because this is analog bingo

676
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,919
now I have a PRL that I could load into
my phone and AT&T Wireless is now

677
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,130
preferred over for ice and wireless in
the pacific northwest

678
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,010
Sprint has a roaming agreement with AT&T
Wireless there

679
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:59,410
and I entered the system ID war

680
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,609
Washington State western Washington

681
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:07,030
particular AT&T Wireless and so if I put
my phone ever to roaming

682
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,350
with that file in it was in Seattle
instead of picking up

683
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,920
John James Earl Jones whoever the heck
is

684
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,920
same Darth Vader rising Wireless said
I'd actually get AT&T Wireless

685
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,530
and be able to use their better analyze
coverage rise in satellite coverage for

686
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:28,570
busts worst I've ever seen so I've got
around

687
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:32,930
three minutes for questions like us on
if anyone has questions

688
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:39,930
yeah you have a question

689
00:45:54,089 --> 00:45:56,680
that's a terrific question because
Virgin Mobile

690
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,749
is a prepaid service that uses Sprint's
network

691
00:45:59,749 --> 00:46:04,069
on remember it doesn't matter what's in
your PRL

692
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:07,479
if there's not an arrangement on the
back end for you to be a actually be

693
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:08,759
able to use that service

694
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:13,549
so if you when Annu remove the negative
roaming entries for singular

695
00:46:13,549 --> 00:46:17,680
for instance you know we don't have
singular analog in the northwest side

696
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,799
never tested this Mike gases the you
would actually be able to roam one

697
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:22,460
singular

698
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,630
places you never should be able to if
you did that on

699
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:29,410
if you have Sprint non prepaid service
postpaid

700
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,879
Virgin Mobile on the other hand you can
only use Sprint's network

701
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,049
they don't have any roaming agreements
with anybody its all walked in the

702
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:36,999
billing systems

703
00:46:36,999 --> 00:46:42,130
so arm aside from the fact that they're
from one's life but

704
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:46,099
you know I'll tell you this much I've
gotten around that iPad pron there

705
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:49,509
that you know would be roaming strictly
to see whether

706
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:54,400
I could do it its it doesn't work
because there's just no

707
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,960
roaming the back and said any other
questions

708
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,329
yeah have a question had a friend who
had a problem had a legitimate problem

709
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,660
with this Pierre Ellis

710
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,969
got I gets corrupted during over-the-air
download

711
00:47:07,969 --> 00:47:13,999
and the the tier 3 tech support person
told me that it's the subscribers

712
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,609
responsibility to manually download

713
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:21,130
PRL monthly on Verizon you heard
anything about this before

714
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:26,299
Verizon's infamous for you know they
have such nice customer service people

715
00:47:26,299 --> 00:47:27,269
there at their

716
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:30,180
a lot of them are in Bellevue Washington
right down the street from where I live

717
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,089
actually in

718
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:35,940
there you know they're so nice and they
just make up

719
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,249
the most interesting things to tell
their customers I've just heard the most

720
00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:45,039
bus are things ever I'm you they want
you to update your PRL all the time of

721
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:45,999
course because

722
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:49,279
they're they're changing it around in
order to save them money on roaming

723
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:51,119
agreements and of course they want you

724
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,200
star 228 like completely wreck your
coverage

725
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,489
given areas because it costs them last
but

726
00:47:57,489 --> 00:48:00,509
no its not your responsibility down

727
00:48:00,509 --> 00:48:05,579
monthly its its it's your responsibility
to do that if you wanna PRL

728
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:09,269
you know you look at each parl and you
see for what are the advantages and

729
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:10,410
disadvantages about

730
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:14,598
and you way for somebody wake you're
just a lurker

731
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,460
any the no radio any the guys who do
this

732
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,400
and you see whether whether apparel
update is something that makes sense

733
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,900
given where you live in

734
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:29,680
travel what as far as

735
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,660
phones that are easiest to utilize this
technique on what ones

736
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,359
are most at most the work done on in a

737
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:43,328
as a follow-up to that is there been any
work done on the PC cards for

738
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:47,339
data services %uh the Orinoco PC cards

739
00:48:47,339 --> 00:48:50,430
can only be used on that carriers system
actually

740
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:56,469
they have a special Caroline them as I
understand it that only works with

741
00:48:56,469 --> 00:49:00,859
document carrier and it didn't make
sense there's no unlike on the GSM side

742
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:04,098
there's generally no data roaming
agreements on CDMA

743
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:08,059
it's for voice only what's easiest

744
00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:11,519
oh not a family's I have yes sir I and

745
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,369
Sanyo handsets hands had good success

746
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,849
yeah looks like a man to be thrown off
the stage

747
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:22,410
if I don't get off so I can its yet

748
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,788
so it well I'm finish with the question
but I would like to tell you the

749
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:33,789
site where these things now that is here

750
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,830
yep

751
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:48,619
yeah let's do that there could you tell
me click

752
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:52,790
how do you find out which system I these
correspond to what I carrier in one

753
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:53,430
location

754
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,850
harm I can't tell you that really quick

755
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:00,490
but my email address is T profit at T
profit .org

756
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:04,300
and you are welcome to correspond with
me privately I'll be more than pleased

757
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,240
to tell you

758
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,850
how to do this or you can look at just a
lurker dot com

759
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:13,190
and he has a great walk through how he
does it for four I sent and

760
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:16,790
that's a great place to start actually
because then you can ask specific

761
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:17,450
questions

762
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,810
thanks guys
