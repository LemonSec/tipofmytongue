1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,089
people like scott ritter head of
intelligence during the

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,799
weapons inspections from 91 to 98 third

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,360
Knoll weapons of mass destruction hines
blacks the new UN inspector goes on

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,988
Thursday

5
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:17,800
no weapons of mass destruction 2hd

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,010
she told him to his face we will not
hesitate to discredit

7
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,180
you with a real intelligence failures
may lie

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,630
elsewhere Physicians for Social
Responsibility got a hold of some

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,610
documents about a year ago

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,010
after long litigation against dick
cheese

11
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,929
energy Task Force much of which is still
going on i dun wanna sign in hand over

12
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:43,390
any of those papers

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,670
bush in cells that last April a country
that hide something is a country that is

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,120
afraid of getting caught

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,559
well that's why Chini won't hand over
the papers boy turned up in the papers

16
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,159
that Physicians for Social
Responsibility did get

17
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,579
well from the Chi ni energy task force
you know after that

18
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,719
California energy crisis that was
created in part by an Ron turning off

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,430
the faucet

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,570
anyway she had the task force had

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,800
a map %uh iraqi oilfields

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,620
pipelines terminals and refineries

23
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,880
accompanied by a list of potential
buyers

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,360
once we seized their country

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,720
which may explain why they were so
asleep

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,020
at the wheel around september 11th

27
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,179
analyst up alone is the worst scandal
than watergate culture dating all the

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,860
reagan gates come by

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,860
let alone monica lewinsky with all the
scandals they they the question is

30
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,030
what did the president know and when did
he know it and the scary part is in this

31
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,250
case the answer is

32
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,970
not main he never hurt me

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,260
anything for intelligence failure first

34
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:59,260
you need intelligence right the 911
hearings the ones on the intelligence

35
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,500
failures alive

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,870
deliberative he asked me in Iraq know
that turn ups

37
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,789
yet they basically portray something
that's not being run like a white house

38
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,830
or something series is like spinal tap

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,490
in a way August 6th the mellow

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,690
shows that condo leave the got kinda
lazy

41
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,700
she said all ya there was no silver
bullet here

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,000
no smoking gun but all it said was bin
Laden is ready to attack the United

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,250
States in a big big

44
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,890
way part of the reason they didn't take
it seriously well for one thing

45
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,270
Bush was on vacation paid only for Texas
how can jam a cation and taxes

46
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,140
namely that battle with a dime bag cut
out in the pages here

47
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,230
can you give me some pretzels well

48
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,010
another reason that they were so asleep
at the wheel to do with not just

49
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,160
obsession with

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,430
staging a fake energy crisis and
conquering iraq

51
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,770
but documents show that the main focus
have Kandace Letha and Rumsfeld

52
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,349
they thought the most important national
security concern for us

53
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,500
hell it's not global warming its lack of
nuclear weapons in outer space

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,319
we must do whatever we can to make way
reagan Star Wars wet dream come true

55
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,330
and put nukes in space conversely the
was scheduled to give a speech on

56
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,500
September 11th

57
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,860
about how desperately we needed nukes in
space for now let's PG course

58
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,150
is classified and the problem with those
weapons ears

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,120
and they said this last time what
happens if they malfunction

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,319
Luca city and then they retaliate in
goal after

61
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,890
us or car though one of those things
comes back down crashes and blows in the

62
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,660
atmosphere like the columbia did or
whatever

63
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,250
there's a nuclear warhead up there forty
fifty thousand pound the plutonium

64
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,599
that's enough plutonium dust too slowly
blow all over our atmosphere

65
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,030
and cause cancer in just about every
breathing crater left

66
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,720
on the planet that scares me a lot more

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,250
the north korea's Saddam Hussein al
Qaeda combined

68
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,250
as crack was asleep at the wheel for
another reason

69
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,180
lobbying Congress at the time to slash
another six hundred million dollars from

70
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,440
the justice department's anti-terrorist

71
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,860
efforts because he wanted to concentrate
everything on the main threat to life as

72
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,050
we know it

73
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,940
hard not graffiti you may call it your
Eagle four by looking at that

74
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,949
were not graffiti that was the real

75
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,820
intelligence failure and they quietly
announced in February 02

76
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,430
that Star Wars is on fast-track

77
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,760
now tho many broadcasts have failed

78
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,650
let's is put him up there anyway and
hope that they work

79
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,710
that's what I call intelligence failure

80
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,659
and bra follow two leaders have Germany
and France and the other countries

81
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,660
who refused to go along with bullish and
help invade Iraq

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,699
never did I think I'd have a single good
thing to say about jacques sure lack

83
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:22,169
who in his own country is nicknamed
super crock

84
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,820
among other things but this time he did
the right thing

85
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,669
what do you wanna bet one of the main
reasons these folks did the right thing

86
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:30,320
in this

87
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,060
this case is because there were so many
protesters in the streets in their

88
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
country

89
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,419
urging them not to get caught with their
pants down licking bush

90
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:44,080
this time around and

91
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,020
thats to I was gonna say anyway

92
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,020
you may recall that colin powell was the
one who drew the short straw on had to

93
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,900
walk the plank and go to the united
nations and say that

94
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,210
up while we know there's 100 to 500
tonnes

95
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,840
of weapons of mass destruction here's
your photographic proof

96
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,080
which to anybody else look like a blurry
aerial photo of a Walmart under

97
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,440
construction in the desert somewhere

98
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,699
but this is different it had words with
arrows pointing to various parts of the

99
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:17,460
building

100
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,870
what more proof do you need a track on
the ground what does

101
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,530
back tell you and hey not only that

102
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,990
but I we I got this the this information
on impeachable source

103
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,479
Tony Blair would he lie to you

104
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,570
well apparently he dead cuz is top
secret information was swiped directly

105
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,740
off the net

106
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,060
in another instance love government
hacktivism by the powerful against the

107
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,130
powers

108
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,449
where was the paper put up by somebody
at the University of California

109
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,910
California State University Monterey

110
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,520
they went public and said you know if
the guy just come and talk to me

111
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,359
I could have given in current
information those weapons totals in

112
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,930
there from 1991

113
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,600
and all but no matter Blair said that

114
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,729
hit saddam hussein could strike %uh
shuttles with

115
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,508
nuclear week enough 45

116
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,110
limits okay

117
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,750
the excuses were getting really creative
artistic

118
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,729
even by then in our country to we're
saying that saddam hussein was hiding

119
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,250
all is nuclear weapons in anthrax labs
and trucks

120
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,870
driving up and down the pockmarked
highways the Iraq

121
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:38,870
I haven't heard of hiding in New clap in
a semi since get smart

122
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,500
and then we said oh he's building a
fleet have

123
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,940
unmanned aircraft drone planes they
could be used for actions targeting the

124
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,289
United States

125
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,219
at the somehow remote control plane
could make it into the no fly zone

126
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,930
across Turkey across Europe across the
Atlantic and crash into the Oval Office

127
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,300
with nobody noticing

128
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,280
no problem running out of fuel well they
did flying

129
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,500
and draw one drone plane in Iraq bout so
big

130
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,080
propeller powered fuselages made in part
out of balsa wood

131
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,150
held together in part with duct tape

132
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,600
well what if players right

133
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,069
keep your eye on the sky especially
around the time the Republican

134
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:23,990
convention

135
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,310
and if you see a propeller plane coming
slowly towards you

136
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,339
with Paul Fussell I have balls the word
and a nuclear bomb held on with duct

137
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:34,169
tape

138
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,399
you have 45 minutes to go to anyone to
billions of greasy fast food restaurants

139
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,380
in this town

140
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,950
cover yourself with Crisco role in the
cornflake crumbs and fake

141
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,950
okay Colonel Sanders I'm ready from

142
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,840
email

143
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,840
because they fail for the nuclear
argument and maybe they thought there

144
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,310
was money in it I don't know but
congress fell for John Kerry fell for it

145
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,260
but

146
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,720
I've had trouble personally with
photographic proof for many years

147
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,110
specially after I went to the republican
convention to cause some trouble in

148
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,860
Philadelphia in 2000

149
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,410
and detoured into the third up detoured
into this little exhibit hall that had a

150
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,949
feel-good exhibit for all the peasants
who couldn't get into the convention

151
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,970
history of conventions past with first
ladies footwear underclassmen

152
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,890
coffee-table books about bush's dad and
even there

153
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,390
dog for sale and then write down from
there

154
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,560
there's a photo booth we could go in get
your picture taken

155
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,380
put in Photoshop monkey around with it
for a minute and I would come a glossy

156
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,730
photograph a view hanging out with
George W Bush

157
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,360
and it looked hold a lead real

158
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,020
which makes me wonder how many have the

159
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,650
news photos we see in papers and on the
net

160
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,069
and even how much footage we see on
television

161
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:10,200
is not real if it's back easy to
manipulate it these days

162
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,810
plan any other examples you know like
the

163
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,830
up the report on golf don't get america
drawn in the Gulf or number one that

164
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,610
saddam hussein savage army was storming
hospitals in Kuwait and dumping

165
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,240
premature babies out of incubators in

166
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,150
leaving a little babies to die on the
floor as they made offer the hospital

167
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,860
equipment

168
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,870
and then they trotted out a seemingly
shell-shocked young kuwaiti woman to

169
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,140
testify before Congress and that's the
cameras as well

170
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,090
we could do to wonder why contre please
for Merkel

171
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,280
soon leave kuwait for democracy

172
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,829
turned out story planted

173
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,850
woman hired by the hill in alternate
agency

174
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,200
who were employed by the kuwaiti royal
family

175
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,770
to use their PR prowess to wag the dog
in this country

176
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,010
and convince Americans that is was in
our best interest to launch a full-scale

177
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:09,840
war in the Middle Eastern country hardly
anybody even knew existed

178
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,680
just to put them on the throne democracy
be damned

179
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,160
and it turned out the little girl was
the daughter the Kuwaiti ambassador to

180
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,439
the United States

181
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,490
one example Gulf of Tonkin incident

182
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,410
even worse 1964 splattered all over the
corporate media

183
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,189
North Vietnamese gunboats fired on
american ships in the Gulf of Tonkin

184
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,580
now was all it took for lyndon johnson
to ram through

185
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,540
the yard Gulf of Tonkin Resolution again
congress just like the Patriot Act be

186
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,300
afraid of being labeled soft on
communism

187
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,440
only one senator at the spine to vote
against it could blame them

188
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,120
vietnam war is on what a bad guess
almost 60,000 Americans dead

189
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,710
many more including some you know maybe
were maimed and scarred for life

190
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:03,510
death toll again over their estimated
between one and two million vietnamese

191
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,790
we still haven't cleaned up the agent
orange over there that's making people

192
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,959
sick and having

193
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,790
birth defects in all and now corporate
media just shrug their shoulders and

194
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,520
acknowledges though it's no big deal the
Gulf of Tonkin incident never happened

195
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,790
thanks for telling us now and

196
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:28,790
fast forward to the feel-good Rob Rob
war patriotic tale

197
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,110
%uh Jessica Lynch hyped as the first P O
W rescue since world war two

198
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,330
poor Jessica her homer got shot up for
whatever they choose pumped full of

199
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:40,910
holes

200
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,810
then stabbed by iraqi troops and then
for some weird reason they took her to

201
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,410
the hospital

202
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,860
anyway but American commandos stormed
the hospital

203
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,120
spot of saddam hussein's elite
Revolutionary Guard

204
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,860
and West poor Jessica back to safety

205
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,070
a great feel-good isn't were wonderful
stories I've ever heard one

206
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,940
trouble is she even admitted on diane
sawyer

207
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,920
when her TV movie and the book she got a
million bucks in advance for all the

208
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,450
ghost writer towpath

209
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,510
came out the same week she admitted

210
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,540
that never happened no

211
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,770
she got hurt cuz her homer overturned

212
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,790
and the people in the hospital who tried
to get the Americans they had her

213
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:29,050
tried to thank her back to the Americans
in an ambulance which got fired on so

214
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,020
they had to turn around and go back

215
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,010
and that there were no Iraqi soldiers in
the hospital at all

216
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,410
they just came along firing blanks with
cameras

217
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,180
piped immediately to the pentagon media
area in Qatar

218
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,150
alcott I rather and then the over to us

219
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,990
over here is the feel-good story the
dramatic live-action footage rescue

220
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,630
have Jessica Lynch diane sawyer trying
to rescue the live in said but

221
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,120
but why you

222
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,900
really picked I don't recall

223
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,450
anything like that well that means you
could have been

224
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,480
couldn't you anything to hang

225
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,480
onto the lie which makes me wonder

226
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,440
with that going on to saddam hussein
even exist

227
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,250
though some have been lightly even exist
we never found him not yet anyway

228
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,280
and they all said saddam had all these
double so who did they really pull out

229
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,550
on the spider hole

230
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,730
with a big ol beard looking like abbie
hoffman on really bad drugs

231
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,970
in all over again looped on corporate
news see we caught the DOM

232
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,040
we're looking at is keep we look at his
teeth overall regular looking at deep

233
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,709
please please there's gonna be 500 tons
of weapons of mass destruction

234
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:54,370
hud

235
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:59,010
Brian he now has a very good term for
this pointing out that our corporate

236
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,839
media these days and it's

237
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,720
place in controlling society in ages
propaganda anymore its

238
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,180
proper Shanda not just controlling what
we think

239
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,660
but what we think about

240
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,189
Iraq war a complete disaster that will
pay for the rest of our lives

241
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,100
no no no what you've really got to be
worried about its big ass

242
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,130
terrorist acts like Janet Jackson's to
be any

243
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,830
oh my god what are we gonna do about
janet jackson stated

244
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,459
oh my god with Martha Stewart go to jail
instead have

245
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:39,459
oh my god why isn't it sheen jail

246
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,700
was supposed to be you're worried about
it is who's gonna get fired by Donald

247
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,830
Trump

248
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,690
instead of who should be fired in
washington

249
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,870
the well it's perhaps to be worrying
about

250
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,920
his watch while those hale's after holes
after hose

251
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,190
groveling before those sleepy judges on
American Idol

252
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,300
will finally get crowned queen or king

253
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,790
can get to roll the world singing my
worst music I have

254
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,199
hammer heard the

255
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:22,200
and the morning light guard

256
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,660
Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 911 we can't
have that

257
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,819
its slanted its propaganda

258
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,010
you want propaganda look at any
corporate news channel you want

259
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:41,540
as to how they're covering the election
this time around never have I seen

260
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,120
such open biased towards one candidate
over the other

261
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,310
as if carey is some huge threat to their
corporate

262
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,650
order every little thing Carey third

263
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:58,240

but dumb stuff Bush says they just let

264
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
him slide

265
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,620
am going to extend checkout care

266
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,800
even to douse you don't have children
nobody call them on it

267
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,629
to go or in the second debate live TV

268
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,130
your tracking acts out as a carrot I get
some kind a federal program

269
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,850
which it is there was the USA today
saying but

270
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:25,179
will go rub called appeared better
informed on the issues but bush quote

271
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,710
appeared more likable appeared

272
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,720
more likable therefore he won

273
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,850
that's the way they fled like Howard
Dean yells one flight the frat boy years

274
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,969
and they just pummel him with that bush

275
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,280

closed doors with him I have this vision

276
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,350
that the lead kept me awake at night

277
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,800
a bush running around in the War Room or
loose on the grounds of camp david with

278
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,600
T shirt pulled up over his head

language about our president

285
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,430
in public people are calling bush

286
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,790

288
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,919
himself from it

289
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,220
supplying into the corporate media thing
that artists should not

290
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,880
be political it's not an are displaced
to be political

291

he's called people who'd criticizes
movie in any way Passion of the Christ

297
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,020
satanic and one right i think is from
the new yorker he said he wanted the

298
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,340
skin him alive

299
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,449
and he wanted to kill his dog how lack
is that

300
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,560
me know I can say about males movie is I
can hardly wait for the action figures

301
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,909
yeah

302
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,390
most openly bi if the election in my
lifetime

303
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,840
blood scarier still is the stuff they
don't

304
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,899
tell us you know as far as i'm
concerned. corporate media deliberately

305
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,120
under-reporting or deliberately planning
a story

306
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,230
or forgetting to tell anybody the store
even happened is the worst form a

307
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,180
censorship

308
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:47,180
going on in the world today for example

309
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,700
it shouldn't have been almost three
years later the people had to find out

310
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,220
from a Michael Moore movie

311
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,460
about the Saudi airliner we lead into
our supposedly well guarded airspace

312
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,110
after September 11th

313
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,440
to pick up all these members have the
bin Laden family

314
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,080
and other saudi money bags and get them
back safely home

315
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,240
before the FBI could talk to them or

316
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,770
the one from August 23rd 2003

317
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,850
in a British newspaper called The
Guardian

318
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,160
you know the best newspaper I found in
the English language that the daily

319
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,630
paper and everything

320
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,190
amazing how much more actual news
coverage you get outside this country

321
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,640
even in Canada

322
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,000
then you do here you know Morris more
in-depth reporting more sides to the

323
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,410
story presented

324
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:38,790
Guardian you can read it Guardian .co.uk
by the way

325
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,300
and among their many mind-blowing
stories with you August 23rd 2003

326
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,500
reporter named Rory McCarthy wrote a
piece saying

327
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,120
the George W Bush and Pervez Musharraf
the dictator Pakistan

328
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,320
had reached a little understanding with
each other not to see

329
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,370
or kill Osama bin Laden

330
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,010
to let him walk and frolic in the words
or whatever

331
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,210
and the reason cited in the article was
fear that there would be such a bad

332
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,210
backlash if he got

333
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,870
captured or killed with Pakistani
involvement that Musharraf would fall

334
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,770
and possibly be replaced by Taliban
types many from where the Pakistani

335
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,710
armed

336
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,410
forces but obviously another reason to

337
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,670
why pick up been lied now when

338
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,679
carry might be leading in the fall and
you can pick him up october fifteenth

339
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,400
if bush's than any real trouble expect
to be allowed me to magically

340
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,740
up here never mind all that what we need

341
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,090
is regime change regime change

342
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,090
you know another was little lovely buzz
phrases I never heard before he went

343
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,209
into iraq

344
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,350
before that but don't other countries
need a regime change to

345
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,230
you know why that guy why not Saudi
Arabia

346
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:05,179
why not China why not israel right at
the united states to

347
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:11,600
the

348
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,370
and by that I don't mean taking out
corporate oi

349
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,880
number one and replacing him with
corporate or eight number two in the

350
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,440
former John Kerry

351
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,730
and expecting everything to magically
embryo

352
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,860
I mean bulldozing all those corporate
profits of the nearest cliff

353
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,280
into the sea and replacing them with
true patriotic Americans

354
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,910
will give a damn about this country and
the environment and other people in

355
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,010
other countries

356
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,530
and are more interested in doing what
needs to be done in doing the right

357
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,418
thing

358
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:52,010
then piling up brownie points so they
can get on Boeing's Board of Directors

359
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:58,840
when they leave office for some like
crap

360
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,360
again my memory goes back far enough to
win there what is the difference between

361
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,630
the Democratic and Republican Party

362
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,210
b-sides gay rights and abortion and the
people

363
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,970
who ran for office were more interested
in leadership

364
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,169
then deal-making and all back

365
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:19,060
we have to go after saddam hussein I
time do this once on scene and was

366
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,030
cocked his head god's little smirk

367
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,700
Sam Lee Sang is an evil man

368
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,890
no argument there I'm glad we don't live
in a country run by somebody like that

369
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,900
or none of us would be around to attend
this conference today

370
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,790
but saddam hussein was the same evil man

371
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:42,159
he was throughout the last decade when
he didn't attack us or as neighbors

372
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,450
and the same evil mandy was throughout
the nineteen eighties

373
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,390
when we couldn't sell him enough weapons
of mass destruction

374
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,790
are golden boy a we pride and paid the
prior to war

375
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,470
against the ayatollah to make sure that
the ayatollahs fundamentalism didn't

376
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,330
spread to Saudi Arabia

377
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,270
you know we supplied him with all kinds
the weapons intelligence

378
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,360
all kinds of fertilizers and chemicals
we knew he was going to use two gases

379
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,530
own people and even after he started
doing it week supplied with the more

380
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,100
and guess who went to Iraq in 1983

381
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,770
to shake saddam's hand in front of the
cameras to seal the deal that he was our

382
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,650
new special ally in the Middle East

383
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,830
Donald look rumsfeld

384
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,158
yeah that's why saddam says you put me
on trial

385
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,419
I'm calling rumsfeld as a witness

386
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,560
see if they report bad on CNN and you
know what Rumsfeld gave him as a token

387
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,360
of our appreciation

388
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,679
a pair of golden sprayers

389
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,890
saddam with our golden boy to the point
where he fell perfectly comfortable

390
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,130
notifying us in advance

391
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:57,100
he was going to invade kuwait and what
our ambassador april glaspie do but

392
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,350
write a bad thing

393
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,400
we have no opinion on your border
disputes with other countries

394
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,000
com on an that was lower

395
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,470
only by saddam hussein at the time and
is this totally

396
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,419
about oil I think there may be more to
it than that

397
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:17,530
some of you may know a publication
called Harper's

398
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,770
magazine that in the first

399
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,020
firstly pages of either the page called
Harper's index

400
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,050
with all these mind-blowing facts &
figures and statistics

401
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,230
and all and one other man about mayor so
a 2002

402
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,350
really blew my mind it fared

403
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,980
amount we spend every year in this
before the war

404
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,610
guarding our oil supply in the persian
gulf

405
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,490
50 billion dollars

406
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,399
value love the crude coming from the
Gulf that we actually use in this

407
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:52,350
country

408
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,090
ninety to be. billion dollars

409
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,340
what is wrong with this picture
especially when

410
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,630
the whole time you're telling everybody
else in the world don't you dare by any

411
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,340
of saddam

412
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,210
oil cuz that the sanctions we were
buying two-thirds as oil

413
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,169
and the only reason he could pump it out
on the ground wealthy paid $28 billion

414
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:11,870
dollars

415
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,140
to a company called Halliburton to
rebuild his

416
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,169
oil infrastructure Halliburton at that
time

417
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:22,010
run by a guy named dick Chini

418
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,629
what it really boils down to I think is
the curse

419
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,810
of the Wolfman

420
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:34,639
gerd unexplained there was a document
that's been fairly widely documented now

421
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,020
1991 commission by bush's dad called

422
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,350
the national security guidelines

423
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,500
and its authors were Paul Wolfowitz a
chickenhawk

424
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,540
and Lewis Libby another chickenhawk
whose nickname is scooter

425
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,580
and they came back with this document
that was so wildly paranoid

426
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,178
it said that now that there's no more
nuclear threat from the soviet from the

427
00:26:58,179 --> 00:26:59,929
evil empire has collapsed

428
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:04,169
the world is a vastly more dangerous
place

429
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:08,070
and because now we must view all our
allies as quote

430
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,360
potential competitors lead to be
prevented from a quote

431
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,669
aspiring to a greater regional or global
role

432
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,640
then we have in mind for them and it
also said

433
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,720
that US military invasions other country
ish

434
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,460
should be quote a constant feature of
global

435
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,440
affairs even Bush's father thought this
was

436
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,790
in Thane and should have thrown wolfman
scooter in a padded cell right then and

437
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,510
there

438
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,169
but he just made him rewrite it nave
live direct the world again

439
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:47,530
wolfowitz courses now number 22 rumsfeld
than the Defense Department

440
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:51,520
prediction is he's gonna get Rumsfeld's
job if bush gets and again

441
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,889
well scooter is Dick Cheney's Chief of
Staff

442
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,669
when clinton was in power summer the
thugs migrated over to a group called

443
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:03,330
project for a new American Century

444
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,580
in addition to wolf man and scooter
include dick cheney

445
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,689
Donald Rumsfeld jeb bush and another
visionary dan quayle

446
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,740
who are bombarding president clinton
with letters and study thing we must

447
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,090
invade Iraq

448
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:23,390
right now and we should get rid of all
UN peacekeeping missions everywhere

449
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,500
and have american troops do all other
why

450
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,360
well I mean rumsfeld kinda looks like
the guy in Pinky and the brain right

451
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,080
take Armando y other they said that was
okay

452
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,908
and all we needed to jump-start this was
closed a new

453
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:44,669
overall harbor and another thing
factoring into all this

454
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:48,590
is every time we go into that part of
the world we come to visit and decide to

455
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,690
stay

456
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,580
we got military bases now in kuwait
Saudi Arabia although because of all the

457
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,300
problems are slowly moving most to that
the big new one and Katara

458
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,390
got one in Bahrain got one in Oman

459
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,010
got one across from the bomb a Saudi
Arabia crossbar love the red feel a

460
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,870
little country called Djibouti

461
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,169
got a min turkey put them up in Pakistan

462
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:14,130
Afghanistan Halliburton intimately
involved the course

463
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,600
whose back is stan i think to G could
stand as the other one

464
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,390
and were talking about keeping for

465
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,399
tiene military bases in Iraq

466
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:29,730
permanently regardless of whether the
iraqis what as to leave

467
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,040
14 in Guantanamo Bay is regarded with a
buddy wants it or not

468
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,710
why why so much military presence in
that part of the world

469
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,120
effect nineteen billion dollars worth of
crude is only 10 percent

470
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,210
OVR gladness consumption why

471
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,320
unless it's to implement the covers

472
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,939
are the Wolfman hey France

473
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,300
hey Germany k China Japan

474
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,030
you aspire to a greater regional a
global role

475
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:06,370
than we have in mind for you which is
gonna turn the faucet of

476
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,940
because now you don't have to have
Persian Gulf crowed

477
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,570
but we you know that you do and that
means from now on

478
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,908
we've got you in your economies by

479
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:21,750
then nap that's basically what

480
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,250
that means but what about the people who
live there

481
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,330
even Bush's father in his memoirs said
the reason he didn't

482
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,860
your to invade Iraq all the way and try
to occupy the country

483
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,050
he listed all the things that are going
wrong today

484
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,460
busch said well gave the wrong father to
appeal to you

485
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,950
in terms of strength there is a higher
father

486
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,460
that I appeal to well

487
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,280
there so out of it I mean this is the
problem when you rely

488
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,129
on think tank Yahoo's today did conduct
foreign policy

489
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,000
and shaken Hawks to run away or you know
you can memorize all the statistics and

490
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,659
strategies you want

491
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:09,320
but that's no substitute for hanging out
and talking with terrorists or whatever

492
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,850
it's the same as difference between a
baseball fan who knows everybody's

493
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,149
batting average

494
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:19,659
and all these weird statistics and
actually playing on a baseball team

495
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:24,149
dick cheney chickenhawk said when we go
into Iraq

496
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:29,190
I believe we will be greeted as
liberators

497
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,810
we were not greeted as liberators whole
country's going postal

498
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,560
iraqis getting madder and madder that we
ate leaving

499
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,040
and while all carb everything including
ROM I've now noticed

500
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,770
with the big trend over here kidnappings

501
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,679
be headings and bombings are the trend
over there

502
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,890
an already spreading outside iraq

503
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:59,830
as the first sign over worldwide
intifada against

504
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,960
us not just

505
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,080
the bush mob us

506
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,220
that scares me and the last thing we
ever wanted over there was democracy

507
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:18,220
after all our own president wasn't
elected either

508
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,250
and if they did have an election

509
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,370
look who would win at this point

510
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:31,760
whoever wanted to wage the most she hot
against the infidel United States

511
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,060
and that just doesn't go for a racket
goes for the populism

512
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,389
Egypt Saudi Arabia Jordan Kuwait

513
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,830
you name it and here's the real taking
bombers half the population in those

514
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,040
countries

515
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,060
is under 25 and the job growth

516
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,770
in the key economic growth is Neil

517
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,899
basically average Saudi income as

518
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:59,480
been cut by two-thirds downed eight
grand a year while the royal family

519
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,950
makes off with all the money in we
support them

520
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,350
and then bush is saying well I don't
understand why people hate ass

521
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,830
they hate us because they have freedom
know they hate us because we won't let

522
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,080
them have any freedom

523
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,530
that's why they hate us

524
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:24,139
and instead of liberation we seriously
expected to get rid of Saddam and put in

525
00:33:24,139 --> 00:33:25,840
our own saddam

526
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,070
a guy named are committed shalaby who
hadn't set foot in Iraq in 47 years

527
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:35,350
but had wolfman in the neo-cons
convinced

528
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,230
then a huge guerrilla army would rise to
follow him

529
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,550
and eventually managed to round up a
hundred guys before we went in

530
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,540
this guy came from the richest family in
Iraq who had to flee the country in the

531
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,570
late fifties

532
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,869
when he was a teenager and more
importantly he's on the run to this day

533
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:55,859
from a 22-year prison sentence in jordan

534
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:59,659
for ripping anywhere from $30 million
two hundred million bucks

535
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:03,600
out of his own bank that is the
equivalent

536
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,470
have somebody invading this country in
thing now that we've liberated you when

537
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,609
you have your freedom

538
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:12,609
here's your new president his name is
John Dillon Jer

539
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:17,750
basically and even though Chalabi is now
on the outs with the bush people they

540
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,918
figured out he's a con man

541
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,560
took us for $39 million bucks got us
into a war

542
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,580
and with apparently spying for a Rand
the entire time

543
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,299
you know only bush's people could fall
for something like that you know the

544
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,080
real intelligence failure

545
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,879
but Chalabi brother is in charge for
prosecuting saddam hussein's still

546
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:44,569
and shalaby his cousins and relatives
have seized control of the iraqi banking

547
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,580
system

548
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,580
still and then shalaby was merely
supposed to act as a front

549
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,139
for Bramer when he came in any walk CNN
fires

550
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,040
four hundred thousand soldiers replaces
them with

551
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,440
nobody you know it's the soldiers said
shit we still other weapons

552
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,540
we didn't rise up and fight the
Americans and this is the thanks we get

553
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,900
no pay no job no pension

554
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,840
100000 government bureaucrats who kept
the country functioning

555
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,380
fired replaced with nobody

556
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,130
all the cops fired replaced with

557
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,330
nobody no wonder all hell broke loose

558
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,799
basically and the deal with the day
after go for number one

559
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:35,050
according to occupation watch .org which
is a really interesting site to look at

560
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,550
for what's really going on in Iraq and
how iraqi people are really suffering

561
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,170
over there from homelessness

562
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:47,160
disease lack of clean water electricity
still ain't working no jobs no security

563
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,850
crime through the roof women scared to
go outside and

564
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,040
less there's an American television crew
with them to show that everything safe

565
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,890
in all

566
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,779
but up they point out that after goal
for number one

567
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,980
saddam hussein's people had the
electricity in the folds up into two

568
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,310
months

569
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,970
and it's still barely functioning if
it's functioning

570
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:14,830
at all in Iraq and the really obscene
part of this is things are getting done

571
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:18,900
and things aren't working because
they're not supposed to

572
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,510
willie sutton the famous bank robber
once said

573
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,910
use ask why do you rob banks he said
well that's where the money is

574
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,399
that's what's going on in Iraq right now
Brammer when he fired all those people

575
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
also announced

576
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,569
iraq is open for business not iraqi
business

577
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:41,859
not the experts would know how the
electricity grid actually worked

578
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:45,480
that how to deal with the waterworks
might want to guard the facilities

579
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,440
before they got looted right down to
hospital beds

580
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,630
while our troops stood idly by and
Rumsfeld just said

581
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,770
our freedom isn't it. now

582
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,330
they were allowed to have any jobs only
privateers and pirates who work for

583
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,340
companies like Halliburton

584
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,369
and their subsidiary Kellogg Brown &
Root

585
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:09,100
backed all and the rest the one through
a long time ago got in on the gravy

586
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,960
train in the reagan days I've

587
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,090
billing the pentagon three thousand
dollars apiece for screwdrivers

588
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,670
$600 apiece for toilet seats no
questions asked

589
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,109
clinton didn't bother to prosecute
anybody when he got in

590
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:27,500
go for number one fax machines forty
thousand dollars apiece

591
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,609
why cool well arm the

592
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:36,000
they don't get sand in them all you have
to do to keep senator the fax machine

593
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,540
is put it in a box to wrap it in a
plastic bag

594
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,480
and flavor forty thousand dollars that's
not how the game is supposed to be

595
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,850
played. is it it's where the money is

596
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,770
an with that in mind I mean
Halliburton's already been busted for

597
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:55,220
ripping us off for $30 million bucks and
overcharging for gasoline

598
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,080
Kellogg Brown & Root a subsidiary got
caught tripling the price have chilled

599
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,970
howls for soldiers how petty is that

600
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,980
the excuse P well the three times as
much because we thought the initials KBR

601
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,210
under the towels therefore it's okay

602
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:15,400
who knows what else is going on and we
haven't even heard about yet

603
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,850
he was in that spirit that Brammer said
to the iraqis yeah

604
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:24,049
you can get your clean water back but
it's gonna cost you $15 billion dollars

605
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,790
and take for years

606
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,770
no wonder people are a little upset over
there

607
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,230
and this is why in contrast to the
marshall plan to rebuild

608
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,100
Europe get the infrastructure going
again after world war two

609
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,609
modern money cost to that was forty 7.6
billion

610
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:48,190
go for number one cost about $60 billion

611
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,730
most of which was paid eighty percent of
which was paid by our allies

612
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:58,170
but with this looting corporate looting
and racketeering and privateering going

613
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,369
on in Iraq

614
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:04,250
boyish has already blown over a hundred
billion dollars

615
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,530
with much more to come

616
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:13,300
last fall he demanded another $87
billion dollars in congress just gave it

617
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,090
to him

618
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,070
almost no questions asked Carrie did
vote against that when I don't know how

619
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,410
Edwards voted

620
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,690
but up the $87 billion dollars

621
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,740
66 other it classified

622
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,140
wouldn't even say how it's doled out 412
million just for

623
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,109
construction of walkmans military bases

624
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:38,980
and 353 million for the private sector

625
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,140
read bribes and graft $400 million

626
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,430
for to maximum security prisons

627
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,490
how do you boil four hundred million
dollars on

628
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:55,040
to jails you can build a doled football
stadium for that amount of money

629
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,430
we really gonna do put into Olympic size
pool with gold faucets in every cell

630
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,759
free heroin for life no

631
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,109
we need that much money because quote
you have to import the cement

632
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:13,540
what do you make some and out of that
you can find

633
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,060
everywhere in Iraq the app got import
the cement

634
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,119
another hundred million dollars to build
seven gated suburbs american-style

635
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,869
probably for the American privateers

636
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:31,060
3500 housing units only in a country
we've made millions the people homeless

637
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,720
another 2.1 billion down the drain to
put the oil facilities back together

638
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,160
after Halliburton already got a no bid
contracts for $12 billion to put up the

639
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,609
ap while facilities signed almost two
weeks before we went in on the war

640
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:50,119
in secretive course but in spite of all
that for the oil infrastructure

641
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:54,900
another nine hundred million dollars to
import oil products

642
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,460
and the country sitting on the second
largest reserves in the world

643
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:03,300
and let's not forget speaking of
hacktivism or something maybe not

644
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,340
a $54 million dollar computers study

645
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,070
over iraq's Postal Service for less than
ten percent a bad

646
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:17,050
they could hire mailman to just deliver
the damn mail like they always did

647
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,240
all porno and another

648
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,740
now bush wants another 25 billion in
addition to the $87 billion

649
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,640
including a hundred million dollars to
hire private security

650
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,779
to guard the so-called green zone you
know the Green Zone is

651
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:39,410
it's a nice posh area with lots of its
buildings in downtown baghdad

652
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:45,190
we mysteriously for got to bomb then put
a berlin wall up around it so the iraqis

653
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,570
can't get into their own downtown

654
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,150
and we intend to stay there and 100
billion dollars

655
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,480
is for 14 months we're also planning to
build

656
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,980
the largest and most fortified embassy

657
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,869
ever constructed in the history of the
world we had given them back their

658
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:03,800
sovereignty

659
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,180
we plan to stay for a long long time

660
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,348
and this is what our soldiers are dying
for

661
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:16,970
in Iraq right now

662
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,950
we're getting a lap all this

663
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:26,770
be four media activists managed to get
out into the public

664
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:31,200
the pictures and the footage from abu
gray prison

665
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,840
nevermind it's been no secret in the
European media for a year earlier

666
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,340
the people are being tortured to death
in Afghanistan

667
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,480
conditions in Guantanamo Bay and things
like that

668
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,730
and these pictures never would have
gotten out except for guerilla media

669
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,170
except for Independent Media

670
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,680
and you're getting ahead of me here

671
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,910
the I intend to get all that intimately

672
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,250
man I much time left I have so much my
big mouth needs

673
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,780
they need to cover here anyway you know
those prisons and what we're doing in

674
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,820
there

675
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:12,500
that's what saddam hussein used to do
that's what's Talon in Hitler used to do

676
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,960
this is not the United from States of
America we were brought up the Preds

677
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,240
pledge allegiance to

678
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,560
is it but Lindy England

679
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,859
you know the female soldier greening in
giving the thumbs up and everything else

680
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:30,240
said quote we thought it looked funny so
we took pictures

681
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,830
we thought it looked funny so we took
pictures

682
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:40,259
what created that she may look a lot
like squeaky Fromme

683
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,670
but inside she is a helluva lot more
that like Suzanne

684
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:48,540
at Ken's the real psychopath love the
Manson Family

685
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,690
and if it was really just a few bad
apples which I doubt doing this in the

686
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,540
president's

687
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,690
who was there charles manson

688
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,720
rumsfeld his boss

689
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,030
perhaps and was especially interesting
to me

690
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,790
is a lot of the people who've gotten
caught torturing Iraqi prisoners many of

691
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,000
which we now admitted

692
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,250
were probably being held there for the
wrong reasons

693
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,640
if any reason at all

694
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,680
asylum I watched this dude any

695
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,140
okay arm you know that the lot Obama

696
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,799
were resign guards over here

697
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,960
if that's what they think is normal and
funny

698
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,390
over there what are they doing to people
that they think is acceptable

699
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:41,390
over here

700
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,400
occasionally things leak out like in
1996 when Bush was governor in texas

701
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,240
videos snuck out

702
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,560
of prisoners be forced to crawl being
beaten now the crappy down with batons

703
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,080
and being bitten by dogs have that
sounds familiar

704
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,880
corcoran prison in california guys were
caught staging

705
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,060
basically cock fights with human beings

706
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,320
mysteriously opening doors to sell the
prisoners were in rival gangs

707
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,570
allowing them to bump into each other in
the Commons try to kill each other

708
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,560
and then well we have to break up the
fight so we had to kill him

709
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,740
placing bets in everything Pelican Bay
Northern California

710
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,310
the prisoner there is a mentally ill
prisoners who finally won his lawsuit

711
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:27,009
for damages years later

712
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:30,960
after they immersed in a min boiling
water

713
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,700
you know that's what's been going on in
this country

714
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,760
and why you know the police always get
away with all the brutality

715
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,680
mike got that rogue officer you know we
did to him

716
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,299
we've reassigned him shot another black
eye in the back

717
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,160
but we've reassigned him suspended in 30
days without pay

718
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,210
a course is probably also destroyed what
little respect we have left in the

719
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,270
middle east

720
00:45:55,270 --> 00:46:01,200
Europe wherever I mean you know bush is
now the most hated president abroad in

721
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,790
history by far

722
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:06,779
when people ask what they fear for their
security they'll say terrorists they say

723
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,060
mad cow boy disease basically

724
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,299
even in Canada

725
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,910
with Bill Maher put it how bad do you
have to suck

726
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:22,020
to lose the popularity contest with the
dominoes same

727
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,190
honey the most constructive thing we
could be doing is admit to the world

728
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,380
right now okay

729
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,510
we made a mistake we're getting out get
out of Iraq

730
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,720
now people responsible with sign

731
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,270
now Ananda

732
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:45,270
not just a military occupation but and
the economic occupation as well

733
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,040
they thought we can't do that how we're
gonna lose faith

734
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,900
we've lost it already your holy could
leave it like vietnam we have no idea

735
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,320
how to get out we never planned for that

736
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,589
easy way to leave ships trucks and
airplanes

737
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:09,670
same as the way we went in yes we are
the iraqi people help

738
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:14,650
in rebuilding the country we blew up
after propping up saddam hussein in the

739
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,700
first place

740
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,290
but that does not mean said you know
sending more troops into the desert to

741
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:22,859
act as security for Halliburton and
backtalk

742
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:26,580
it means letting the united nations or
somebody else the iraqi people actually

743
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,730
respect

744
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:32,060
Ron the shell we he helped them

745
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,560
we give them the money

746
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,049
not we believe them but we

747
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:44,599
help them cause corporate Republic wraps
load hereof that

748
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:48,930
house the Majo Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi the democrat

749
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:54,609
and carry have both said what we need to
do is send 40,000 more troops to Iraq

750
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:58,210
40,000 more you need to get the troops
out

751
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,099
that doesn't make them ants

752
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:05,310
and the way to make people like that
let's turn is

753
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:09,290
in the voting booth and Ian the streets

754
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:14,060
starting now

755
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:18,490
meanwhile military recruiting the
Pentagon now admits

756
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,080
it's going down down down down down

757
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,420
almost the 25 percent drop a national
guard enlistments alone

758
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:32,830
according to ABC News 600 soldiers who
went on leave from Iraq never came back

759
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:36,009
bush's waving ten thousand dollar bonus
that indeed

760
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:39,080
bonuses that Negi is willing to realist

761
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,060
and not that many takers so what is the
solution to that

762
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,160
well that's what up on a defense
department website last fall

763
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:50,910
defend america serve your community in
the nation

764
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,770
joy in your local draft board

765
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:58,320
and now that they've got the kind of
people they want on the draft boards

766
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,670
they've up the selective service budget
the old people run the draft

767
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,869
by another $28 million dollars for
preparation

768
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:10,290
and already bush's recalled 6,000 people

769
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,880
who are already out of the military back
to duty

770
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,609
and drafted them to go back to iraq and
Rumsfeld even talked about well we have

771
00:49:18,609 --> 00:49:21,580
a draft it'll be a special skills draft

772
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,240
we may only want people to feel specific
goals in the military

773
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,810
people who know Middle Eastern languages
and

774
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,890
people who are good with computers

775
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:38,750
so hello and don't think you can get to
Canada as easily this time because tom

776
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,240
ridge made a deal

777
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,010
with krajinan up there before crashing
left office

778
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,520
to tighten their asylum laws for draft
dodgers

779
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,310
can't get any more after all it might
cause terrorism

780
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,500
and prevent them from drafting you to
help

781
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,630
diaper Wolfman and bush and Dick
Cheney's

782
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,820
friends in world war two was different

783
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,830
the profiteers were robbed

784
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:08,930
arm I know I know will get that

785
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:13,319
the proper people try to profit off to
where r were considered traitors

786
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,220
they are brought to justice and wanna
lead prosecutors before I moved up

787
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,800
was harry truman now the opposite

788
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,330
as far as i'm concerned. if bill clinton
could get impeached

789
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:28,590
for unauthorized weenie my singing

790
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:34,960
and the governor of California re called
for raising the tax on cars

791
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,890
shouldn't george bush did Chi and every
member of congress who keeps getting in

792
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,180
the money for the way or

793
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,379
be impeached for treason

794
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:51,380
the

795
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:59,660
me how what can we do to save ourselves
mean tried any further down the road to

796
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,370
ruin

797
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,500
and off a cliff and down the toilet by a
bush a dick

798
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,690
and a colon

799
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:10,940
don't believe the hype we're patriotic
citizens still

800
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,100
because we're the ones who give a damn
about this country

801
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,810
and give a damn about the world around
us know willing to get off our butts to

802
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:24,320
make it better

803
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,450
her insurrection in the street

804
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:32,630
but that doesn't get that much done
without insurrection in the voting booth

805
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:37,570
ted Lieu how many people registered to
vote

806
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:41,730
that's why higher than most people I
talk to her but it's far from a hundred

807
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:42,790
percent

808
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:47,480
and far from how many people would show
up if we all went out and got more about

809
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,710
your friends to register and show up

810
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:53,470
and vote smart not just nationally

811
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:56,950
10 most importantly the ball is local
elections

812
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,210
it matters who's mayor who's on the City
Council

813
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:07,210
who's the state legislature who's on the
school board

814
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:12,720
and we had a brain allege in this
country that they don't have in Canada

815
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,840
they don't have any European country I
know I love and that's called the ballot

816
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,860
initiative the proposition 3 get to vote
yea or nay on changing the law

817
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,600
when politicians you too corrupt or
chicken shit to do it themselves

818
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,160
and when we show up that's how we get
things like medical marijuana

819
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,710
rent control living wage laws

820
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:38,880
Econo Lodge recall land use laws and all

821
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,880
and if we don't show up you can bet the
christian coalition the hammerheads will

822
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,690
so many people showed up not only does
so few people show up in local elections

823
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:58,810
that arm the deal will emit more people
like %uh show up we have that much

824
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,040
better chance at getting

825
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,310
good people elected and good laws passed

826
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:07,549
and I'm hoping this whole ground swell
love arm

827
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:11,300
up the insurrection against bush against
the war

828
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,440
will blossom into a much bigger version
up the

829
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,150
anti-corporate rule anti-globalization

830
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:25,150
spirit of Seattle in thorough action
tale

831
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,720
nor am almost done and the
billion-dollar matter what they try to

832
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,820
impose the last through or natural
whatever else

833
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:37,120
have said this every time that's the
beauty of the digital age

834
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,009
no matter what they do to try and cage

835
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,750
us some bored teenager out there
somewhere

836
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,850
is gonna find a way to get around in rec

837
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:55,009
the Horde playing the

838
00:53:55,010 --> 00:54:00,140
holy hell happened to them if john
ashcroft is still the attorney general

839
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:03,190
what will happen to them if carey is
present for that matter

840
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:06,540
I can understand the anybody but bush
Sanomat

841
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:10,180
but the last time people voted that way
we got clinton

842
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,360
and then look what we got nafta wtoo

843
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,560
the telecommunications act that gave
away the airwaves the corporation's

844
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,920
if carrie gets then this time we can
just go to sleep for eight years

845
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,060
we gotta get the biggest blow torch we
confide and keep it up is the Athol

846
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:32,290
tiny where

847
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,210
russell et

848
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:40,460
I vote my conscience and I if I love all
for care a

849
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:44,730
he's gotta convince me by telling me
what he's gonna do about the drug war

850
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:48,130
whether he's going to abolish the
Patriot Act all averred

851
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:52,900
what he's gonna do to fix our welfare
laws so poor people have a chance

852
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:57,010
and for that matter only caveat that
blowtorch what are we in this room gonna

853
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,350
do i mean Steve Wozniak was here earlier

854
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,500
and there's always people this
convention who

855
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,810
you know ard half is down on the big

856
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:10,610
plundering CEO's as they wish they were
10

857
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:15,470
dumb you know that's why so many people
got condom the dot-com boom in San

858
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:16,260
Francisco

859
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,050
by bigger greed heads they just bought
into it all

860
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:25,940
don't let it happen to you help people
build sharper bullshit detectors

861
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,250
by spreading information and education
knowledge

862
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,690
years power after all on the power to
influence

863
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,640
and break down the limits on freedom and
make them harder to impose

864
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,180
you know helped make history instead of
just watching it on TV are gossiping

865
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,260
around the neck

866
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:46,010
but on the net resistance after all
don't let anybody from afar to: laughter

867
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:46,710
that

868
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:50,630
wilbur PC people tell you the resistance
shouldn't be fun

869
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:55,360
granted it's not all Disney find it's
not some mergers groom struggle against

870
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,200
fascism

871

everything

873
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:05,660
I don't have time to the proper the
planks I was gonna get to

874
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:11,850
but basically this time as much as file
sharing and software important

875
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:15,130
right now we're fighting for our
survival

876
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:20,050
not just the survival of our culture's
but the survival of freedom as we know

877
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,950
it on this planet

878
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:25,760
we can avail getting in the rain with
these people anymore

corporations that fails to mentor

888
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,350
executive conventions

889
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:20,049
where they'd hire a vaudeville troupe to
compose and perform a musical about how

890
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:21,800
