1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,930
okay

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,860
well we did it it's %ah the

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:21,860
on

4
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,410
I have to pay the same to such a rush I
yet you never know

5
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,950
how you gonna get through it all but
somehow we make every time I have to say

6
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:37,950
I don't think I'm exaggerating I think
this one was the best one yet the

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,589
and the reason for that is because we
learn something every time we we get

8
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,190
more more organized this time

9
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,290
I just think it looks so much better
than before are no small part

10
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,990
thanks to Jen and her artwork all over
the place and and just the many

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,590

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,600

31
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,370
choice

34

everybody a volunteer to help out here

35
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,440
twenty people security forty people
inaki say

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,079
we had let's say how many people in AB

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,049
2035 something like that hell I

38
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,700

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,420
without me %ah

42
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,640
if this were some kind of a commercial
copper as you know we could've we can

43
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,000
afford to pay everybody do this and now
you have to pay like two hundred fifty

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,090
dollars to attend

45
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,180
so we try to keep this affordable to
everybody in

46
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,090
like within reason and still not lose
our shirt on and we managed a little bit

47
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,150
each year but I we want to give your the
time to everybody

48
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,980
and without all these volunteers are
just simply would be impossible there is

49
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,000
nothing it's the best at the on town for
50 bucks for a weekend

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the

51
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,519
I also in in addition to the official
volunteers are so many view held at

52
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:43,890
other ways just a

53
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,989
by by lending a hand whenever we needed
something and just buy a by treating the

54
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,120
hotel with respect in each other with
respect like anything

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,670
that made all the difference in the
world that's why we'll be able to come

56
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,660
back here because you to carry the place
and

57
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,060
the they've they're telling us before
how great they were

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,330
how happy they were with the people that
were here how responsible everybody was

59
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,769
and I it's going to be great because in
a few weeks ago have always republicans

60
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,459
running around and that's where

61
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,660
even say we did a better job than they
did the

62
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,649
on

63
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,120
I wanna give a special thanks to road in
the security code because without them

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,630
all kinds of things would have been in
an uproar in it as think they handle it

65
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,020
extremely professionally

66
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,169
and they were friendly everybody it was
just a great

67
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,690
a great team to have on our side
basically of how would a broken loose

68
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,690
without them how many people had a good
time

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,240
the

70
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,619
on

71
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,800
nah nah nah nah nah how many people had
a good

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,510
time the

73
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,750
the now that's more like it

74
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,660
we had a few problems somebody who

75
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,250
remains on mentioned or a buncha
somebody's

76
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,850
Yelp few you know

77
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,920
did decide to kill a crazy way to China
marker in some the elevators in

78
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,970
then this full decided that pentium
stickers needed to be all over the

79
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,220
band this it by the way this is not
hacking

80
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,890
okay just so in case anybody has any
questions

81
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,880
this is stupidity in action any way
other than that

82
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,230
nothin really got stolen here I would
really

83
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,230
applaud everybody for basically keeping
this one under control damage amounts

84
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,030
were probably way under the last couple
of Khan's then again we did broker a

85
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,600
deal with some other people who ran off
with the letters last year and really

86
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,690
embarrassed me but we won't talk about
that were handmade by Rodi we might add

87
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,150
last time and this time

88
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,530
yeah by the way we may give away those
letters you know anybody who needs a

89
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:00,260
245 put your forty five-pound four-foot
letters saying I don't live

90
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,740

advantage to remove your room without a

212
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,660
good idea I'm

213
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:47,660
yeah the partly my present charter
Baraboo kept it running round the clock

route $24.3 redneck comedy films we have
altogether roughly

216
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,420
you say I I would estimate we probably
had

217
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,020
over 25 films I mean we had a ton of
material I really like to thank um

218
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,120
Evan and Eric and jailed for helping
with it they

219
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,600
you know I'm were able to get ships
going in so that we

220
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,550
would now be exhausted by the end the
weekend so they were entering the well

221
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,640
part of getting and

222
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,240
they also manage feeds from %uh from
upstairs here for a for

223
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,020
a summer the keynote speeches for out
now Steve Wozniak in for the social

224
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,920
engineering panel with this room is so
full

225
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,170
we couldn't fit everybody would put in
we had overflow crowds in the movie room

226
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,380
to watching the feed

227
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:33,380
and a that was amazing %uh that was
pulled off %ah

228
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,970
and I know they're just appear before I
think we really should

229
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,140
pay special attention to the people kept
the network running through adverse I

230
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,080
circumstances

231
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,280
drive-by %ah

232
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,540
cancer couple runs on now with the
challenges were and how we

233
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,839
overcame them think we just went over
this site

234
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,620
20 minutes ago but I I really think I am
to me

235
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,080
I important notes is at I am your
planning is important so I

236
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,520
we didn't plan B would had the spirit
Peter asked past mistakes

237
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,939
I am know we mi plan ahead I look at the
problems make sure that we solve them

238
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:22,670
it introduce new problems so we have
some challenges for next time they'll

239
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,680
make sure we fix

240
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,240
but I think with if hopefully we have
the same team that we had this year

241
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,870
make sure the matter so guys wanna thank

242
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,310

out very

248
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,780
a sort of a scary lofts I have that was
that was constructed

249
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,069
about miles bad hand I and in that that
was a little scary

250

to the conference

252
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,200
on also maybe I did a real good prove
the concept of

253
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,370
why we do the networks we do you know
why the 218 link was important because

254
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,440
if an opportunity 18 Fiberlink we would
not have had the old movies going to the

255
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,350
overflow room

256
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,660
I one had wireless up here I it's made
things more complicated so they have a

257
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,980
little extra effort in a

258
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,340
you know I running 513 between the two
floors very important

259
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,790
unfortunately Adam isn't here but Adam

265
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,240
giving us the IT once again

266
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,360

267
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,770
%ah

268
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,680

288
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,189
in most like 99 percent of the people
who are using the network and

289
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,250
I'm not too happy with that one percent
that abuses the network but you know hey

290
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,090
that's with us now

291
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,360
america is all about is always gonna be
abused from square that you know we did

292
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,540
have a network that was

293
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,940
I think the networks it up to the abuse
personally so and I'm

294
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,210
you know am thankful for the work that
the steamed at South give the team

I've already said a whole lot about the
NOC staff guys wanna say one more thing

298
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,550
arm adam has done so much work for the
not getting everything up and running

299
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,830

everybody has net access here

300
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,340
so I I just wanna say we get another an
imposter Adam

301
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:04,340
stance the on

302
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,750
another thing we had this year that I
think was

303
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,640
much better than years past was our
selection %uh vendors I in the back over

304
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,550

on that point on that point I'd like to
thank all the vendors for giving us some

309
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,840
stuff to give to you guys in a couple
minutes

310
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,840
they've been pretty generous this year
and circa by the people been running

311
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,210
tirelessly around our organizing
speakers making sure everybody gets to

312
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,370
the body mount I make sure they get off
on time

313
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,590
I have Chris Gragg Nubian laszlo lycra
much

314
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:57,590
%ah

315
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,949
on it's been a lot of fun

316
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,420
thanks to the speaker's

317
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,690
especially everyone's on time prepared
brought their stuff Banda

318
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,590
responded well when it was time to go
except for want one panel

319
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,080
jus when our little over time

320
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,460
but everything else was great and I
don't blame anyone ever be on my upper

321
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,460
half an hour

322
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,550
I think this compass is a great vibe

323
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,740
I'm a lot of us were running circles
around and going crazy and sometimes

324
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,870
it's kinda hard to tell but people would
stop us on the elevators and say you

325
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,370
know I

326
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,770
this is I think the best conference now
that I've

327
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,510
that up until the best hacker conference
and that vibe is due to everybody in

328
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,360
this room

329
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,390
audit you at the stories I've heard
about people travel into this thing and

330
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,670
unbelievable it's like a Grateful Dead
show for geeks but

331
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,450
and and you know complete with people
sleeping under tables in the back

332
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,500
I'm but that vibe is because this is a
community

333
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,580
and the way this community grows is by

334
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,419
telling your friends sharing 2600 with
people

335
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,350
who might not know what hacking is I
might be afraid that word

336
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,330
on share the knowledge bring more people
into this community

337
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,470
so that we can stay strong in defeat
sinus like some the laws that are coming

338
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,140
down the pipe thanks for coming everyone

339
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:35,140
the

340
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,840
com something other thing is to be noted
that the speakers themselves we had

341
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,330
something like seventy different

342
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,629
panels and I think 100 speakers

343
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,840
and I think they are they all were here
and they all showed up and I'll give

344
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,080
really well-received talks and that's a
that's no small thing that means a lot

345
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,730
that they

346
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,980
came from all over the world to present
to you guys

347
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,180
and that you guys listen to what they
had to say thanks to them

348
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:09,180
her

349
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,889
I'm sure other people were forgetting
and things were forgetting but one thing

350
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,130
I don't want to forget is

351
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,360

374
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,830
an amazing feat if we can pull it off as
a as adam said if you are on

375
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,879
if you can tell the difference between

00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,429
encourage you

409
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:44,510
is was shut off the network gone almost
immediately after the conference

410
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,850
I so so don't be surprised are by that

411
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,200
and II cured if you're sitting in the
audience with your laptop these last few

412
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,960
bites

413
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,440
that you're going to get are for people
that might want to help with audio

414
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,590
visual we do have a i demonstration a
range which you can take its this is

415
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,850
I skills hacker skills she should be
taking home with you

416
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:10,080
on I'm oiling gear we have a web page

417
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,740
ok

418
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,100
was quick to it it AV is not just the
geeky kid in the back at the grade

419
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,100
school classroom running the slide
projectors actually a lot

420
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,200
set lot so at what goes into it and lots
a little subtleties that creep up when

421
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,620
you're

422
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,880
when you're angling all this gear so I'm

423
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,020
want one of the things that that people
learn when we're when they're working

424
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,740
with this stuff

425
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,760
is the proper technique for rolling
cables so if you see somebody

426
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,879
doing this arm thing stop them that's
the wrong way to do it

427
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,950
pic because one one thing you wind up
with a net twist down the cable and gets

428
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,840
all messed up next time it right on
rolling

429
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,260
so I'm there's a a

430
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,780
page at Techno phantom .org slashed with
a hobbit

431
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,910
as a whole bunch of like random maybe
lighting at Sentara

432
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,980
info under there and pointers to other
places that has been collecting over

433
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,510
time

434
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,710
cell apart right way to roll a cable
missus nice

435
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,810
some some big step a stage pin

436
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:15,840
lighting cable the carries 20 amps just
roll it up like

437
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,300
you'd normally coil 11 lou p.m. the next
loop you wanna do this kinda subtle move

438
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,920
work oils under itself and

439
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,440
alternate all the way down so most you
are 11

440
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,270
get this might wanna do it but I'm just
try to avoid the arm thing and try and

441
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,340
do this under over flip and that way

442
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,580
the shop when they get all these cables
back will really thank you for that

443
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:44,580
because that's the way they're all them
thanks and you just learn something

444
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,290
valuable he runs your own purposes to

445
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,520
speaker valuable lessons arm

446
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:57,220
I didn't mention this but to if you
happened to have just

447
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,540
accidentally acquired something here
that you don't they

448
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,840
gay should have taken radios

449
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,679
is posters whatever you wanna get rid of
them without having any other problems

450
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:10,409
on your conscience the

451
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:14,480
security team would love to see those
downstairs second floor

452
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,080
we well ha telephone

453

work

490
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,590
this me nice and organized how many have
you been wondering about these things

491
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,519
the hotel is one thing about these
things a little comment about how about

492
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,630
cyber cyber terrorism

493
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,919
yes I don't need is some concern I
suspect the

494
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,659
15 what is as well take they came up to
me and said this this is something we

495
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:07,580
have to be concerned about is open

496
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,760
for now you know me about it the other
thing of course was one of Jen's posters

497
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,309
downstairs I had the upside-down flag
apparently pedestrians walking by and

498
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,658
they noticed this mister complaining and
and the

499
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:21,700
yeah well they they the

500
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,679
made us take it down but they didn't
agree that themselves but you know you

501
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:26,460
don't wanna happy that she's complaining
too much

502
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,669
but the thing is I kept complaining even
after it was taken down so it's really

503
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:30,610
kinda bizarre

504
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,049
but to yet that tells about the
prescriber

505
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:38,070
are these are water technically known as
a form 5081

506
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,340
people use back in the air late 60's
early 70's

507
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,750
are you receive a year those of us who
are old enough to remember receiving a

508
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,220
I like electric utility bills gas water
bills in these things in an envelope

509
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,750
marked

510
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,580
do not fold spindle army delayed you're
welcome to sports been limited lately is

511
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,879
to your heart's content by the way and
adderall /url

512
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,510
you know accurately encoded all the
characters along the top

513
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,490
the top %uh your cards RR correspond to

514
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,149
the column punches if you look they're
actually included in ASCII

515
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:16,159
and at the last four digits are unique
and they are asking and I had

516
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,159
tonight at CITIC they are asking
included

517
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:22,500
say anyone have a card reader handy so
yeah at this hour

518
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,669
I would've wanted to bring the card
reader here don't like to some

519
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:28,399
demonstration sorting them and so forth
but a

520
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,659
it weighs a more than all of us up here
combined

521
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:34,980
several and we really wanted to make
them bright

522
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,769
red I'm biting in corresponding with the

523
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:43,320
the Artistic Team at the conference but
opera some reason the US Navy

524
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,439
had already huge quantity upgrade IBM
punch bags Burberry

525
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,419
I recently and we are my book organizer

526
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:56,330
group were wondering what was a US Navy
during ordering

527
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,350
huge quantities red IBM plans credit
service or ominous

528
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,960
butter we had to settle for yellow which
corresponds well with our current state

529
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,289
of

530
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:09,120
Homeland Security Alert cell but we had
a scan the first day was there to

531
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,940
Thursday

532
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,010
I'll be there is a asshole asking her
Kari Lehtonen was there is talk going to

533
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,799
Aurangabad

534
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,129
the morning and quiet now it really does
our their

535
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:22,080
hunkered in prime but each card has its
own unique serial number last four

536
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,700
digits everyone has their own

537
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,740
Nick cyber terrorist a suspect number

538
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,750
and everybody will be the best and
fairest way to

539
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,399
the word are some other I'm honest or
prizes we have here tonight cell

540
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,130
but management terrible mismatch here I
give thanks to another our organization

541
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,120
that has helped bring us to this level
paranoid the prime time massacre

542
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,000
thank you so much for making this
possible %ah

543
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,139
has hearing paranoia generator the best
art around and I hope they have

544
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:56,590
now to see many more such our examples
of that these things make very good but

545
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,559
marked by the way

546
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,230
on this couple other pieces the trivia
about these cards are

547
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,510
again their prom 5081 are typically used
in early mid 70's

548
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,969
I am they were encoded with a at

549
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,040
type IBM 029 data recorder

550
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,580
which allows a I somebody remembers that
how

551
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,719
on like which I have to keep my pitching
allowed interspersed game punching

552
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,220
I don't usually gangster punching that
day but are where the master original

553
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,159
car guy with the other upper left hand
corner cut were upper right hand corner

554
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:30,750
cut

555
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:35,889
which was selected by switch on your 29
are enter fired with blank copy cards

556
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,520
and information from the master card is
a automatically reproduced

557
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,819
punched and printed are however many
copy cards follow the

558
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:46,980
for the Impala the MasterCard butter I
give you more more

559
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,589
on trivia about this but it's really
really boring to most people but anyhow

560
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:51,480
it's great he said

561
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,589
technological a souvenir to take back in
and uses a

562
00:34:55,589 --> 00:35:00,009
bookmark or whatever as have a quick
comment did anyone notice any hanging

563
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,589
chads on these cards

564
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:06,349
we take great pains to avoid any
controversy and we removed every

565
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:10,630
Chad there was hanging there are a lotta
States

566
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,990
and missus power do you still use these
as Sir

567
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:18,210
our a similar lunch prizes for voting in
a frankly we think that's more reliable

568
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:18,960
than somebody's

569
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,150
electronic voting schemes because you
have a paper trail you can discern the

570
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,330
intent of the voter

571
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,630
more accurately than this looking at
some filing you know what they intended

572
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,040
so

573
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,069
anyway well with oprah Radio we wanna
come up with some scheme to awarding

574
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:33,550
some

575
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,069
somebody's door prizes here based on the
last four digits of their punch cards

576
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:42,080
so we're on anyway got no you will save
your cards didn't you because you needed

577
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,270
the years yes

578
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,400
all right now good is this is really
just a heads up in the air

579
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:54,400
but hey that's a great picture alright
get a paradise

580
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:59,520
by unless they're like 10 digit days a
week and a harder

581
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,830
decimal decimal number days

582
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:07,230
she has 10 sided dice he does have a
suggestion

583
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,080
the

584
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,160
on glad she's prepared

585
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,770
each other we have this by any chance

586
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:23,280
always go by creating a good enough but
twenty sided dice

587
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,070
is that of week in week with

588
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:31,070
we can use look at that doesn't matter
we can so use their okay

589
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:36,830
we can use you can use I ran inside a
guys

590
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:43,830
what why do people carry these this is
very accommodating

591
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,650
not okay we're bickering over how to do
this will be

592
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:03,650

what's what's on tap here was gonna take
a long time

596
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,240
so we're gonna go with the proper one
first and then the last one so

597
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,369
was content in 10 till anybody

599
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:32,300
all right way wrong without me so in an
orderly fashion in the last three days

600
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,109
should be any in 102 is that you got

601

the last three digits 1.0 yes we've got

602
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:43,190
itemizing aware no

603
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,650

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,520
one 102 mm lasted yeah but then perhaps

605
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,410
yeah we know there are no way yeah we
know along with me now we know that

606
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,569
