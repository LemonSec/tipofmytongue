1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,000
I can about automotive computer networks

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,589
and are so in Area C we had a previous
very present surgeon

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,090
with hacking and technologies that
what's up by insects that out after this

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,250
a popular for a while

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,530
so right now nothing face are networks
thank you

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,410
guys are you okay

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,189
so I'm not think this I know this is the
I move networks

8
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:33,050
people overview via presentation say few
words by myself

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,218
give you an idea my perspective on a on
the topics are presenting here

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,250
talk lil bit about you know why buying
unions with

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,940
care body is tough enough for me with
you know what might be applicable to

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,140
things to do your background on

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,230
electronics and automobiles over the
history on

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,840
where it is now in were maybe going
future talk quite a bit about

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,789
obd2 the on-board diagnostics to
standard I'm it's a

16
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,829
pretty much a a good state where the

17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,900
automotive electronic network buses are
present-day

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,299
you talk about the common usage of that
physical and a link

19
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,080
diagnostic mode since and existing
products try to talk about that with

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,880
respect to the

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,110
Orsay my love networking just freeman in
a in a more

22
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,330
computer science taper have a model that
is

23
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,590
more translatable to things you might be
more familiar with I mean again present

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,390
open auto at the end up some software
hardware been working on 2 I'm

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,970
these protocols so

26
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,110
about myself education like gorky
engineering I have experience in the

27
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,320
hardware and software design

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,899
so I'm pretty you know academic
impression the experience in that but

29
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:45,159
I'll

30
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,280
as far as i'm ok Go's observe a Saturday
afternoon mechanic

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,399
I'm not afraid reason arrange for a
mechanical engineer animals are

32
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,439
concerned about privacy

33
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,820
I'm so why

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,579
why would anyone the Ives care about the
network buses on automobile

35
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,189
well for one there's there's a bit of a
monopoly

36
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,640
as far as the means automobiles goes you
can

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,889
very easily by service manual tells you
all the details about

38
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,090
every mechanical part in vehicle every
ball every night size and specs hurt or

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,550
kill

40
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:20,239
with a great deal accuracy but this very
limited information about electronics

41
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,940
for schematics goes very high level is
very little

42
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,489
protocol information and his nurse those
no source code for the

43
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:31,129
down controllers and one on sign on
mobile so

44
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,950
as more more functionality goes inside a
black boxes joining us and serve my

45
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,319
controller microprocessor as running
source code there's more more

46
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,470
outside the ground love you know and
every day you know

47
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,349
automobile owners to get access to ensue
you know tinker with their own vehicle

48
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:46,760
and

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,950
modified and maintained as they see fit
is also as privacy implications

50
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,560
you know because there's as urs this
black box anymore more functionality

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:55,910
thats

52
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,079
not observable by the user they could
very well be doing things that

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,470
vehicle or may not agree with you know
could be recording could be transmitting

54
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,810
information without you knowing

55
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,180
I was no way to there's no way to figure
that out because this is black boxes

56
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,340
that's not available to you

57
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,800
and and it also makes it the vehicle
more to the control manufacture they can

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,379
said in certain primer certain limits
were the vehicles controlled in a way

59
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:18,709
that

60
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,200
you don't have model you have knowledge
of how to control but you don't have the

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,299
ability to change it to remove the
controls a change to control something

62
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:26,220
you see fit so

63
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,060
are giving them manufactures more
additional restrictions that

64
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,599
you know weren't were previously
possible with mechanical systems

65

Council background automotive
electronics and automobiles

66
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,830
under the hood present state generally
those a number of different electronic

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,200
was with girly things to be controlled
by microcontrollers

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,390
on notice things like new york brake
controller structural air bags of fairly

00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,189
complex systems lot sensors

73
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:00,489
but I'll upwards to control and does
control

74
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:03,810
you know more more by software systems
running

75
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,610
Merkel electronic control units
basically microcontrollers inside the

76
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,060
vehicle

77
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,110
is also use a reasonable our systems
again more more this is becoming

78
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,709
controlled by my électronique such as
the climate control systems

entertainment navigations Communications
Inc cell phone

80
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:25,540
are the types of Bluetooth communication
early on

81
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,910
the standard the for standard for the M
for communicating with vehicles

82
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,190
I was the on-board diagnostics one
standard I'm is required by the

83
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,620
the federal EPA in the United States
onto

84
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,330
maintain certain emission standards that
were mandated by law

85
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,300
the standard the the federal law didn't
require particular standard

86
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,270
implementation

87
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,609
which allowed its manufacture to go
their own route which the

88
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,910
ended up doing and there's a plethora of
different

89
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,889
def implementations that if you want to
work with any particular vehicle you

90
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,780
after sir start from scratch to
understand protocol work that's all

91
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,729
they're all very individual

92
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,430
the on-board diagnostics to which is to
the current a mandate for vehicles made

93
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,330
after nineteen ninety-six

94
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,099
again is the federalize United States

95
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,039
is targeting is targeting emissions
control systems there's similar laws

96
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,289
like in Europe isn't your be the
standard

97
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:23,570
I'm in Japan in East Asia there's other
similar standards that require similar

98
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,900
things

99
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,840
the United States standard user requires
is written by the

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,110
SEC Sidebottom engineers in that

101
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm specifies how these what is network
thing to do the standards any to

102
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,600
here too as far as interfacing and
protocols were not so that

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,639
its it easy to make air about
interoperable equipment

104
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,780
on so Scopus obd2 on

105
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,919
it covers a physical connector there's a
1610

106
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,180
connector in vehicle has to be a certain
place with drivers the

107
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,750
Thursday link layer others three options
all get to those in a little bit

108
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,550
and as a network protocol ones their
standardized so that

109
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,800
want these three today link layers
insane our protocol has been playing all

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,360
vehicles

111
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,090
so this is trying to encourage the
ability to

112
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,090
manufacture interoperable equipment new
diagnostic

113
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,419
diagnostic procedures the only
diagnostics that are required by federal

114
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,219
law are the emissions control systems

115
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,430
which is things like oxygen sensors fuel
mixture ratios

116
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,050
rpm it's another very basic operating

117
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,009
opening sensors that the vehicle and and
that's it so there's a lot of

118
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,500
electronics vehicle it's not covered by
the

119
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,490
the federal law for the the EPA federal
law so

120
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,039
the diagnostic system setup so many
factors use that for

121
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,380
dying is 90 see other systems they have
in the vehicle but is not a requirement

122
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,000
for thats is not as much a
standardization that

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,060
and again so going back to see standard

124
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,240
it it also specifies packet formats and
it types this diagnostic data

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,569
on that is required and also specifies a
few other features that are not

126
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:08,690
required by federal law but our are the
standard I'm in so many factors use them

127
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,190
serve their own discretion for however
it's useful to their systems on

128
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,789
to read and write issue memory p.m.
microcontrollers in various

129
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:19,419
units have programmable memory flash
memory basically

130
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:22,889
and you can basically a firmware
upgrades for your thereby controller

131
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:23,819
analog breaks

132
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,210
them one on your vehicle you can also
change on

133
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,419
to change calibration parameters and
modify the

134
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:35,750
property characters vehicle that way as
well is also a security feature

135
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,449
that is not a very cryptographically
secure security feature but

136
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,599
-ism a small barrier that is

137
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,759
at the manufacturer's discretion to use
for preventing access to certain

138
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,599
features

139
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:53,020
for example manufacture me feel that
programming me like brake controller

140
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,169
is a safety idea safety item that they
don't they don't want to be concerned

141
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:57,979
liability so

142
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,199
they they put the security feature on
such that its

143
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,470
another level oven difficulties to
reprogram that so you accidentally

144
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,490
do something unsafe and open up to
liability

145
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,110
on some one common usage up the obd2

146
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,449
buses is prized by far the most common
is the so-called scandal on that's

147
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:21,270
a name that's on par the obd2 Speccy
uses to refer to this

148
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,479
this unit that close to the vehicle from
outside the vehicle

149
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,068
and I'm its use to communicate with the
on-board

150
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:33,419
systems for diagnostics basically the
way I diagnostic

151
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,149
procedure works one other on board on
vehicle systems

152
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,149
with detective all Commission perhaps
too much on

153
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,390
you know extra to rich in the exhaust or
I'm similar type

154
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,439
failure of a sensor something like that

155
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,019
it would store a diagnostic trouble code
DTC

156
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,140
thats basically a number that represents
the the table there that occurred as

157
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,380
more detail about it if it's

158
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,540
particular oxygen sensor what failures
occurred at it the two mean to rate sure

159
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,649
the sensor give some value out of bounds
it says it's feeling

160
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:08,899
that made depending on the severity of
the air

161
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,600
may cause the check engine light to
eliminate which limits the dashboard

162
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
advises the driver that

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,860
the vehicle has a as a problem and needs
to be serviced

164
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,880
arm so mechanical would plug in the
scandal to be able to scan disk

165
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,260
called standings code out read it out on
display on unit

166
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,990
have the unit also describe what that
could mean so four-digit number and tell

167
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,630
you that

168
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,760
this means oxygen sensor bank a sensor
to

169
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,209
tackling condition then they can use
that as a

170
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,339
service start point for their diagnostic
trouble shooting to

171
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,830
fix the vehicle so that once the
mechanic fixes the vehicle

172
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,850
you can clear the code base erase it the
check engine light shuts off and

173
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,260
cars back to back to normal on so that's

174
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,580
this or the diagnostic use the skin tone
that's really only

175
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,529
as far as diagnostics love the

176
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,570
in emissions related vehicle subsystems
thats all that is required by

177
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,899
the federal law and that's all that is
required standardizes a lot more

178
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:10,500
available on the vehicle but this not
standardized so there's

179
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,690
more little more difficulty and serve
understanding how that works in Figure

180
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,089
and interoperable another common usage
that

181
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:21,230
is not standardized as I get required by
law but

182
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,600
done there there's some talk to this may
be required

183
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,190
pile on the future is a crash data
recorder which is linked to the air bags

184
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,200
which are required

185
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,380
United States by federal law to be in
vehicles

186
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:38,720
the what a crash data recorder does is
its part the airbag control module

187
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,410
the airbag control module senses were
considered called deployment and non

188
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,709
deployment events

189
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,110
a deployment event his own conditions
the

190
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,250
cause it to trigger the air bags inflate
you

191
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,459
detecting an accident when I based on
sensor inputs

192
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,860
putting solar honors and wheel speed
sensors and one

193
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,570
on born on deployment event which is
something close to an accident

194
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,110
but not quite enough know all the
conditions are right for the airbag to

195
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,200
inflate

196
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,500
but it's a severe condition whatever
regard unless

197
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,970
so this control module stores this this
event and deployment or 9.7

198
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,350
and when it stores the event you can
store more than just the sensor input

199
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,190
signals in store

200
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,470
vehicle speed engine speed proposition
breaks the

201
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,690
driver seat belt position whether it's
been you know engaged or not

202
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,399
are makers this we anything any sensors
available vehicle like potentially be

203
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,620
storing that

204
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,690
I'm and then that's available for
retrieval

205
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,480
by buying by mechanic or century law
enforcement after an accident for

206
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,050
forensic analysis so

207
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,560
you know whose fault the accident was or
what not

208
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,089
so this this may have some privacy
implications because

209
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,570
you know people may not know that their
vehicle has Information Store they may

210
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,600
not want their vehicle to mark on them

211
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,380
but they may not be under the control
because after an accident they may be a

212
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,870
you know confused disoriented and not
realize that law enforcement Allen

213
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,110
information or

214
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,300
perhaps in the vehicle goes after the
service the mechanic may not have the

215
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,040
best intentions in mind or may not care
about individuals

216
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,240
privacy images to you know allow the

217
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,800
law enforcement have the information or
do whatever they want with them

218
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,800
mechanics me people's themselves for his
lawyers in

219
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,380
on and then so and I mean

220
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,620
just whatever is a the you know anything
to be down there and

221
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,589
there's that not a lot of controllers
information

222
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,910
them once a vehicle repair the modules
other reset

223
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,040
replaced in bisbee sir set back to
normal

224
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,889
good to go again the air bags themselves
at your place so a familiar

225
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,339
airbag modules DIMMs control models are
also

226
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:50,339
replaced and this is a hand for a
question um

227
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,790
make sure we can take some questions the
answer maybe you can get some discussion

228
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,248
about that

229
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:58,559
it on so

230
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,399
getting back to the so the network stack
that the on-board diagnostics

231
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,910
to justifies at the physical layer there
are three buses that are on

232
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,230
specified by the on board a nice to spec

233
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:14,309
basically one of these three is required
to be in by federal law

234
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:17,529
there PWM pulse width modulation so

235
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:23,350
41.6 kilobits BPW verbal pulse width
modulation template for kilobits in the

236
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,829
so-called ISO which is basically
standardized by

237
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:31,029
ISO but as the references are in
consideration for European car

238
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:32,540
manufacturers that tend to use

239
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,589
I so specifications over

240
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,050
SE I'm for similar type I'll
functionality

241
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,619
I mean that's a in a synchronous
protocol is very similar to

242
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:46,379
sale por una PC answering a template for
kilobits

243
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,160
in fact that it's similar to this report
PCs actually taking a job by some

244
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,629
earlier

245
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,999
low-cost service to community vehicle
again some other many fact major

246
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:57,759
manufacturers Kempton 2m

247
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,480
gravitate toward one of these buses but
these are not down

248
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,240
you know across the board rules because
often vehicles

249
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,689
smaller vehicle manufacturers that are
part of a larger ones 10+2

250
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:12,299
utilize a bus that's more based on their
history then based on

251
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,449
the current owner there the company I'm
in and some other physical layers that

252
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:17,799
are

253
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,709
some insignificant for a on board
vehicles are the can Controller Area

254
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:22,290
Network

255
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,360
which is a higher speed bus and that's
often used for real-time communication

256
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:26,929
between

257
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:31,240
controllers on a vehicle where one unit
maybe something will speed and maybe

258
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,600
transmit that information over the CAN
bus to

259
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,199
the some other unit that would take
action on that perhaps the sensor sends

260
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,319
it to the air bear

261
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:41,449
nearby controller or the you know the
tracks control system

262
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:45,490
in real time for the operation vehicle
uses the bus to

263
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,959
to communicate between controllers and
the usage of that is

264
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,149
is more in the higher-end vehicles have
on more complicated control system a

265
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,980
comp electronic control systems but

266
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,459
its increasing usage and is also being
see more and

267
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:02,569
the lower sir Bradley downline the

268
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,079
surprise points vehicles many other
buses that are

269
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,230
significant there's there's a number the
like mentioned obd1 didn't have a

270
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,980
standardized

271
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,490
sterilizer implementation so there's a
number of different proprietor ones that

272
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,299
manufactures had and before that

273
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,470
some higher-end models remember
manufactures had buses on it for their

274
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,309
own purposes

275
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:26,399
even though it was not required by law
the link layer

276
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,360
on that specified by obd2 is

277
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,120
uses on this there's a free to the three
physical layers is that there's a

278
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,470
corresponding three-day link layers one
for each

279
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,980
but they have some church
characteristics are all half-duplex

280
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,259
sure buses basically they operate on a
carrier sense multiple access

281
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,610
paradigm I would have not destructive
collisions

282
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,350
so there's a priority in the packet
header thats as a system

283
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,439
design into the system arm and when

284
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,439
two messages are being transmit
simultaneously the higher party message

285
00:15:59,439 --> 00:15:59,860
will

286
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,049
be sent and you're very message will
detect that higher Perry message

287
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:03,689
overrode it

288
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:07,189
so there's no need to retransmit the
higher priority for missus

289
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:10,509
getting you to get through army loaded
by situations you don't

290
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,660
have a degradation of on the

291
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,139
the bandwidth available when when this
idealization the bus

292
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:21,790
%uh the network layer arm is a standard
network where for

293
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,949
all through the buses according to all
ready to there to addressing modes

294
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:31,149
as far as addressing controllers arm is
that the functional addressing

295
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,429
the server like abstract for you
function as

296
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:39,079
names as a function based addressing
issues for certain diagnostic or

297
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:43,689
calibration procedures and allows
manufactures have flexibility

298
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:46,689
in their implementation where in

299
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:51,040
one main factor may choose to implement
the and emissions diagnostics feature in

300
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
one unit were some other woodrow
distributed between three or four

301
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,569
and their functional dressing allows on

302
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:00,949
and off court unit 2 community with both
for those without having to have any

303
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:02,040
knowledge of whether or not

304
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,279
in his to talk to one or two or more
years on

305
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,638
anything like that and then the physical
dressing is is there a more standard

306
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:12,049
typeof network addressing or doctor
particular unit and that's

307
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,439
used more for things there very specific
to particular unit every

308
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,789
Lego programming memory in it or
something like that those IOU's from or

309
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,079
the manufacturer specific proprietary
table

310
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,928
cable operations and

311
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:30,000
the packet format has number diagnostic
codes

312
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,370
arm in the mods go out to by two run
tests

313
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,940
Korean sensor information control up its
other to

314
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,809
basically do troubleshooting and get
information from

315
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,690
different sensors and variety of formats
I'm 28 and in troubleshooting problems

316
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,740
vehicle on

317
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,270
there's a number data formats for a
diagnostic messages

318
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:56,490
and that allows different quantities to
be represented in a compact way

319
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,840
there's two sort around two dimensions

320
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,918
love the specification other data format
the first is

321
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:06,129
the scaling limit us that in Table the
slot

322
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:11,110
in that maps the the Rob its invites to
a meaningful magnitude

323
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,580
for example in a bit value could be very
represent -40

324
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,780
7.5 with have in .5 increments

325
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,480
or any pic I could represent a number of
other

326
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,730
sets in data as as a numbers but the the
slot specifies

327
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,100
how the magnitude is represented into a
a meaningful real world quantity

328
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,350
in the PRM parameter reference number

329
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,770
maps the data to an actual real-world

330
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,510
quantity itself where army references a
slight but also

331
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,450
at units and description I'm so that you
can actually

332
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,639
with both a slight appear and take a
piece of data and

333
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:52,179
matter to physical thing on the vehicle
is a wheel speed a particular we or

334
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:56,970
vehicles the or engine RPM

335
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,169
and on the diagnostic knows this is
basically the the harder the

336
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:01,539
functionality of the

337
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:05,289
the diagnostic features a obd2 there's
the

338
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:09,279
ability to request I'm a sensor
diagnostic data from it

339
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,590
this we getting the you know what the
curry things avatar

340
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,559
whether it's its inner outer thats
operating conditions were detected fall

341
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,980
itself

342
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,350
self-testing when I as ability to

343
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,770
have freeze-frame their ability to
basically you can search for your

344
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,770
with certain conditions are

345
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,360
are are met then this snapshot of a
number of different primers will be

346
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,169
stored

347
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:35,460
and I can be later I back for trying to
diagnose an intermittent

348
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,220
problem vehicle one on the freezer in
capabilities also

349
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,440
tied to some other diagnostic trouble
codes where

350
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,139
when a certain error occurs it'll also
store freeze frame data such that

351
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:50,379
you can determine what the values
particular sensors were relevance

352
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:51,289
answers 1

353
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:55,090
when a particular fall occurred you can
as a mention for

354
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:00,120
reading clear the TTC's when you have
some sort of all the vehicle

355
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,340
and you can also do on-board monitoring
diagnostic which is

356
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,100
it's like a real time drive around like
a drug test the vehicle

357
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,690
we can monitor systems lmao continuously
repair ok we get

358
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,480
be back from or on a polling place for
you profit when you want is information

359
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,779
but you can

360
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,299
drive around the vehicle and minor stuff
serve in real time as our operating it

361
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,010
to

362
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,299
for additional troubleshooting
capabilities

363
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,570
and other around some the other and what
little

364
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,799
somewhat less important diagnostic no
answer you can read the vehicle

365
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,980
information

366
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,639
such as the VIN calibration data memory
check sounds

367
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:42,049
and you can also upload and download
memories the scenes

368
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:46,289
the upland download member these issues
is not more things it's not mandated by

369
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:48,059
the

370
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,330
by the federal laws so the ability to do
that

371
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,949
particular issues may vary depending on
how to manufacture decided to implement

372
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,730
it or

373
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,309
influencer security safeguards in

374
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:03,510
so what type existing products are there
that

375
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,590
communicate with these buses and

376
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,860
majority won't talk about here are
products that

377
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,639
plug into the vehicle not products that
are in the vehicle itself

378
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,250
on the like by vehicle and has always
controllers and

379
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,960
what you plug into it too community with
the the network on the vehicle

380
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,760
there's a proprietary full interface
products that very functional very

381
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,320
expensive than the ones dealers have to
do

382
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,780
everything they can program everything
they can calibrate everything

383
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,850
on the King to every little detail about
everything but they're on the order of

384
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,909
tens of thousands of dollars

385
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:40,980
there's also the complete devices that
are

386
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,780
basically put between a laptop and
vehicle and they do

387
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,649
you know a little bit there will be less
functional the generally do the standard

388
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:50,600
diagnostic procedures

389
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,960
and that's about it there's pounds in
three incher worst terror

390
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,669
there is proprietary and some shareware
free software that will communicate with

391
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:00,540
it but they really that's a lot less
functional

392
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,899
proprietary type systems and the the
hardware for those

393
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:09,210
is on your a hundred poems thousand
dollars

394
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,770
is also components that implement one or
more the individual buses and

395
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,879
those are you nor what's more components
are for ten dollars

396
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:21,200
arm is actually a couple the AM
interesting free designs that

397
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,730
allow you to with just a handful about
parts already Shack

398
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,020
basically community place report from a
laptop into the

399
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,090
ISO interface because the data link
layer for the ISO interfaces

400
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,720
are fairly similar similar enough to
serial for a computer that you could

401
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,470
just

402
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,619
with them some physical matching you can
its before to rate and

403
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:45,159
so whatever software products are
available

404
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,770
as a number of commercial and I share
our products available

405
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,530
for most %uh this offer products 10
months after products there

406
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,460
the the the required functionality

407
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,770
for the the federal mandates as most
common support

408
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,490
arms of them have additional
functionality for particular

409
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,899
manufactures but

410
00:23:03,899 --> 00:23:07,780
on very few of them have the full
support for

411
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,960
calibrating region with every vehicle
area controller vehicle

412
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,250
with things such as caliber air
suspension and try to control one of

413
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,649
those types and features are

414
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:19,710
not available sometimes the they have
the

415
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,429
main factors specific diagnostic
information but not necessarily

416
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:26,740
to calibrate and set up futures

417
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,559
pro-free tag arm is a is free software
implementation scandal basically

418
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:36,020
I'm it supports a diagnostic procedures
mandated for it will be too

419
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,210
and it also includes a few diagnostic
procedures for some

420
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,309
vehicles umpire Jerry diagnostic
features but

421
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:46,950
that's about it there's no nothing
beyond the diagnostics

422
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,549
fly as as the name suggests

423
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,668
on so open auto on this project I've
been working on

424
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:58,980
it's a hardware little bit a hardware
and most software to implement these

425
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,080
protocols

426
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,619
on the hardware is a another serves real
porn a PC to the

427
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:09,639
ISO bus interface comments just a little
bit little variation on the

428
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:14,080
size are out there is in smaller
components a bit more reliable

429
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,490
think arm you know a bit cheaper

430
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,549
and is also working on a repurposed

431
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:23,929
USB Serial Adapter where and US beer

432
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,909
RS 232 dogle can be

433
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:31,230
reprogram the firm going to be
reprogrammed actually do more than just

434
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,609
the ISO bus but actually can do all
three of the

435
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:38,500
desi required by Cincy community with
any vehicle

436
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:43,570
with that that sir aftermarket firmware
for the answer or they open on a firmer

437
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,460
for the answer or device

438
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,500
and the majority the work has been on
the software

439
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,970
trying to implement a standard

440
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,190
layer 2 and layer 3 network stack the
the

441
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,389
the link layer in the network layer such
that

442
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:04,049
the on developing applications as I
require starting from Sir the ground up

443
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,879
develop talking to the devices all the
way up to your user interface seeking

444
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:11,169
sir star with your your generic network
interface and move up from there

445
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:14,899
very similar to the on trying to model
the API after

446
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:19,599
standard network stacks for TCP IP in
one night in modern a license so that

447
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,189
take advantage over using code using the
networks tax because thats

448
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,840
should be the same through you know any
type of application but it tends to be

449
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,099
reimplemented because most the products
or commercial

450
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:35,869
by Terry I'm and also working on to
applications offer but thats moreover

451
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,720
serve a secondary goal to the creating
the library the

452
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,260
so the generic library to implementing
our seconds is all

453
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,230
free Sovereign Harbour most GPO

454
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,090
other network stack it's a common API
cross

455
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,409
all the networks the sports curly

456
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:59,250
the declare just supports the ISO
because that's the hardware have so far

457
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,539
but on working on the USB adapter the
whole provide the PWM PWM support

458
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:07,919
and then can is something like to
support my future that's

459
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,260
seems to be where the most vehicles are
going as far as

460
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,119
where the interesting never
communications on vehicles

461
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,359
from the link where sports the obd2
protocol

462
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,770
and in our players for COPD protocol and
a little bit

463
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,270
some other manufactures extensions but

464
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,070
its intended that this could be a
expanded where the physical the link in

465
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,619
our players could support

466
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,960
on very whatever's out there and
continue to support the

467
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,990
the common API to develop the library

468
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,869
suffer from the complications among
Labour sports a bus applications with

469
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:44,059
transparently also support that bus

470
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:48,609
I'm in some the applications on is more
brainstorming haven't been around

471
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:52,460
haven't started yet but I'm there you
know scandals or

472
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,480
like a baseline application would do the

473
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,309
by diagnostic features that are required
by mandated by the

474
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:02,908
federal law for obd2

475
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:06,570
network probing logging tool adding
something to be interesting to know

476
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:11,928
the plywood vehicle because things like
TCP down to just done packets and map to

477
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:15,359
scan for addresses in scan for

478
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,139
in a protocol supported by different
nodes and one night

479
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:23,020
like to explore vehicle and try to
identified the

480
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,679
you know unknown parts to the network
and

481
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,950
reverse engineer the protocols and what
not to support

482
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,039
eventually support although you know all
the features a

483
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,070
have any vehicle out there

484
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,070
um the approach taken by most to the

485
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,049
automotive networking tools is tend to
be more

486
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:47,330
serving automotive approach to wear they
don't apply the typeof

487
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:51,359
on networking network analysis tools
that are using more

488
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,020
the wide area network someone I think
that that's that's our the

489
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:59,099
the interesting feature that open autos
trying to

490
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:02,109
trying to bring to these are more
networks is that the as a game or more

491
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:03,799
complex there

492
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:08,240
starring to become more more like lands
end-women's

493
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,580
and I think that the tools that use
there will be very useful also on the

494
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,189
vehicle

495
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:19,149
and then server as a additional serve
different direction to take it as

496
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:22,799
on some high level monitoring and
control on would be

497
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,780
available on possible expanded
diagnostics I'm we could have some sort

498
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,200
of

499
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,109
on in bill computer on the vehicle that
would continually

500
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:35,270
and analyze sensors around more advanced
and houses on

501
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,049
sensor inputs and

502
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,408
determine failures long before the
sensors will determine that they failed

503
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:40,809
err

504
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:45,209
for the which is completely stops
working to be able to log

505
00:28:45,209 --> 00:28:48,809
whatever's going on your vehicle on for
whatever purpose is for diagnostics

506
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:49,779
troubleshooting for

507
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:55,039
development proving whatever and he was
amiss in a simple as a

508
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,589
confer W I for your detailed dashboard
where you can

509
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:03,079
provide all your gauges and sticking LCD
and have themes for you know each driver

510
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,918
can have a different skin for how they
want their

511
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,349
their dashboard to looking you know have
whatever information is available on me

512
00:29:09,349 --> 00:29:13,948
on on the diagnostic personal vehicle

513
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:17,739
and so here's a I'm just a few
references that

514
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:20,839
there for two innings the talk their
zone

515
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:24,678
the on-board diagnostics relay million
new vehicles there's many of the

516
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,869
a CA just three thousand that's
basically the there's a book a standards

517
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:29,489
that

518
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:33,269
for SE zone specifications for all these
are already

519
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:37,279
two protocols Mon free diags a

520
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,099
free software that implements the
scandal basically

521
00:29:41,099 --> 00:29:44,718
Armenian open auto that is an attempt to

522
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:49,909
you know have a an open network stack an
open API for a developing

523
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:53,279
are very different applications one to
our community

524
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,869
vehicle so I guess I'm

525
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:03,190
that about apps yeah I'm going to open
up the questions and special thing when

526
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,319
as I think Mike from here background
thank you

527
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:13,489
okay up question and that to the airbag
crash sensors at one time other than urs

528
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:14,289
our way to

529
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:18,849
rock wary that ur to disprove it um well

530
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:22,079
it is a one-time event the from the

531
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,749
this the airbag um the crash data
recorder will only

532
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:29,899
I mean a diploma then can only occur
once because once the air bags of

533
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:34,079
you need to be replaced the air bag so
that server a static thing that the

534
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,649
the the Press data recorder needs to be
reset after that occurs

535
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:41,619
the non deployment event arm I don't
know

536
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:44,190
there's there's not a lot of standards
on that but I believe that they they

537
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,679
either

538
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,219
only record the first arm serve not
climate event for the record the most

539
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:51,079
severe where they continue to replace a
single

540
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:54,469
non deployment event with something is
deemed to be more severe

541
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:57,989
event but that also sits in the vehicle
and stays there until

542
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,269
its reset or the the modules replace

543
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:06,589
so is our way to send it false data that
the car is going 0 miles an hour

544
00:31:06,589 --> 00:31:09,869
miles an hour yet but the mean that's
entirely possible on

545
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:14,089
you can there's a number ways I can be
done you could on he could potentially

546
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:15,059
put some sorta

547
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:18,869
on bridge in between the diagnostic
connector and the vehicle so that you

548
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:19,179
don't

549
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:23,629
spoof the fresh data recorder you spoof
the person downloading information from

550
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:24,709
the crash data recorder

551
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:28,719
um and then there's also the depending
on how the vehicles implemented where

552
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:32,869
where those pieces of information such
as the vehicle speeder the

553
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:38,459
drivers seatbelt latch censor what not
over those who communicate as a bride a

554
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,190
different way that those can be
communicated to the crash data recorder

555
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,429
and depending on you know any those ways
could be potentially spoof that could be

556
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,539
as simple as just cutting wire and
shorting

557
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,129
the the mechanical reed switch sensor
that sense is that a

558
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:55,190
life has been pushed or I'm you know
disconnecting your vehicle speed sensor

559
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,249
so that your speedometer reads 0 and
everything else texas goes our miles an

560
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,109
hour and so

561
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:02,989
that's what gets sent to the Crestor or
so righty ways that could be addressed

562
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:05,109
but the implementation to be very
different so

563
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:10,169
to be depending on the vehicle
picnickers

564
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:14,049
home how much bandwidth is needed for
the ECU to commit to

565
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:16,849
to talk to the year like fuel injectors
and stuff because those are opening

566
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:18,079
closing really fast

567
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,690
isolated talking like real time in all
those stares at you were talking about

568
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,129
public

569
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:25,559
really low about a band with like 10
tibbetts per second something like that

570
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:26,129
right

571
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:29,749
will that the on the three over the two
buses

572
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:33,799
are only for diagnostic purposes so
they're not actually used for real time

573
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:36,149
communication vehicle subsystem so

574
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:40,319
for example the the messages to open or
close the fuel injectors wouldn't be

575
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,449
on that bus and actually that is usually

576
00:32:43,449 --> 00:32:46,599
not even on the bus the M there's a a an
engine can

577
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:50,259
engine unit that controls fuel injectors
and that basically has wires that can

578
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,499
to go straight to the soul is a common
to control its joint actors the

579
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:54,219
information

580
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:57,289
the real time information may be
communicated is on

581
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:00,719
you know a sync signal for every every
timing around the

582
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:03,799
you know its owner on the aircraft after
whatever in that would synchronize

583
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,450
mother

584
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,779
parts in the vehicle or speed sensor
will be then sent to the

585
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:12,139
engine control every periodically area
10 times a second or something like that

586
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:12,609
too

587
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:16,729
change how we would do the fuel mixture
but something for me that nature would

588
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:19,909
wood is done by just the same way to
wire the computer there

589
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,649
the talks in the bus but as far as the
timing goes it this time closer into the

590
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:27,940
fuel injectors runs on several wire

591
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,989
a crisp your would you be able to run
the vehicle using

592
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:35,649
the networks that like accelerating

593
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,899
breaking turning um depending on the
vehicle

594
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:42,789
you can um actually the vehicle I Drive
which is a 2003

595
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:45,919
vehicle everything except for the
steering wheel can be controlled over

596
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:46,619
the

597
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:50,769
not necessarily over the diagnostic bus
but over the CAN bus because

598
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:53,849
arm the pedal is just the switch in the

599
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:57,579
gear shift is just the switch so from
everything is on my transmission

600
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:01,168
obviously so yeah you could potentially
control

601
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:08,119
majority of the vehicle over these buses

602
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,190
as year what sorta physical there or

603
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,099
physical protocol was the can that work
working on I'm can that work

604
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:18,450
is um it's a twisted pair on its

605
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:22,359
500 kilobits arm and

606
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:25,409
yet to spare copper I like typography
what certain

607
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:29,559
with a proper protocol to route we
talking here I'm walkin bus also is a

608
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,539
share bus

609
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:36,049
um so it's a serve after Plex bus with a
priority scheme in the dressing to

610
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:39,639
prevent collisions on and as far as the

611
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,119
the topology the network cover CAN bus
that would really be up to the

612
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,829
manufacturer's there's some

613
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:48,039
there's there's different ways you can
use the cam bus to

614
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:51,039
provides our bridges and switches and
whatnot but since that's not

615
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,450
standardized flips the manufacturer to
do it

616
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:56,518
whenever they see fit

617
00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:00,029
X between the your BT you BD

618
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:03,420
to bus cars & sepsis oh yeah

619
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,339
I actually I'm a number the vehicles
have on the ability to

620
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:11,288
reprogram or observe calibrate the a
fair system

621
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,609
we can either disable it or you can if
you get a new key

622
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:18,839
you have to cover it new key to the onto
the system you can do that through the

623
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,630
to the diagnostic bus but again that's
not a

624
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,029
it's not standardized because not many
by the government so some

625
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:29,000
manufactures use these buses for
features like that but there are

626
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,710
required to and they may do on a canvas
and they may have their own proprietary

627
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,950
way we're

628
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,129
you plug in directly to any issue or
something like that

629
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,029
at one time I had a Taurus shom it had

630
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:44,559
we get going faster car computer cut the
engine of

631
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,670
with such is going too fast with with
its offer can you modify the

632
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,739
settings on a car Computerworld keep on
going on

633
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:56,289
much for the engine name yeah I mean
that's one of the arm

634
00:35:56,289 --> 00:36:00,130
10 things I applications I think via a
great you so this is that

635
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:05,299
um those probably done by software
running on the

636
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:09,849
the controller to the engine and I made
cuts fuel to the fuel injectors when

637
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:13,250
to get sense that's gets messages it
says its peers over a particular

638
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,970
limit so if you could rewrite that
software you could changed to everyone

639
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:17,420
to not

640
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,059
particular limit and from being able to

641
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:23,549
that's that's something that that
manufactures a broad are very

642
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:26,170
tight-lipped about and the prime not
gonna

643
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:29,940
make available very easily or without
very expensive

644
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,720
in a licensing agreement NDA so Italy is
gonna fry need to be reverse-engineered

645
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,049
if one wants a

646
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:39,299
download a memory dump and figure out
University near to be able to change so

647
00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:43,650
to something like that but it would be
possible

648
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,730
as two part question is it possible

649
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,109
I to actually download all the code that
stored in their module

650
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:55,720
to laptop modify a possibly by a reform
in rio

651
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,390
loaded and have it you know be able to
run is it stored their way on the module

652
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,670
yeah on some vehicles that's not a on
yes or number via a lot actually love

653
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,819
Eagles thats

654
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:10,140
that's very possible thing to do
sometimes check sums and some other

655
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,348
um security features that you need to
answer jump through the

656
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:17,529
the security feature specified by obd2
is used by some manufacturers to prevent

657
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,739
you from even downloading

658
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,900
the memory at all but once you get
through those those

659
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,259
those procedures whatever they own have
in the way then

660
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:28,960
yes that's that's definitely possible
okay in on that same line is it possible

661
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,520
to

662
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,609
modify things such as variables

663
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:37,700
in memory in real time while the cars
running

664
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,770
such as adjusting the timing fuel
injectors

665
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,829
are going or something like that um that
I'm not sure I believe

666
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:49,020
that that would probably very specific
depending on the

667
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,420
um the implementation of the vehicle
whether it

668
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,549
it used the so the program stored in
memory to initialize it state

669
00:37:56,549 --> 00:38:00,009
and then reviews the central stay as I
was running or if it

670
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:03,059
worked on that a real time but that's
definitely something that would be

671
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:03,759
awesome

672
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:07,480
an interesting thing to explore with the
ability to produce that works

673
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,609
in the scenario you mentioned before
which was a essentially drive by wire

674
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:16,799
I accelerator et cetera controlled by
switches rather mechanical linkage

675
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,849
what kinda failsafe certain place at the
campus fails

676
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:24,289
from much have it some it's a

677
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:27,750
it's a arm months ago it's it's a

678
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,299
differential bus so there's a little bit
ovum

679
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:35,259
in additional reliability in the bus
because that but from

680
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:39,339
there really is not a lot but I think
there's some probably cut out if certain

681
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:42,469
sensors fail to respond but on

682
00:38:42,469 --> 00:38:45,099
there's a number of things people have
done when certain parts of it have

683
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,529
actually failed in a way that prevents
them from

684
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:50,710
on shifting their vehicle into drive
because it thinks that the brake is

685
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,339
applied even that's not and so my the
prevents the gearshift

686
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:57,270
moving doesn't move so if you're short
oh tail light it allows you to open its

687
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,930
army

688
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,489
there's not a tremendous amount over
above

689
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:05,219
you know the paper lively final like
fighter plane to fly by wire

690
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:09,020
anything like that

691
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,700
um yeah I don't I don't know that
there's some I mean that's really within

692
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,160
the reason to be able to

693
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,700
and detect that and you know

694
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,529
do something about that have some search
heuristics for feel safe on that but

695
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:25,719
and I believe the way them though army
defectors address those

696
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:29,719
by makings providing individual
components that are

697
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:33,380
basically reliable enough and then and
hope they don't fail I mean

698
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,289
some his control features are not are
not done entirely over the can-bus

699
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:40,559
it's not like the accelerator pedal be
plugged into the can-bus

700
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,559
and then the you know there should be
plugged into the cam bus

701
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:46,789
and then the controllers runoff that
it's more like there's a

702
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:50,930
maybe a half a dozen controllers and the
accelerator runs to same control the

703
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,069
runs are fuel injectors so if you're

704
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:56,558
accelerator got stuck or if the campus
one out

705
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,549
then maybe you're a light breaks when
work as effectively as they used to work

706
00:39:59,549 --> 00:39:59,960
but

707
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,520
your sorry was to control your your fuel
injectors and if you are up to it still

708
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,880
shut off even if you're

709
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,289
a light breaks thought you were going
100 miles an hour

710
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:12,640
earlier there was mention about storing
crash date in the controller

711
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,558
the airbag in we're having a discussion
about

712
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,190
somebody trying to you courts for trying
to use that data to incriminate

713
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,469
driver user been any discussion or
decisions on

714
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:27,039
who owns that data and whether you know
is like

715
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,730
Amendment implications not that I know
of um

716
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,759
you actually my wife is a is a lawyer
and you might wanna talk to her I'll be

717
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:37,009
with her afterwards if you want to I'm
talk about the legal implications are

718
00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:38,150
that but I am

719
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:41,969
summer the investigations I tried to do
as far as the crash data recorder

720
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:45,279
have been met with you can have that
information if you're not

721
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:48,910
a mechanic or if you buy this photo as
intellectual or if your law enforcement

722
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:49,920
so

723
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,349
I don't think that those discussions are
the people that have the equipment to

724
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:57,549
work on this in for working the ISM
these controllers

725
00:40:57,549 --> 00:41:00,400
they were rather not have those
discussions I think it seems to me that

726
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,859
they'd rather have it in their

727
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,569
and then pull it out when some you know
drunk driver hits a baby

728
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:08,750
and say is in the great we had surfer
mation to prove that you know some real

729
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,140
bad guy was really bad

730
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,109
and then at that point it's like all
these are you bringing your cars for ten

731
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,890
years so

732
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,250
you know what do you have to complain
about their other night discussion

733
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:22,650
beforehand when people would actually
get upset about it

734
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:26,400
um something like it's it's it most
people don't know there is there and you

735
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,130
can get the

736
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,599
if you want to I mean you can't feasibly
get the data if you want to you can

737
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,920
technically if you pay a lot of money
for a

738
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,190
you know the tool to communicate to it
but on it's just somewhat

739
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,710
its intentionally made it impractical
for an individual to gather data

740
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:48,710
to know the data is and to be able to
control over the data goes

741
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,710
or less

742
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:57,410
black glass questions it's making me
think that with them

743
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,890
on star it would make it possible for an
on-board computer

744
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,618
to immediately transmit through OnStar

745
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:08,759
the fact that you'd have iraq I guess
they already do that

746
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,430
yeah I believe they do that that's part
of the measures have OnStar right back

747
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,940
he more detailed information such as the
fact that you were weaving and going

748
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,719
eighty seven and fifty

749
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,630
and so forth absolutely a that that's
there was only nine

750
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,799
the questions started out with her a
there was just based on the previous

751
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:29,819
people talking I won't ask if

752
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:33,690
it's possible to turn off features you
don't want

753
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:37,969
for instance and when I put my is a
general motors 2001

754
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:41,520
car gonna put it in drive from Park

755
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,059
the lights come on headlight serving
daytime running lights whatever they

756
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:45,819
call

757
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:49,950
their situations where he might not
necessarily want their

758
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,589
like in the movie Fargo they had to
drive in darkness

759
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:57,069
for few for a few seconds also

760
00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:00,660
on is there any way to shield

761
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,618
the on-board computer I I considered
wrapping it in aluminum foil

762
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,849
I really don't know how to do it to stop
the

763
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:12,020
blip blip you know that's on your arm

764
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:16,759
keychain remote unlocks the doors and
popped the trunk and all about

765
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:20,509
I want to shield that receiving unit

766
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:25,430
from receiving any radio signals because
I do not use my

767
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,730
and

768
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:31,650
were remote thing I locked them in a
drawer I don't I just use a key

769
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,490
like it so nineteen seventies car
something and so

770
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,600
a if somebody were to ever have a clone

771
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,880
have a radio device that can open my
doors I don't want their

772
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,940
radio signal to be able to invade my car

773
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,090
is that something that you a dresser is
that

774
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,990
um thats summer those things could be
from could be addressed by

775
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,460
reprogram the controllers you could um
basically

776
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,680
remove the functionality that responded
to um

777
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,290
you know from wrist messenger si you
know where receives a

778
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:07,300
transmission on the the antenna for
their remote

779
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,560
door openers or whatever um as far as
actually preventing it from

780
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,110
being received in the first place I
think that would be more of a hardware

781
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:20,670
on type a solution we need to do find
the antenna and disconnected or grounded

782
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,760
or just cut the wires something like
that to just

783
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,020
completely prevent it from being being
received as far as being able to easily

784
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,340
reprogram those things its right now
it's not possible to easily do that

785
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,020
for an individual because the
information is sir held in a lock and

786
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,380
key by the manufactures

787
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,050
on and that's you know what I hope to
encourage with this is people to be able

788
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,580
to reverse-engineer the

789
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:48,450
the you know the them the software on
their vehicle so that they can

790
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,570
on you know release free implementations
oath a new software for your vehicle

791
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:53,070
that

792
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,270
doesn't have this feature gives you
programmability a couple other features

793
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,790
its the state that I'm in the

794
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:02,900
as part of your missions test the query
your OB

795
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,030
computer at the Mission testing station
is there some way to say

796
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,119
to the state my cars wrinkling even

797
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:14,030
mean absolutely that some if you can

798
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,070
um part of what um

799
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:20,300
what the open auto project is is trying
to

800
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,380
produces a ability to communicate on
these buses and is not

801
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,390
a diagnostic unit

802
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:31,470
centric typeof network stack it sits
moreover generic thing so you could

803
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,600
uses to make a small micro controller
based system

804
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,970
put it under dash and

805
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,910
it possibly with a switcher something
where you could enable

806
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,390
the real bus when you want to
communicate to you know

807
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:46,040
your mechanic and you can enable some
other bus when you wanted other

808
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,020
information to come out every diagnostic
connector for whatever purpose

809
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,470
on so that's definitely something it
could be possible as well

810
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:56,860
okay I like to point out died and
mapping your can buzz is all well and

811
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:57,600
good but your

812
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,120
airbags large electrically ignite an
explosive charge

813
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,779
pointed at your face please be careful I
you know

814
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,470
arm learn learned the failure modes
these things when

815
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:12,560
when you when you tear drop them and
crashed them

816
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,990
before sitting in the driver's arm
second of it like to find out

817
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,640
down how do things like on star receiver
transmitter

818
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,029
connect to the rest at the up the
vehicle is that

819
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:28,840
over this bus is that something else I
i've been

820
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,280
I'm done any investigation as far as how
OnStar works but I I would presume that

821
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,680
you use the cam bus or something similar
perhaps the campus is not presented to

822
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,509
the connector but

823
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,520
is internal to the vehicle on but I'm
not sure because I'm done

824
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,490
done any research on the OnStar system I
just want to follow up on the question

825
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,880
before regarding the use

826
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,260
the the black box data

827
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:58,020
within criminal proceeds are actually
was cases wasn't Michigan

828
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,070
earlier this year where guy was

829
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,490
I found to have been driving something
like 105 miles an hour

830
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,140
and 35 been slammed into a parked car
killing

831
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,270
believe three people inside leave the
use that data to levy

832
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:19,270
higher charges against him

833
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:25,829
interests

834
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:28,260
where to begin

835
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,760
on first of the yessir estate in

836
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,190
the outside the airbag data in is that
read

837
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,829
threw up so it's a circular buffer no

838
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:41,859
there's the store 19 deployment event

839
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,950
one deployment event the cause the air
bags deployed in one

840
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,099
redeployment event that's basically
severity of the deployment event but

841
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,240
after the air bags of

842
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,430
air base Camry inflate so it's kinda not
redeployment is kind of a misnomer but

843
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:57,960
that's essential resources just three
values the none deployment is replaced

844
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,059
by a more severe

845
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:02,339
month women event in some vehicles if
thats how to implement

846
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:06,119
arm to your body clearing houses for the
data

847
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,190
that a prosecutor lawyer would use says
these are the cars that this black box

848
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,710
data is available from

849
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:14,890
has a prosecutor know that he might have
the seven build

850
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:19,049
as far as I know there's only one
manufacture called that Tronix the makes

851
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,720
a a device that can read this
information and on their web site they

852
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,470
list all the vehicles at their

853
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:28,690
there there are tools is compatible with
so I don't know that's a comprehensive

854
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,750
list of all the vehicles I have that
information but as far as I know that's

855
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,089
a

856
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:36,029
the only those two vehicles at their
devices available that you can get there

857
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,369
we'll get the information out so

858
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:41,280
practically those are the only vehicles
applies to again sorry last question

859
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,440
on is that the obd2 systems they can
potentially store the

860
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,430
vehicle identification number yes they
do and they definitely do

861
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,529
you pretty short over there it's
definitely part of the spectrum that's

862
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,440
required by

863
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,530
federal laws far as the federal partners
are the specification rate so if you're

864
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:01,210
being clever in turning around emissions
and you have your body plug his car

865
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,569
into the state-run vehicle missions

866
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:07,690
program they're gonna find out assuming
that they

867
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,069
log the VM through that method yes
potentially

868
00:49:11,069 --> 00:49:17,049
your ok this would be

869
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:20,710
potentially really are great for
small-time mechanics

870
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:25,099
to get around me having spent thousand
dollars these large units to

871
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:28,240
do all the stuff do you know if there's
patents

872
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,520
that these car manufacturers have to
stop are the small-time

873
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,970
arm fabricator for making

874
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:41,049
units on the Chi as far as I know there

875
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:45,250
um I'm not aware many times I believe me
the majority the interesting information

876
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:45,609
is

877
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:49,140
probably protected by trade secrets
because they would rather no one knows

878
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:49,750
it all

879
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,630
then a patent where they could prevent
you from using it but he would be

880
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,059
available on the

881
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,599
US PTO's website where you can you can
get access to it

882
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,150
I think they're more interested in
preventing access to it then protecting

883
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,510
a revenue stream that I'm a generator
whatever else

884
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,990
ok it now as being a trade secret arm

885
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:10,240
do for see this up open are having
problems with the DMCA

886
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,680
um there could be some potential um

887
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,029
liability there begin my wife can
probably feel those questions better

888
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,440
that his lawyer and

889
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,920
desire to help me out to give me a on
the right side of the law

890
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,920
and she can perhaps answer some of your
more questions about that all the stuff

891
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:30,700
that you're talking about here

892
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,730
is it area this real-world information
that you've done

893
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:38,280
result are no the arm the network stack

894
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,780
I have implemented um and the these
simple

895
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,559
certain American to face I have also
implemented on their available for

896
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:46,740
download on the website

897
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:49,780
arm the the more advanced on

898
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,470
serve protocols and applications and
whatnot are are

899
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,690
novel implement the others are just in
planning stages so with all the

900
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,960
questions all that conceptual yes

901
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,109
yes because the the state the open auto
is that is an API it's a programmer

902
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:04,790
there's no

903
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,650
is no user useful applications yet it's
it's an API

904
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,299
the you can use the library to use to
develop his application so

905
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:15,619
it's more of a developed is more
interesting to developers you know

906
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:22,619
I'm practically at this moment on have
you done any work with aftermarket

907
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:28,740
ECU's and everything like that on as far
as getting past lockers and just

908
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,319
replacing the entire ECU

909
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,529
I can be managed no I haven't I haven't
had

910
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:38,440
on the porch they don't have a ability
to get access to a lot over these issues

911
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,490
on don't really have the money to go buy
a whole lot on on the 1i so this guy

912
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:49,290
just have my own vehicle to experiment
with their last question

913
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:54,640
for the diagnostics it was in the next
logical step

914
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,359
the connector would be some sort
Wireless implementation are you wear

915
00:51:58,359 --> 00:52:02,089
any work on this by automotive
manufacturers with SAE

916
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:06,009
there's actually I'm there's discussion
about on the bill as he live discussion

917
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,190
about the most concrete

918
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:10,839
I've seen as far as a on-board
diagnostics three or whatever would

919
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:15,480
answer supersede on burdine asked to on
this actually statements on the

920
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,460
California Air resource board website
which is basically the

921
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,720
on they kinda instigate the EPA to make
on

922
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,680
meet federal standards the the have
these environmental regulations

923
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,859
they've actually made statements the
effect love having a convenience feature

924
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:31,630
where

925
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,400
your only the vehicles that are or
perform a function a required for

926
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,650
inspections with some sort of wireless

927
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:41,349
I'm sleeping at the vehicles that have
Eunos big make sure your

928
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:45,140
make sure sensors are always working up
to spec and only the vehicles that don't

929
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:45,950
have that

930
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,670
are get letters in the mail or whatever
to come in for inspection so

931
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:53,329
on there's definitely very real and very
real being discussed by the

932
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:56,290
California Air resource board which
basically inspires the EPA to make

933
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:59,619
federal laws

934
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:02,000
so I guess that's it work
