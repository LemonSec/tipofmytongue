17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:17,190
found that should go logical

18
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,710
stalling this on a computer does not

19
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:27,259

20
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,450
well I know they they are all print out
the website see this isn't a printout of

21
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,320
a website

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,259
this is Arnold Schwarzenegger campaign
literature

23
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,820
if a rather if they're everything really
2010

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:43,869
for ecological reasons to act like

25
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:50,869
junk mail this is yet this

26
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,090
to be alone gonna pass legal muster to
save your send unsolicited crap in the

27
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,030
mail to somebody

28
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,849
they can all be on a three-by-five card
and then if they want the whole catalog

29
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:03,739
they spend the card back

30
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,130
and get it instead of getting all your
stuff in the mail

31
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,500
the term strategies in my state into
book turns

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,020
yeah with my state he stepped resign
amid a manscape said everything I have

33
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,900
the ad campaign literature ever saw fish
rots in a grim look red thick reading it

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,989
is still

35
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:26,810
I had to be path planner

36
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,010
I have I left me with a backpack for

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,810

38
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,989

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,019
California back what does BAC mean

42
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:53,969
at yeah exactly a an end lol what is the
love has no

43
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,099
fiscally conservative government with
republican principles

44
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:03,810
Republican principles oxymoron if I've
ever heard one

45
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,749
repealed outrageous car tax increase
which I got a three dollar refund for

46
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:13,310
basically this this was in a recall
election

47
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,040
it was ok who and granted the governor
before that I gray davis was not very

48
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,969
sympathetic figure kinda

49
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,629
the East Bay Ray have politics if you
well he

50
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:31,629
the up I your right-wing corporate clint
no I Democrat who opt with Motley Oh

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,939
like typical Democrats have today with
more interested in making deals than

52
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:37,090
being a leader

53
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,749
and eventually it caught up with him and
now they've got him again this is very

54
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:43,159
important for two reasons

55
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,879
now bush has the new state to Chi Dian

56
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,319
this fall because they might be watching
Florida little more closely

57
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,969
and the lead governor day both
lieutenant governor clinton Cruz

58
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,019
Bustamante

59
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,010
had filed $89 billion dollar lawsuit

60
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,170
against an Ron and Kenneth Lay

61
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,999
for ripping off our state in the
corporate staged

62
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:12,620
energy crisis but since the state
attorney general's office didn't file it

63
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,870
and the governor dead

64
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,920
the governor can withdraw the lawsuit at
his pleasure

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,109
and fellow stoner Schwarzenegger got an
and he had been meeting behind closed

66
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,479
doors with people I kenneth lay

67
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,810
michael milken and others before the
recall ever got started

68
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,070
you know that I gotta do to save nine
billion dollars in pirate booty

69
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,510
his pay a few tens of millions and
change the governor

70
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,620
and that's what they did schwarzenegger
quietly

71
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,910
settled with and Ron out-of-court for
nothing

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,810
as far as I know that's the real reason
he then

73
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,230
years business as usual in California

74
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,940
more junk mail recently appeared this
one

75
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,920
says dear friend crossed out

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,860
in machine marking shallow will you
become one of the first

77
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,440
to join the bush-cheney team is a
charter member of California

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,900
I'll be three had to tell the president
you were with earth

79
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,290
so thrilled we even have a fake
autographed photo

80
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,630
addressed personally to me thank you
plan on a commitment and dedication it I

81
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,480
remember to campaign California

82
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,420
grassroots leaders lucky you I the key
to building a winning team

83
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,230
to win back our country from this
fascist cowboy pay for clay

84
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:46,230
the

85
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,250
anyway imagine you know it I but
everything's gonna be on website they've

86
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,690
got to be downloaded and

87
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,290
what happens if the whole thing crashes
or disappears I had somebody you

88
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,630
spent years writing to film scripts or
his life's work

89
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,060
only had on a hard drive guess what got
stolen out of his car

90
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,310
and he didn't have backup copies I mean

91
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,870
cyberterrorism is a legitimate fear it
time so if you don't wanna lose some

92
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,430
that's important to you

93
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,570
back it up on something other than just

94
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,420
the digital netherworld in all you could
regret it later

95
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,360
but I am touched with the nostalgic Cup

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,160
as Daljit packaging this time around we
have 1980 for over a year and

97
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,900
I even got one of these little
perforated cards they never thought I'd

98
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,810
see one of those again

99
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,930
reminding me of those good old haha days
in high school

100
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,640
when I was called into the counselors of
Earth and told it was time to plan my

101
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,310
career

102
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,360
and to fill out a little multiple-choice
format what might interests and skills

103
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,140
were

104
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,760
which I filled out you know modestly
death my ability

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,770
in a while later one of these cards came
back that only counselors could read

106
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,969
apparently

107
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,440
and if that I should spend my high
school years preparing to be calm

108
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,250
a dental hygiene assistant

109
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,830
imagine how I'm often I visited that
counselor in the future at all

110
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,060
when I first came here in 2000

111
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,130
things were sold comparatively

112
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,510
in a third int compared to what we have
now

113
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,680
all you had to worry about was getting
your hand slapped a fine for the most

114
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,830
part I've

115
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,530
illegally supposedly sharing software
downloading music

116
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,470
ring around the Rosie with high you
can't catch me I'm the gingerbread man

117
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,480
and freeing kevin Mitnick

118
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,820
not anymore many more

119
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,320
kevin mitnick's in jail now and I don't
mean to downgrade what happened to him

120
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,380
which never should have happened in any
way

121
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,190
but now what have we got but job you
know those

122
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,910
deadly almost a thousand people being
held without bail without trial can't

123
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,700
talk to a lawyer in their family

124
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,460
now that we've gone into the
concentration camp business

125
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,840
in Guantanamo Bay another 10,000

126
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,180
held incommunicado in Iraq and we've
heard how some %uh

127
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,078
there may have been treated and another
seven hundred-plus

128
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,820
still being held without trial were
there without a hearing

129
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,120
in this country who were rounded up
after September 11th

130
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,339
and they just threw away the key locking
them up

131
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:48,529
just in today's they might be

132
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,350
a terrorist if they get away with this
now

133
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,630
look do they come like she just threw
this way should night

134
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,000
who do they come for next

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,170
couple days ago we hit the 1000 mark

136
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,939
in dad Americans killed in Iraq

137
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,220
but of course in our happy news for
happy people happy problems on TV they

138
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,499
don't mention

139
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:14,800
that we've killed somewhere around
20,000

140
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,740
or more iraqis not to mention

141
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,720
the death toll from the sanctions we had
on that country from

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,139
go for number one until we went in again

143
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:30,389
starving people depriving above
medicines for children were dying over

144
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:32,379
these Lee preventable diseases

145
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:36,930
is diarrhea estimated death toll from
those sanctions between

146
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,930
one and two million

147
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,019
people that's not fighting terrorism
that's not liberating anybody that is

148
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,740
genocide

149
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:53,069
and that's how people view of us in that
part of the world

150
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:56,769
and another thing they don't bother to
tell you is

151
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,980
okay we only lost two thousand guys and
look how we kicked their ass over there

152
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,180
last march the Pentagon released some
figures on how many troops

153
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,249
have been fanned home for injury or
illness

154
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:14,160
20 19 thousand

155
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,189
and this is not people just got grazed
by a stray bullet the broke the skin

156
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,339
or got the sniffles or something

157
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,579
these are people who've had their arms
though their legs blown

158
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:32,550
of the capital kinda protect you from
bullets but not roadside bombs

159
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,120
when there's no armored put on the
Harveys in the first place that they had

160
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,579
a

161
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,860
save money for B-two bombers and
everything instead

162
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,430
people who may never walk again because
they have spinal injuries

163
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,550
things like that the illness they're
talking about

164
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,920
in all likelihood is the latest mutation
up golf

165
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,279
War Syndrome in on what helps cause Gulf
War Syndrome

166
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,279
remember john ashcroft back in one of
his many

167
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,069
the sky is falling terrorists are going
to attack us all summer that never seems

168
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:07,079
to happen

169
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:11,439
he claimed that they were going to blow
up dirty bombs

170
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:14,849
many get a regular bomb coated with
radioactive material

171
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,360
blow it up in a crowded area like this
and kill thousands of people through

172
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,309
radiation poisoning

173
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:23,759
guess who's using dirty bombs right now

174
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,019
lar in Iraq

175
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,620
shells coated with depleted uranium

176
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,399
and sure they'll go through the Iron
River tank and blow it up from the

177
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,449
inside

178
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:38,690
when he got leftover radiation

179
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:44,560
n we left 40 tons of depleted uranium
behind in goal for one

180
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,250
which may explain why the cancer rate in
southern iraq then went up seven hundred

181
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,140
percent

182
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,330
we used in Costa voted 0

183
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,460
they cause the bars come on back we got
rid of los vecinos butchers

184
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:04,460
and see we left your land happily aglow
and yes we're using at this time

185
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,880
ya many people are now living on
disability

186
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,560
from the first gulf war in this country

187
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,810
230 sixth

188
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,640
thousand so if you know anybody who you
care about who's

189
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,830
in the military or thinking about
joining now might be a real good time to

190
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,850
do whatever it takes to talk come

191
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,300
Indian not joining or not going over
there

192
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,300
six-month

193
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,150
in the brain making it happen as bad as
living the rest of your life was

194
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,640
splitting headaches double vision got
the shakes all the time

195
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,130
your brain plays tricks on you can't
work anymore

196
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,430
kids being born with cancer and stuff
like that

197
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,850
there is a price our soldiers are paying
over there

198
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,410
of course the job USA PATRIOT Act

199
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:05,010
is still with us and run thirst kinda
laws get on the books

200
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,370
they seem to be really hard to get rid
of both

201
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,540
notice how up front John Carey

202
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,800
has has not been about repealing

203
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,820
the Patriot act and

204
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,430
summer you may recall the Total
Information Awareness

205
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:27,540
proposal Tay bringing Larry ellison's
wet dream to fruition where

206
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,650
they would try to hire a company called
ChoicePoint the same ones who helped

207
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,319
break the election in Florida

208
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,770
to try an interfaith all over the
private databases on everybody the

209
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,089
credit card companies in the insurance
companies

210
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:44,589
and the government have out of wine big
fire are the one big file

211
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:48,610
and know everything about you and

212
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,089
that idea got for torpedoed for now but
expect to see that again

213
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:59,180
ironically the one they wanted to put in
charge have it was john poindexter

214
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,530
who should still be in jail for his
culture gate crimes

215
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,900
ollie north right hand man in all the
drug running

216
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,580
assassinations in are terrorists called
the culture is killing thirty thousand

217
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,100
people in nicaragua

218
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,480
thought we bring him back and then I
guess there's been panels on this still

219
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,160
about uses and abuses love the smart
cards

220
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,360
there are already coming in in Europe
and one person who many people in this

221
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,950
room may think it's kind of a hip guy

222
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,980
proposed in March 2002

223
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,150
requiring all manufactures irv computers

224
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,240
to include ID card reader

225
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,320
so that in order to log on at all

226
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,260
you'd have to put your smart card A N
and then whatever you did

227
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,939
word all be known in recorded by the
people who issue the smart cards

228
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,200
he said in this talk quote privacy is
the new

229
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,670
urban myth guess who said that

230
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,870
Howard Dean yeah

231
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,790
yeah meanwhile our bodies ChoicePoint

232
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:19,949
also now sell at Walmart for $39 dollars
and 77th nth

233
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,080
a little spy in a box kit called
background check

234
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,810
which is software for you can tap into
ChoicePoint

235
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,020
online database an lookup

236
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,339
all the dirt on anybody you lot don't
have to wait for poindexter you can't do

237
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:36,660
it

238
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,189
yourself last june 4th

239
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:47,140
Robert Mueller the head of the FBI
proposed a new domestic spy agency with

240
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,080
in the FBI to function as a domestic CIA

241
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,829
restrictions 0 in other words basically
legalizing what they already do

242
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:01,870
illegally anyway another one

243
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,250
that supposed to come into effect this
month but I haven't heard her mother

244
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,620
actually has yet find doubting it

245
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,089
your caps two another one to bash cracks
little things i'm having everybody wants

246
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,449
to get on a plane

247
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:18,100
have to submit to all these background
checks such a course they can then I'll

248
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,230
give the choice point or whatever

249
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,540
and two side to side were denied your
even allowed to fly on a plane at all

250
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,209
green you're okay yellow an

251
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:31,939
air given the third degree at the
airport every single time

252
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:35,490
red you'll never get on a plane again

253
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,980
who might be red-flagged well not a real
efficient way to fight terrorists who

254
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,990
can forge ideas that will

255
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,459
anyway but while people who got red flag

256
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,800
but a year and a half ago was not
allowed to fly from any

257
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,369
airport in north carolina much to his
surprise

258
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:57,569
was Doug's steuber his crime

259
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:00,970
being head love the North Carolina Green
Party

260
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,779
and stupor reported that the homeland
security people even brought out a big

261
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:06,829
old notebook

262
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,408
have suspected terrorist organizations
and they're on the same page in

263
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:14,589
alphabetical order row Qaeda and Green
Party

264
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:20,408
year I mean that hasn't been used wisely
yet but given time

265
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:24,669
I mean with caps to even the information
is not that interesting to Liberty got

266
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,490
that anyway

267
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,740
it's the submission and acceptance love
being spied on

268
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:36,740
that interests them the most Digital
Millennium Copyright Act

269
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,230
is still with us you never heard carrier
Howard Dean even mentioning the

270
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,200
existence the bat let alone what should
be done with it

271
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,279
and on top of that are I don't know the
status other right today

272
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,179
but %uh senator y'all your friend and
mine senator orrin Hatch

273
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,750
noted recording artist have 16 CD albums
by the way

274
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,000
up why I'm scared to gas apparently
ashcroft made a religious album years

275
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,360
ago to do but I've never seen one in a
thrift store anything

276
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,860
and as crack also wrote his own
patriotic anthem after September 11th

277
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,640
we're so far I've only been able to get
thirty seconds love but

278
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,299
their ears on CNN went from the Justice
Department podium

279
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:31,720
/url who's really go les lord

280
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,590
and let the ego saw it was in a rare

281
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,908
not to affirmative action he called
latino higher-ups in the justice

282
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:42,659
department with office

283
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:47,690
and asked them to translated into
Spanish and has people sing it with them

284
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,840
before he begins

285
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,340
each day of work whether this is before
or after the Pentecostal prayers I don't

286
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,000
know

287
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,330
and as crack is so out there i mean he's
practically Taliban material as many be

288
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,370
probably know

289
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,820
covering up one big metal Tati statue
with the justice department the curtain

290
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,418
and everything if for some

291
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:13,929
you know ashcroft Ian pentecostal ritual

292
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,659
I mean he's from Springfield Missouri
right who only legalized high school

293
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,880
dance thing in the late eighties and
only under court order

294
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,919
anyway as crack

295
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,750
before he takes the oath of office he
covers himself and cooking oil

296
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,770
too bad nobody brings a matcher anything
but to

297
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,049
anyway

298
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:43,980
orrin Hatch is trying to get Senate to
fast track and quickly path

299
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,399
the inducing infringement of copyright

300
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:51,730
act outlawing even the construction or
possession

301
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,080
over any device that might be used to
infringe upon

302
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,730
corporate copyrighted material in other
words

303
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,770
CD burners illegal peer to peer networks

304
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,809
illegal iPods illegal

305
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:14,000
surely mister Wozniak in the others have
enough money they can fight theirs but

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,690
we shall see I mean some people say oh
yeah we can always circumvent that

307
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,010
around bad anyway will just create a
huge black market

308
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,230
kinda like drugs or job beer you had to
hide from

309
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,190
Elliott nah 30 machine-gun you on the
Untouchables and everything

310
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,850
but a black by occurred in order to
break an unjust law that hasn't really

311
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,480
gotten rid of the marijuana laws yet

312
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,789
has it so we don't wanna see the
Inducement Act path

313
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:47,370
and they're also trying to sneak it into
the free trade agreement at the Americas

314
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,539
you know what that is you know like
nafta on crack it extends all the worst

315
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:52,590
up for that

316
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,000
to the restive South and Central America
and the Caribbean

317
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,299
only cuba is exempt so we're doing a
castro a huge favor on this one

318
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,429
it basically says that corporations have
the same right

319
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:10,149
as sovereign nations that are equally
powerful and can go into any cut go to

320
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:12,220
the FTAA Commission

321
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,299
and try and wipe out any other countries
law that they say interferes with the

322
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:17,809
right to profit

323
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,020
and shake down the country no matter how
poor they are

324
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,080
for blood money for things like failure
to privatize schools

325
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,730
failure to hand over the electricity
grid failure to let Clear Channel

326
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,780
eat up all the radio stations failure to
let Rupert Murdoch is somebody worse

327
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:40,080
eat up all the newspapers etcetera and
the FTAA

328
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,799
is supposed to have the equivalent up
the induced act in there as well

329
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,549
and as the digital world takes over the
workplace it is

330
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:55,399
are constantly been abused and turned
into an electronic plantation

331
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,889
and now a new trendy term that come in
the last few months

332
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:04,500
of shoring it does the Grizz in a great
when stocks go up when a company

333
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,690
Offshore's which means of course

334
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,590
they take your job and ship it to India
or wherever

335
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,000
and many companies even require the
people they're about to fire

336
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,690
to train the new employees before
they're fired

337
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,129
an I'm glad to see since I came here
four years ago

338
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:28,520
there's been a growing interest in
respect for

339
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,408
hacktivism as opposed to just hacking
for up

340
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:40,409
recreation

341
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,600
one other big dangers we face in this

342
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,200
upcoming so-called election is
hacktivism from the other side

343
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,690
way worse than the hacktivism already
done by choice point

344
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,110
in Florida detailed in a book called the
best democracy money can buy

345
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,610
by Greg Palast where they purged all the
suppose it convicted felons meeting

346
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,879
those negro voters who might vote for
gore

347
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:13,620
of the voter rolls javan Katherine
Harris were both in on this

348
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,510
and then palestine actually locked at
the print outs and what not in the

349
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,649
database and what choice but was up to

350
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:24,990
May had all these people convicted of
you think convicted of a felony in 2004

351
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:28,370
convicted of a felony in 2007

352
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,139
and he claims the offer this information
to the gore campaign three weeks before

353
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:34,899
the regular election

354
00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:39,240
and they turned it down and even
afterwards when people were up in arms

355
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,149
over

356
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:44,000
10,000 the people not allowed to vote
because they were black and Florida

357
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,429
where was al gore 1 I've many ready
battler GIC to being photographed with

358
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,929
civil rights leaders have different skin
color

359
00:23:52,929 --> 00:23:57,990
what I mean they are for anybody who
says Nader Costco or the election will

360
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,129
there's one of many reasons gore cost
himself

361
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:08,129
that election when other people

362
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:13,500
other people involved in some heavy-duty
hacktivism trying to go national

363
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,690
with electronic voting which of course
is easily altered in really good

364
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,840
especially when there's no paper trail

365
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,889
is a company called d bold

366
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:26,200
out all HIO whose head

367
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,049
Wally o'dell even came right out and
said quote

368
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:34,658
I will deliver Ohio for George W Bush

369
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:40,779
gas how who may be the same thing that
happened in bloom City Indiana

370
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:44,840
way got one of these electronic voting
gizmos to be all modern

371
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,590
and sure enough amazing statistic that
reported

372
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,039
144,000 people voted

373
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,500
in a place that had only nineteen
thousand registered voters

374
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,580
and for anybody who post anything

375
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,109
questioning whether DeBolt machines work
properly

376
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:06,760
or are even intended to work properly

377
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,470
de Paul has been sending out fees nd 50
letters

378
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:15,100
to net service providers for publishing
any the internal documents

379
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:20,049
showing that their machines might screw
up once in a while

380
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,210
head to the FCC is Michael Powell

381
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,350
the baby doc Duvalier of the broadcast
world

382
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,090
only reason they got that job is because
he's colin powell's fat pasty doughboy

383
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,030
look and fun

384
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,750
and he is sad he is called the broadcast
industry

385
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,840
under monopolized and 30 called

386
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,409
has no idea what the public interest is
no wonder he was trying to ram through

387
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:53,760
lead more more laws getting real
important regulations about media

388
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,710
monopoly

389
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,090
to allow people I Clear Channel and
flocks

390
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:04,119
and Mickey Mouse to swallow up more and
more of the outlets we are exposed to

391
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,290
that most people believe the information
they get on it

392
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,139
and up you know don't really realize
what's going on all the local

393
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:13,899
programming community affairs programs

394
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:17,799
and talk shows anywhere to the left of
Michael Savage

395
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,129
are mysteriously removed from the
airwaves

396
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:26,240
you know that know that powell's par the
job those who rule information

397
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,940
and can control what have a much better
chance of controlling

398
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,059
the world and those other smaller waves
are systematically trying to shut off

399
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:37,320
our access to information

400
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:43,039
even in San Francisco now the day at
thirty six-year-old yuppie scum named

401
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,539
Gavin Newsom is the mayor who

402
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,658
grew up in the Getty mansion and his
whole platform was I hate homeless

403
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:51,500
people vote for me

404
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,669
he barely won by the way even those post
a win in a walk but hopefully I have

405
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:57,919
time to get to that later anyway

406
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,809
even though he did the right thing on
gay marriage after holding his finger to

407
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,080
the wind and saying mmm

408
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,740
which is more likely to make me
president later in decided he lowered

409
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,799
lose them overall has been poisonous you
know

410
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,389
Vic shins going way way up again and

411
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:19,730
also suddenly people are getting busted
and find huge amounts of money

412
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,320
for putting up fliers on telephone poles

413
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,600
or anywhere else and at the same time

414
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,330
the trying to get rid of newspaper
vending machines

415
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,970
and require them all to be put in the
special machines they call

416
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,820
head mounts built by the JCDecaux
company in France

417
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,720
where there's only thing made six slots
if that

418
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,250
and if you're the seventh paper on the
block people don't have access to you

419
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,230
anymore

420
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,230
and on the back at the pad mouse
billboard space

421
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,600
controlled by get to Clear Channel

422
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,450
handed to room for free another way

423
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,100
%uh restricting our access infertility
information

424
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,480
as the way love deliberately dumbing
down society

425
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,129
to create more people who will fall for
things like

426
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:14,510
there's and basically a Chris create a
society

427
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,960
of paranoid reactionary angry

428
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,869
homer heads who actually believe what
they thought the

429
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:25,399
on Fox News you know not just obedient

430
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:28,809
but militant lead stupid

431
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:35,809
shall we say

432
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:41,340
you know this is in capitalism anymore
with so-called free trade in

433
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,190
revolving door between corporations
pentagon other government positions

434
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:50,690
this is feudalism they think capitalism
this is fuel -ism

435
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,330
berendzen lords and I councils have
names like bowling

436
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:58,250
exxon Microsoft or a call

437
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,669
Warner Brothers mcdonnell's every time
we go out and give

438
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:07,599
any of them money for anything we owe
their service

439
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,789
little hard to escape that here
completely

440
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:16,940
it's getting to the point were
corporations not only get to write the

441
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,720
laws

442
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,549
and make the laws they get to enforce
them themselves to

443
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:27,049
not just through phony free trade
agreements but your friends in mind the

444
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:29,158
RIAA

445
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,590
Recording Industry Association of
America

446
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,789
becoming more and more their own
enforcement arm blurring the where

447
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:39,899
big business and then government begins

448
00:29:39,899 --> 00:29:42,909
according to the LA weekly their

449
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:47,059
anti-piracy unit the AP you

450
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:51,178
in los Angeles has been dressing up to
look like police

451
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,960
and terrorizing street-corner vendors in
Latino neighborhoods

452
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:02,649
seizing their desks and getting photo
ID's up them to get their file going

453
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:07,780
and you know I barely well I miss keep
their part for now but

454
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,530
up and the IAEA's well somehow they have
the right now

455
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,570
to sue thousands of people at random

456
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,520
for failure to buy enough of their
products

457
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,940
imagine if kellogg's got this power
something

458
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,210
to 12-year-old girl in the projects in
this town

459
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,289
salud for file sharing 71-year-old

460
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,950
Derwood pickle in Texas salud

461
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:40,690
for file sharing and now the normally
supposedly liberal John Conyers and

462
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,940
Howard Berman in congress

463
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,669
are proposing a bill the third if you
trade as much as one music file

464
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:52,169
it's a felony that lands you five years
in prison

465
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:55,760
and they justify that by saying well
each file is the theft of two hundred

466
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,039
and fifty dollars

467
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:04,809
right Australia two guys have already
gotten 18-month jail terms

468
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:08,970
for file sharing they were both
suspended this time to make an example

469
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,809
out of them but

470
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:14,549
that doesn't make me feel too
comfortable either all this in spite of

471
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:18,299
a new study from people at Harvard
University of North Carolina

472
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:23,609
who tracks 680 albums over seventeen
weeks in late 2002

473
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:26,960
and concluded their overall file-sharing

474
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,679
increases CD sales

475
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:35,109
for anything that was already sold over
600,000 copies

476
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:39,429
but up and there they said that they
made their model for how much file

477
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:41,470
sharing would really costly thing

478
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:46,020
and it's a tall of two million dollars
in lost sales

479
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:49,129
while the major labels are CD sales in
general

480
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:54,549
from 2000 to 2002 fell $139 million
units

481
00:31:54,549 --> 00:32:01,549
maybe because they put out too much crap
and because of the bush economy

482
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:10,080
and because of the bush economy people
don't have the kind a disposable income

483
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,629
they used to have

484
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:15,700
especially to buy an album with only one
good song

485
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,379
on it in a lot of love for whatever of
course %uh

486
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:23,309
under six staff hundred thousand copies
or in the case of my little label

487
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,619
generally under 6000

488
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:30,070
we have been hurt a lot more I was
hoping we would bounce back up again to

489
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,939
like we did with Napster

490
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,450
but that hasn't happened and it's
getting harder and harder

491
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,030
to sell a unknown band in breakup
thousand copies and break even on the

492
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,349
damn thang

493
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:46,470
some but not all that is because the
file sharing

494
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:52,429
so I ask again you know for the smaller
artist please support the people

495
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,399
who are basically a lot from paying out
other own pocket to make their dream

496
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,559
come true in

497
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,869
make a few copies of their album in if
they can't get rid of them they may not

498
00:33:00,869 --> 00:33:07,869
make another one

499
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:11,389
lot of the bands on Alternative
Tentacles the newer ones and we're all a

500
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,139
few labels left will take chances on
unknown bands that have

501
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:19,349
dig up an all-world punk rock band and
try and recycle it again and again and

502
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:20,039
again

503
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,309
I mean we put out some old stuff too but
I like to put out new stuff

504
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:26,510
and the band's break-up a lot quicker
than they used to

505
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:31,950
in part because they ain't got any money
to buy food or gas for the van and get

506
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,860
frustrated and all

507
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,840
and I'm not saying everybody should
automatically buy into the rock star

508
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,620
dreamin' we expect a swimming pool or a

509
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,990
free bus or something but the first time
I brought this up when I was first here

510
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:49,539
somebody later came up to being lectured
me that it was politically incorrect

511
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:55,269
for an artist to ever want any kind of
money for their work 'em any kind

512
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:58,889
I have were two word reply for that

513
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:05,889
rock you

514
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,179
it's weird that some of these people
feel that way are the same ones who say

515
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:10,790
that

516
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,830
labor's don't get paid enough

517
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:18,929
but we shouldn't get paid at all I mean
I'm not asking for showers have money

518
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:23,500
just to be able to pay the bill so I
don't wind up working at mcdonald's her

519
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,620
sea border whatever so I mean I that's
all I'm saying meanwhile

520
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,330
the major labels claim because the
Wallace we could file sharing

521
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,190
we're going to play ok work going broke

522
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,940
to which I can only quote a famous
flipper song and say

523
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,429
I of all

524
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,819
he well if you really think they're
going broke

525
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:52,929
take a look at any issue you care to
love Billboard magazine

526
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,529
the ones that the one you know this is
kinda thereby beloved pup

527
00:34:56,529 --> 00:35:01,549
sell sell sell sell sell everything
here's the Billboard Top 200

528
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:05,000
what we got top one and this week is
outcast

529
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,240
seven million copies sold they have a
third goal there for everything that's

530
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,580
gone goldenthal half-a-million

531
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,440
a triangle for everything that fall gone
platinum unfold over a million

532
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,060
lost everything in the top 200 has at
least a third column most may have

533
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,390
triangles

534
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,009
somebody the like 10 million copies sold

535
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:27,359
Norah Jones eight million copies sold

536
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,960
Eagles even now in a repackaging two
million copies sold

537
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,960
and for some weird reason 10 million
Americans bought a new rod stewart album

538
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,250
the point being they're not going

539
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,980
brown ok at all they're just a little
worried about cutting executives

540
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,069
make a million-dollar salaries or
something macon a hereof

541
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:57,160
that and how many you know that when the
major labels do swiped money through

542
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,040
suing a file share whatever

543
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,259
the artists don't give a damn thing

544
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:05,870
they're just pocketing in a way for
themselves

545
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:11,330
major labels recently had to settle with
several states for price-fixing

546
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:15,549
for somewhere around what was was a
thirty year fifty million bucks

547
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:19,009
rather than fight it they just agreed to
settle they knew they were ripping

548
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:20,569
everybody of

549
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:24,589
and then they settled again out of court
with some artists

550
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:27,740
for under deliberately underpaying their
royalties

551
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,410
again to the tune of about thirty
million dollars

552
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,720
the excuse being we lost their addresses

553
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,540
the addresses of Dolly Parton the
addresses

554
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,980
up puffy combs to

555
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,069
he weirds me out

556
00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:50,410
now why would anybody

557
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,060
take the time for press releases in
arranging everything

558
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,310
to change their name in mid-career from

559
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:02,000
hot daddy to he DD

560
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,650
can somebody please explain this to me

561
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:12,359
I mean is a diaper fetishist cold thing
for peeing in your DD they have no idea

562
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:17,869
major labels are also demanding that
online radio broadcasters encrypt their

563
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:18,930
broadcast

564
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,930
so nobody can record stuff off the radio

565
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:27,609
was they've been trying to find a way to
do for forty or fifty years and failed

566
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:30,640
but this also restricts access to
information

567
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,650
because you can't record documentaries
our news programs or anything

568
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:41,089
anymore that way either these are the
same people who in 1984

569
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:44,220
sealed Sony to block the Thales

570
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,190
a VCR machines the same lines

571
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,500
who went all the way to the Supreme
Court in 1908

572
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,250
to ban player piano rolls cuz they
thought it was

573
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:00,490
infringing on their copyrights maybe
they tried to stop the phonograph record

574
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:02,980
in the nineteenth century cuz it might
interfere with

575
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,410
fails and sheet music and like ash crack

576
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,180
these the same people who say they want
to get government off our backs

577
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,589
leather corset interferes with money
they wanna make

578
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:18,770
and speeding up getting government off
our backs %uh

579
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,970
anybody planning to go to the Republican
National Convention

580
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,160
the

581
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,810
that's gonna be an interesting one isn't
dead I mean

582
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:34,220
you that some people are hoping for a
million people in the streets

583
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:41,220
just saying that this to the bush
administration everything they stand for

584
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:50,500
you thankful the Phillies would learn by
now am am coming to town Marilyn Manson

585
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,799
gland and big

586
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:55,250
no a problem bush comes to town

587
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,549
call out every reserve cop from a
500-mile radius

588
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:03,680
those going to be trouble with the fans
in all

589
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,740
I N the biggest danger

590
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:11,259
I think aside from incredible police
violence

591
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:16,770
is making sure her that the word gets
out that it even happened

592
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:20,410
making sure her the word gets out

593
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:26,290
to people who normally would only be
watch CNN or Fox R&B 30

594
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,960
that there were this many people protest
thing in the first place

595
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,359
because the other sides in Seattle's got
a little smarter to

596
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:40,319
haven't they how many view even know the
year so to your nap after Seattle

597
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:43,690
an even bigger group 70,000 people

598
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:50,690
swarmed on the free trader the Americas
conference in Quebec City in Canada

599
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:57,440
but ask almost anybody random you know
thing ever heard that happen most people

600
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,759
will say no

601
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:03,119
let alone that one of the great Bush
quotes happened during Matt till

602
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,400
nah nah nah nah coming a press
conference today not an English

603
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,410
mad branch not a Mexican

604
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,009
yeah another thing they do now

605
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:18,119
years arrest the protest leaders

606
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:21,319
ahead of time no matter what they've
done

607
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:26,220
Washington DC before 10 the actions
against the world bank and

608
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,310
International Monetary Fund meetings
they arrested a buncha people for the

609
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,790
crime of puppet making

610
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:36,380
in Seattle they arrested people for
possession have gas masks

611
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,630
knowing full well if they ever try
brought that to court

612
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,839
it would be thrown out but by the time
it went to court

613
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:47,040
the protests would already have passed
on they do this again and again and

614
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,150
again

615
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,210
and my guess is they're not going to be
very nice or civil

616
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,509
this time the NYPD's reputation is

617
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:59,460
the not as likely to fuck with you as
they are in LA or Philly

618
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,819
but when they do they really do a good
job

619
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:09,819
other it just ask Obama doody ya lower
abner louima are any of them

620
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:17,080
one other more of a this story of course
being

621
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,690
if you do go to the protests are
planning to go what might be were

622
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,509
scouring the thrift stores now

623
00:41:23,509 --> 00:41:27,310
for old sports equipment like football
helmets

624
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,359
hockey helmets bike helmets shoulder
pads

625
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,640
what have you you may wind up needing
them the Japanese learn this clear back

626
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,118
in the sixties I noticed

627
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,279
the footage a protesters there cops wore
helmets they wore helmets

628
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:45,549
cops got but I'm they got but odds cops
got shields

629
00:41:45,549 --> 00:41:52,549
they got shields

630
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:58,430
and a chorus nothing there's nothing the
cops and the corporate media like

631
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:03,770
more then if somebody breaks a window at
Starbucks or something

632
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:07,640
and they can quickly call it a anarchist
riot

633
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,049
on the news and ignore all the labor
union people who showed up and

634
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:12,989
everything else

635
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:17,470
plus 10 the cuts they are riot let's
have our police right now and beat the

636
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,369
crap outta

637
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:23,759
everybody so if you do see somebody
they're getting ready to do something

638
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:25,190
stupid

639
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,330
you know put your arms around them lock
'em whatever stop um

640
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:36,330
basically

641
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,700
what easier way to disguise an
undercover cop than the poll a black

642
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,690
book lava

643
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,200
over their head and have them claim
their part of the Black Bloc

644
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,309
were there was a little weird in general
I the big protest at the g8 summit there

645
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:55,910
a few years ago the most violent ones to
date

646
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,368
the black their reports coming in
through Indymedia

647
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:04,309
with the Black Bloc people were not only
theme conversing with the cops

648
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:05,349
repeatedly

649
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,200
but were never ever beat-up or arrested

650
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,700
what does that tell you you know I'm not
saying that all black bloc people may be

651
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,829
undercover cops

652
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:20,299
anymore than every single member of the
weather underground was undercover cops

653
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:23,980
just possibly a significant a number

654
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,930
'em size of them to screw things up for
everybody else

655
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:33,598
unless we stop 'em and all so the main
point is to get the word out

656
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,210
about the protests and why people are
really there that it's not just an

657
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,520
anarchist riot but the reason we're
really there

658
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,270
is because nobody has shown more
disrespect

659
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:51,579
and been more exploitive towards the
innocent victims of Sept 11th

660
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:58,579
than the Bush administration themselves
her feel more secure now that we're

661
00:44:04,299 --> 00:44:05,849
occupying Iraq

662
00:44:05,849 --> 00:44:09,630
I N statistically

663
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,799
both terrorist attacks and al Qaeda
attacks

664
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:16,900
have gone way up since we went into
Afghanistan

665
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,910
that's how effective this is working so
with all this

666
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,930
trumpeting complete with live usual
corporate logos on CNN and the other

667
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:24,808
news outlets

668
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:30,589
handover on june thirtieth the iraqis
have their sovereignty back now

669
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:34,839
surveyed downloaded we took out

670
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,020
the Emperor we install the guy who used
to work for henry kissinger was a

671
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,859
privatization specialist

672
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:46,049
name paul Bremer took him out he got on
the plane June 30th

673
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:50,109
to fly home to New Hampshire to have
course right occasion book

674
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:54,130
and get back to what the corporate media
said was his real passion in life

675
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:58,549
teaching gourmet cooking classes I am
touched

676
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:02,259
but meanwhile the provisional government
now

677
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:07,369
they must run everything goal all I
wanna pass by

678
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:11,720
American generals who have veto power
over anything they do

679
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:17,329
and the US military and any foreign
private contractors including

680
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:18,720
mercenaries

681
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,500
which they call security are completely
exempt

682
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,020
from all iraqi laws that is not

683
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:33,589
sovereignty and you know did I say this
earlier than I did not this time anyway

684
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:37,839
you know we've killed twenty thousand
I'm already were occupying their country

685
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:42,910
killed millions possibly before that
even if we wind up killing often

686
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:46,578
squelching every single person who ever
supported saddam hussein

687
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:50,299
every Muslim all over the world is down
with Osama bin Laden

688
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:53,940
what will their kids be like

689
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,990
look

690
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,130
know your further then and now

691
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:08,450
%ah the Houla young those little boys
are throwing rocks at israeli soldiers

692
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:13,240
suicide bombings and bombing starting to
happen even in Madrid

693
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,650
in Turkey Morocco Bali even their

694
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,690
is your anther and another thing that
doesn't ever seem to get into corporate

695
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,490
news

696
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:28,490
years guess what George W Bush did she
Nikon to flee the rise Tony Blair

697
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,319
Paul Wolfowitz john ashcroft Karl Rove
jeb bush

698
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,990
bill clinton rush limbaugh newt Gingrich
Bill O'Reilly

699
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,539
House Speaker Dennis Hastert house
dictator Tom DeLay

700
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:43,529
arnold schwarzenegger and Rambo Stallone

701
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:48,400
all have in common they've all been be
delivered two babies for months and

702
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,230
months before we went and

703
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,270
to Avenue bloodbath in the Middle East
Iraq

704
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:56,930
and not a damn one of them has ever
served in the military

705
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:01,640
not while I'm

706
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,308
this whole real is being run by chicken
hawks

707
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:10,950
damned if they're gonna send their own
kids to fight in Iraq

708
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,390
ironically the one who came the closest
was the

709
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:19,450
George W Bush because 30 he supposedly
showed up

710
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,829
for national guard duty here and there
now the thing I will all the records are

711
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:24,140
lost

712
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,200
interesting former activism if you will

713
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,730
and now they can't find the 100 to 500
times the weapons of mass destruction

714
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:38,089
they knew saddam had with a well as okay
to go in an Occupy iraq

715
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:42,359
anyway in the first preemptive war in
our history

716
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:47,038
now at our plant report we have to
attack them just case a tack last Sunday

717
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,599
the same logic Hitler used for invading
Austria

718
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:57,599
poland czechoslovakia France and the
rest fame playing

719
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,299
well it's okay because look liberated
iraq

720
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:08,970
you know out at the saddam frying pan
into the Halliburton oil well fires Yap

721
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:13,759
well if that we will if win a bidder the
S saddam was a bad mother fucker

722
00:48:13,759 --> 00:48:19,509
but does that mean that we now say that
it's OK for Canada and Europe in mexico

723
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:26,509
to invade this country to liberate us
from bush

724
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,370
we may need that
