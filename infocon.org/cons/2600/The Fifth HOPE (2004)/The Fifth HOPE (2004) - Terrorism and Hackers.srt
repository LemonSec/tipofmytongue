1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:03,299
so I this is me

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,540
my name's Greg maybe that is my name arm
I see a left off a i

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,280
right hand close friend sees a resume
our

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,340
this means by talk will not compile

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,520
any elkind there's

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,710
so I

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,780
this is like the story of the other
covers child that has no shoes Devin

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,289
Devin

9
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,320
I introducing great talks today actually
have tomorrow's talk that I'm doing with

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,140
pork chop really well planned out

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,600
I this stock get a lot lot of thought
because it's

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,699
its I think I deep talk in some ways
early sir

13
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:43,170
raises a couple things that I

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,780
you might have thoughts about arm and I

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,789
when I went to actually try to peron
love you HTML slides

16
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:57,569
and I'll I got tangled up a little bit

17
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,440
like one is moral things we say thank
you know you want to say and then we

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,468
start saying is a lie

19
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,280
now so hear dis so it will here's what I
want to deal with this talk

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,700
and we're or Friday evening ten o'clock
many have you been here

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,960
I you know all day some folks are coming
in you can be here for the overnight

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,719
stuff like that

23
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:18,409
on what I want you to do is

24
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:21,820
on try to think and unstructured mana

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,810
not to not bring too many

26
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,259
assumptions with you here I I don't like
the word terrorism at all in fact

27
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,810
usually when I start doing well as radio
stories

28
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,850
you know that word comes up shut off you
know it's

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,289
pain in the butt not nada

30
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:46,240
not a word that really describes
anything in a useful way arm

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,259
a word that describes things in a very
pretty or dove way

32
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,399
that really might be a little more
ambiguous

33
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,429
maybe even a little less on subject to
scorn

34
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:05,679
on further further reflection but when i
was thinkin what I want to talk about

35
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:07,600
what I want to propose for our

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,990
for this conference this was really
without first topic that

37
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,240
that came to mind and the reason is that
for the last year's end and our

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,580
a few people I'm sure i've seen these
talks not actually here

39
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,850
think in this room actually at you on
the DVD's and

40
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,750
has some webpages and stuff like that
previn talking about hacker ethic psych

41
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,420
background checks at age 2 K

42
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,830
I did something similar al 2001 I

43
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,650
talked about doing a curriculum for
ethics instruction

44
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,960
at h2k teal and so I've been thinking
about this for a while

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,460
and and somehow or other I thought that
that

46
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,860
are we had to put the word terrorism and
hacker

47
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,770
together and talk about what that really
means and and what their what the

48
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,220
result of these types of labels

49
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,300
are because these labels refer sometimes
break complex topics

50
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,220
and label hackers one that we've all had
problems with right don't like the way

51
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,630
that that labels use

52
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,870
lifetimes and I so this is where I i

53
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,600
I caught some thats energy and want to
talk about it so that's a

54
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,630
sorta sort of an overview I was over now
line

55
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,680
actually is realized I nothing at my
house hyperlinks working on this

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,850
up love love is my webpages petascale
.org

57
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,250
or the next couple days and I feel free
to drop in the mail

58
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,280
just side new bf has killed or other GV
newbie either is fine

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,720
actually think I was anything has killed
her cuz to me arm

60
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,950
is what I want to do

61
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,200
I want to %ah I wanna to do extremes

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,780
than welcome back to the middle and %uh
then we have some fun afterwards I was

63
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,200
going to show you some the recruiting

64
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,030
for basically recruiting for hackers
that's our happening now in places like

65
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,960
the NSA

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,440
the US Army assessor for finals as an
afterthought but what I want to do is

67
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,880
paint a picture I love

68
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,570
arm where hackers and terrorists out
something in common where they don't

69
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,700
have something in common

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,209
and where the sort of moral ambiguity
between values and actions

71
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,120
can can sort of cash us because I've
talked and and and 20 kinda magazine

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,910
place like that

73
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,440
we have Keiron idea about what hacker
ethics

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,920
are what values Thacker should be
released 10

75
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,160
would like to hold up and say no hackers
are that their

76
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,190
you know they're really curious and
talented them

77
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,230
and maybe not to I not

78
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,100
the ties that people I follow the rules
all the time no questioning authority

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,010
have these

80
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,599
you know things i would like to make

81
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,170
arm so we have values and we have
actions

82
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,250
Ryan action sometimes have consequences
I want talk a little bit I've middle

83
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,190
ground and out and do so with the
conclusion

84
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,660
make life easy and they are a conclusion
a week and work towards a I kind

85
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,450
introduction

86
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,000
if you closing thoughts and I'm a I'm
easy if you are

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,139
if you want to engage then it's actually
the lights are bright enough to cam not

88
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,040
necessarily gonna see if you raise your
hand

89
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,060
but you want to I say something

90
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,860
then now I talk stand-up come forward
more

91
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,980
yelping that you're helping on the
microphone held to bring the mic to you

92
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,090
I that's Kadam I'm being interrupted me
that's one thing with the conclusion

93
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,220
right rather than the fun stuff alright
so here's something that we probably all

94
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,270
agree with right

95
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,120
I hackers and terrorists it's not a
cinema and I think that is a real

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,050
problem

97
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,950
a you are a real problem that

98
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,180
the word hacker is used I in the same
sentence sometimes

99
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,500
with with terrorists our I in

100
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,790
in places may not seem Senate's but
things like that they're

101
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,940
Patriot Act and further enhancements the
United States Code

102
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,030
where I essentially anything that

103
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:04,910
a very short while ago you notice a a
few revisions that law bitterly

104
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,780
certainly within ten or twenty years ago
would have been not a big deal

105
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,970
you know so so prank like activities

106
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,530
on I you know very saves a break in the
systems and so forth

107
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,460
well things like Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act it had a bite

108
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,888
that's been around for for quite a while
by the arm

109
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,370
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has this
escalation

110
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,010
rise be fraud abuse act 1986 as X
escalation

111
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,820
where it's just break into a system well

112
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,099
there's not a ton a penalty for that
right depends

113
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,330
recidivism all these types of things
armed but a relatively low level

114
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,099
if you break into something like a
federal system our government system

115
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,310
a military system a bank system all the
Sun

116
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,940
they skyrocket you break into a system
in between there is going to be like

117
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,690
your corporate system for profit you
know serve you doing whatever

118
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,340
us realize denied if you're reselling
various types of things

119
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,610
are making making our sons are living
some sort of money a potentially some

120
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,280
sorry my

121
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,600
then you know again it's that sorta
raise

122
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,360
maybe this makes some type can send so
there's something to be said for the

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,850
punishment fit the crime

124
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,370
are but that sort of sense to the tender
was sense as falling by the wayside

125
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,790
and now all the sudden the I you know
the mir active

126
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,600
self-testing sometimes more active
penetration as a pretty severe

127
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,900
legal consequences so hackers on terrace

128
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,690
on and and I don't accept an answer most
people here don't accept

129
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,719
I you know sometimes I get tired of
correcting any

130
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,050
maybe don't always crack as much as we
should that the

131
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,620
the definition a Packers criminal

132
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,350
is is not accepted because as I said
before you have activities

133
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,810
and you have consequences ya values
right so an activity

134
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,639
arm I L port scan something like that

135
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,040
is I not the same as an activity like

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,690
after like fried we have very good ways
have

137
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,930
mentions a very good relations a pretty
well established ways labeling and

138
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,780
punching in judging and so forth

139
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,380
various types of of crime

140
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,590
and we have good labels for those right
you know we have

141
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,449
someone who commits fraud you know
felons over their burger labels for

142
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,060
criminals

143
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,060
we don't need the attackers label for
%ah

144
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,360
a criminal or send them on

145
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,900
I actually meant to grab the book I made
a note to myself that I didn't grab the

146
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,880
book

147
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,568
how many people here a CISSP certified
or %ah something similar

148
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:38,789
that many people so people know what it
is right arm

149
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,299
I there's a couple a difference urs %uh
security certs actually like a

150
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,029
security plus certification about things
are some study am doing the CISSP class

151
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:51,279
next week coincidentally after the I

152
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,930
weekend spent at the the hackers
conference

153
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,759
and they have this form I think I have
the for my laptop it on our truck pulled

154

174
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,360
registered I'd paid

175
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,540
my cut my job baby like four thousand
dollars already

176
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,219

application form

178
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:19,100
and I'm and I'm thinking wow you know so

179
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,759
what I said okay wait a minute if I have
to write this letter explanation what I

180
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,519
better do

181
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,889
is is make sure that we're talking about
the same thing because I wanna have to

182
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,240
write a letter that says you rely
heavily stocked on

183
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,179
hacker ethic site go on their work with
2600 that's really engaged in an hour

184
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:38,869
I know education for young people and
and you really at the forefront

185
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:42,199
I love followed out bye bye I believe
turning people away

186
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:45,519
from what might be a darker path leaning
towards some %uh those

187
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,800
real criminal herds that I mentioned
before

188
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,410
arm and I was you know running on my
mind with with alexander

189
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,850
but then I when I looked up hacker in
the index I've the CISSP training males

190
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,610
like this

191
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,119
1200 page hardcover book

192
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,679
lie to review questions stuff like that

193
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,350
their definition I don't have a ride
from me now but their definitions like

194
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,980
on page 75

195
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,920
was essentially armed hackers a criminal
breaks in your system

196
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,349
okay and it's all okay so I checked mail

197
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,709
has I center then I think it take the
exam next Saturday

198
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:27,139
wish me luck arm so

199
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:30,629
he has said it so that so this I mean
this is right there you don't black and

200
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:31,069
white

201
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:34,209
that that if you wanna be aces security
certified

202
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:38,240
professional are 10 things among the
many many many things they have to

203
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,379
memorize

204
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,019
I and I be able to recite are that

205
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,040
hacker equals criminal now I was not so
happy with that

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,139
on they didn't have packed riegle's
terrorists but they have to revise the

207
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,449
study guide

208
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,920
all that recently so so the hi you know
the

209
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,509
a hacker is a terrorist the breaks into
your system you see the effective

210
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,300
language there

211
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,800
arm and I and we know of course no use
denying that that hackers can do

212
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,860
I engage in activities that there might
be good they might be evil or bad or

213
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,179
questionable or

214
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,959
reprehensible and so forth on and might
my proposition always has been

215
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,360
maybe because I hang hang around at
conferences like this and talk to people

216
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,679
and see what they do and see the
speakers interact with

217
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,980
with all kinds folks that good far
outweighs

218
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,239
evil on or Charlene surly II the whole
lot of stuff that doesn't have a whole

219
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:32,689
lot value associated with that you know
port scans at greater evil

220
00:12:32,689 --> 00:12:36,329
I mean out these evil but Tom

221
00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:39,509
are but i i just have a belief that
there's there's a lot more good

222
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,649
going on and party that night talked
about this a few years ago and I

223
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:47,399
h2k is our people right and so we have
the whole range

224
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,529
you know short and tall in different
colors and different backgrounds and

225
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:50,959
different

226
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,239
you know everything you know different
religious police all I can stop

227
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:58,529
arm and so for people well I believe
that people on the whole

228
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,679
are more good than evil so statistically
speaking

229
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,709
so are we so that's my conclusion on

230
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,529
to to say that justice yes it was a mess
hackers on terrorists you know we don't

231
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,189
accept that

232
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:16,399
that definition arm I'm not gonna try to
find terrorists I they sound like the

233
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:16,929
word but

234
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:20,949
job but I think we all have kind ever
own definition and probably most

235
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:24,259
a bus would agree that the usage

236
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,730
%uh the word terraces is overly broad
arm

237
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,649
and essentially terraces terraces a %ah

238
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:37,829
I negative term and the definition i i'd
take a look ahead and paste and my

239
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:41,290
talker took a look in now
merriam-webster and the definition is

240
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,209
essentially

241
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,439
arm are were like aks

242
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,248
I don't think this is that doesn't
actually say were like in the index

243
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:48,799
Terry

244
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,519
essentially were like aks you know so
destroying property

245
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,929
murder mayhem stuff like that on engaged
in by nine state

246
00:13:56,929 --> 00:14:00,429
entities or non-government entities okay

247
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,540
so so really the distinction there is
not

248
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,540
the act right is not whether you're
shooting someone blowing something up by

249
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,019
you know the all the sides are things we
can think of

250
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,499
others whether or not you're doing it as
part of a state-sponsored

251
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:18,279
activity as part of the military is part
of a

252
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,939
you know congress all that's making
decisions all all it's our thing

253
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:25,069
answer right away we see that what I
mentioned earlier

254
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,769
that the action is the action right men
have that's where the definition and and

255
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,089
the label and stuff like that

256
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,290
so unhappy a blowing something up
whatever that action might be

257
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,079
I to break into some sources somewhere
that action maybe are labeling at one

258
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,309
where the other

259
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:44,699
as even ally was a the extreme even is
as good or evil

260
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:48,910
by surly labeling that is I say
terrorism verses

261
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,899
defense might might be at a separate
decision

262
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:58,759
from the action itself so I at the
extreme

263
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:03,149
we might say that that attackers are
terrorists might equate that and I've

264
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:07,089
I've heard and you heard our you news
reports and things like that where that

265
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:07,929
equation is

266
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,949
is currently implicit maybe not too
explicit sometimes

267
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:15,249
solicit that's really implicit arm

268
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:18,369
and I the other side this is this is
part of what got me started on this has

269
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:21,699
really happy I chatted with Robert see a
little bit and and and listen to his

270
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:22,879
presentation

271
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,480
earlier today seems like seems like it
should be saying yesterday earlier this

272
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,549
week but is actually about 12 hours ago

273
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:31,829
on yes this idea for national security

274
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:35,970
our college typeof program and us the
other

275
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,459
sir the other end of the spectrum is hey
if we don't have hackers were lose

276
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,139
right we gotta have these hackers
otherwise II you know someone else is

277
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:46,869
going to hack and our systems don't have
people that if and won't be able to

278
00:15:46,869 --> 00:15:47,910
defend ourselves as

279
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,368
in a cyberwar against cyber terror or
something like that

280
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,779
arm okay neither is both a little you
know

281
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,910
as I said at the out at the far end have

282
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,379
other extremes

283
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,799
are so we have feelings about the word
hacker of course and we have feelings

284
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,829
about the word

285
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:12,420
terrorism and I I'll neither these makes
me feel all that good

286
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,949
guys really I'm not denied you willing
to the actors are criminals and Allen

287
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:17,290
say that to

288
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,488
hackers are terrace that just doesn't
make a lot of sense to me

289
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:25,420
arm I'm a little more country or the
second proposition actually that's

290
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,290
that's

291
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:32,959
not that far from white dial rubber seal
saying this morning the idea that

292
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,239
did some problems especially the idea
that I

293
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,629
getting people into a situation young
people probably

294
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:43,619
but by people with talent into a
situation where the talent can be honed

295
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,359
for the uses of the state

296
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:48,569
in various types of activities

297
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,579
defensive offensive I Karen tell it's
all I

298
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,079
all at stuff that to all those

299
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,359
organizations do there may be a certain
residents but there's a problem we'll

300
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,699
get to that problem in a moment you
already know what it is cuz that's wise

301
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:03,209
tickling your brain

302
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:10,209
okay probably its tickling your brain
the same way I did mine

303
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,849
so I will do will do the the side that
that tickles little bit less

304
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,198
arm first so %uh so hacker terrace right

305
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,230
well so I hey I think I

306
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,380
this may be why things in the

307
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,620
in the movie agency that Roger Moore
movie yet but I i read one of his

308
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,940
one of his books and his running on
about our are the bin Laden guy

309
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,440
now is on a dialysate dialysis machine
right so is talking about how

310
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,799
you know what sort of health care
together like the case that Afghanistan

311
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,730
and whatnot

312
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,779
and that got me thinking what %uh
entered after they get

313
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:47,059
right they like the direct PC division
they have two calls

314
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,840
call in the engineer every time when
they moved from cave to cave

315
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,459
you know so probably there's in in in
them in our vision

316
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,570
out by you know islamic fundamentalists
your typical

317
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,760
you know hopefully very inaccurate but
stereotypical

318
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,460
arm you out above terrorists

319
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,830
there got a lot to offer for your
average Thacker like to sit at home on

320
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,570
DSL

321
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,019
or faster right with a couple a nice
gaming systems couple

322
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:15,460
a big file server stuff like that right
where's the appeal ready and you're

323
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,159
going to go to a cave see you can you
can have

324
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:22,659
I you know are packet radio download
speeds

325
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:28,330
I do now I don't see much of an appeal
their on

326
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,139
the the axe that that are engaged in
other there is some role so if you want

327
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:33,710
to

328
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,720
if you want to take down a plane right
hijacked planes like that would help a

329
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,889
lot would be for example arm

330
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:44,100
I I in inside information on the airline

331
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,679
you know operations inside information
I'm the the TSA

332
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,730
operations are other arm

333
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,049
things that might help you in your
planning to me there is a role

334
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,309
right maybe the hacker could be the
person that that job then again not say

335
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:58,658
the hacker is always

336
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,950
per cent breaks and by the the

337
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,460
hacker might be the the type of person
that could

338
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,659
break in the system's grab the data that
could be used for

339
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:12,929
I feel that I've terrorism arm

340
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:18,190
and and yet you know it with again this
prototypical stereotypical not

341
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,000
necessarily all that accurate notion of

342
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,399
up with the terraces terrorists are

343
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:27,809
arm I kinda doubt that they're they're
they're doing a whole lotta

344
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:32,129
thought when I talked about couple years
ago media

345
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:36,460
at the core curriculum for %uh for
hacking right upright don't forget about

346
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,289
the ethics are probably not teaching a
whole lot of

347
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,590
you in computer science 101 in the

348
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,049
training camps that we hear about are
supposed to be careful

349
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:49,740
so I'm not I'm just not that bag
concerned about down

350
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,779
about the hackers terrorists %uh
scenario

351
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,840
and yes I say the bottom there's really
there's a potential they mentioned with

352
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,360
with

353
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,590
getting into secret data that's early
are online and certainly

354
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,980
on now systems that are vulnerable you
know all systems we heard Shire today

355
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,269
right now

356
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:09,700
I he talks about job I

357
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,090
basically associating values with
protection

358
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,178
and saying you know you can have I
complete protection

359
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,899
if you're willing to you know give up a
whole bunch of other stuff right take

360
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,529
your citizens of the network all

361
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,169
said decision my beautiful arm

362
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:29,679
but the but really there's some some
possibility

363
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,120
and just like we've heard a couple
couple example since the

364
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,200
I you know the big guy increase in
Anderson and terrorism

365
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,279
the passed an 11th attacks all that
stuff

366
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,250
arm we do here people that are

367
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,149
not that different than us young people
that are there are living in places like

368
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:48,460
buffalo and

369
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,669
Oregon stuff like that and going to our
schools and so forth that

370
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,610
there for a reason to turn around and
and I engage actively

371
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,330
in support actual you know sorry
unquestionable

372
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,139
I or not to question why anyway
definition wise

373
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:09,080
terrorist activities so happens can
happen could happen more

374
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,379
arm I if

375
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,809
I were you know planning these sites
have activity those really give some

376
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,259
thought to what

377
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:20,370
the dude with the computer could do in
addition to the dude with the

378
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,779
whatever gone sums or explosive sound
that's our thing

379
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:27,669
rights let's go let's jump to the other
and this is part that take a little more

380
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:28,429
for me

381
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:31,909
so on so the one end is is basically
that

382
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:36,389
that hackers equal terrorist somehow are
terrorists need hackers

383
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:41,740
or hackers arm you know it's like you
you are in those old movies we have like

384
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,940
one marijuana cigarette and then you'd
be

385
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,029
shooting heroin or you know LSD in going
all crazy awesome

386
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:51,600
right so it's like you you trial hacking
into your terrorist

387
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
else like the next thing kick take like
to pass

388
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,190
you know can sniff two packets right now
that said

389
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,570
arm alright so I so hacker hacker
warriors

390
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:07,360
I so it's so this is the idea that bad
we got to get these people into

391
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,929
are the army into the Defense
Intelligence Agency International

392
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,860
Security Agency and so forth

393
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,710
because if we don't the other guys again
when because they're hackers are going

394
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,029
to be better than ours

395
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:21,159
and our systems are can be tough enough
in our algorithms are gonna be tested

396
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:22,860
enough and

397
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,220
where I can be able to respond quickly
enough to

398
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,720
to a dire threat where really the only
option for a reason is to

399
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,769
would never break and someone system
tonight do it and I'll the service

400
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:36,980
attack on that sort of thing

401
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,220
so good hackers BC secret weapon against
terrorists well wait a minute

402
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,360
okay what's wrong with this statement
well we said in

403
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,159
definition wise if you accept my Alice
memory merriam-webster's

404
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,159
online free dictionary they have a
better definition

405
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,840
on the case I'd actually bite down on me
like a picture

406
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,918
but that was a terrorist didn't have a
state

407
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,380
right so they don't have a state to they
have a top-level domain

408
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,389
writing me know there are they like AOL
I do now I mean that's there there are

409
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:08,799
like using AOL

410
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,620
incentive whatever dot tell but Afghan
send out a a

411
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,889
was a dietary out okay that's a deal

412
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:20,730
does suck I can about that so some

413
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,960
I its okay that's so there's a little
bit of a mismatch there

414
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,340
but on the other hand an all-out al show
you some other things that that

415
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,610
the insa an army and so far they're
actually looking for

416
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,659
there and there is there is actually a
pretty good role because the the

417
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:37,169
I the stuff that Packers are good at

418
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:40,830
includes things like putting pic pieces
above puzzles together

419
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,360
right sifting through a whole lot of
information arm

420
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,100
looking whoa looking for our
similarities and seemingly disparate

421
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,539
are unrelated pieces information

422
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,620
right and that I'd what I just described
well I describe a hacker but also

423
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,240
described

424
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,320
a good intelligence analyst writer good
job

425
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,100
person to do single intelligence type
thing so are so there there is something

426
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,470
there

427
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,470
and again the tickling part if you
haven't figured out the lease was sickly

428
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,250
me or get into the sack

429
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,970
at the bottom here actually on so
national military school for %ah

430
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:19,820
for for what you might call the top gun
hackers are the obvious thing there's a

431
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,389
movie that did as I can remember

432
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:23,870
the name the movie that was where
there's a kid that played a video game

433
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,340
he got so good

434
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,139
they got recruited Starfighter thank you
I'm but remember that

435
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:32,509
as course on are hopefully everyone's
read Ender's Game

436
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:36,450
trilogy right where the little kid with
thought he was playing a video game

437
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,470
actually who is remote controlling all
these drones that one and winning

438
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,809
destroy the planet that was attacking
Earth of you haven't read it

439
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:47,899
required reading k sci-fi 101 Ender's
Game Ender's Game by Orson

440
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:52,059
Orson Scott Card yeah its first book in
a trilogy so I'm at this is you know I

441
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,480
can be able to finish by tomorrow
morning

442
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,700
arm but the part that trick that that
tickled me

443
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,759
because I I know some military people
arm

444
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,059
I haven't been one so it so don't speak
from from trends experience

445
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:09,190
but da what did I say before and I i

446
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,470
I had a hyperlink here I had to my that
hacker ethic soccer talked about in

447
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,990
mention some standard definition some
kind of the definition earlier

448
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,629
well hackers are not really all that
great authority lot of times it's one

449
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:23,799
that the characteristic stereotypical

450
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,529
you know with all the varieties some
people yes some people know

451
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,220
I've one's individual lots of a plot by
by large

452
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,440
right I hackers are all about
questioning

453
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,350
that authority about pushing the
envelope exploring the boundaries

454
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,220
on I you know looking when you see a
door looking around or look into the

455
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,730
door you know testing a drug that that's
our thing

456
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:49,279
arm does this sound like the ideal
candidate for I

457
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,330
you know for bootcamp a military service
and our

458
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,370
I you know sort of a very structured
environment they find

459
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,629
at least to me sir that military and

460
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:01,659
military-related places national
security

461
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:04,700
administration so forth doesn't sound
that

462
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,960
that consists in the me this is the part
that tickle right so if you want to be a

463
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,840
arm

464
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,019
I A for for whatever reason maybe you're
younger maybe a little older and say hey

465
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:16,019
I want to help my country only go out
and I i see these

466
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:19,710
job as gonna look at are to become an
intelligence analyst for the

467
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,370
our I I army intelligence

468
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,970
agency right well

469
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,450
how well as I can work when are you
can't

470
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,639
question authority as easily when the

471
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:39,049
the boundaries might be a lot tighter in
your %ah

472
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:42,279
your work environment computer
environment they are in your home

473
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,110
you're my man that's our thing so this
is the part that take a little bit for

474
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,669
me

475
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:49,759
that the you know the

476
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,250
the things that that make hackers
hackers early summer things make akers

477
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,139
hackers

478
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:58,870
are probably pretty opposite surly surly
not too consistent

479
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,340
with the things that make soldiers
soldiers things that make gone

480
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,440
warriors warriors again

481
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,720
think with ransall there was little
difference

482
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,420
so %uh to somewhere in the middle ground
is where we say that

483
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:21,750
is essentially we say that things are
are ambiguous and as I said earlier we

484
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,630
separate out the actions from the

485
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,950
from the values so I didn't mention one
or two

486
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,990
I weighs just of the car there are many
ways in which

487
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,040
hackers could use our efforts to support
terrorist activities

488
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,610
okay and you wouldn't even necessarily
be

489
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,170
terrorists are talking with terrorists
you necessarily have to go and visit

490
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:46,530
whoever those caves are wherever there's
training camps are things like that my

491
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,420
dude indirectly

492
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,310
right you might done you might get
information about

493
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,690
job I know you some inside information
about dad

494
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,550
wear them the next on Air Force one
plane

495
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,330
is a is going your presence trials line
says information

496
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,590
and I distribute that somehow I'll that
might help

497
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:10,570
terrace especially his or think about
where you can stripping get it where he

498
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,919
thinks whatever reason now

499
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,230
the real terrorists are are listening

500
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,780
Sony Vanessa this relapse bill that
active so we can think of

501
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:25,690
pay look at someone's a

502
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:30,690
okay when is why we have a ok I'm

503
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,220
amicus so we have a wired network for
the speakers magaziner

504
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:41,120
arm at the other at other and their many
ways which I

505
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,230
axe use our efforts to fight terrorism
tears activities

506
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,610
mean you mention a few surly just saw
the general area security Nazi

507
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,380
hackers equal security patrol is live
overlapping interests there

508
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,770
ice really the idea they're going to be
a I a penetration test things

509
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,830
charity hardening evaluating I

510
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,179
coda procedures for our weaknesses
that's our thing

511
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,730
well you know these are things that
could make got I would ever even see

512
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,160
whatever system more resilient

513
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,480
to terrorist attacks and as we'll see
arm

514
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,640
those are the mainstream activities
we'll see in some these job that's

515
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,740
another possibility

516
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,740
is to expand so incentive I

517
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,020
you know pursuing an interest in phnom

518
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,310
I security generally maybe you would go
and get involved in production

519
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,440
the car or %ah cryptanalysis a question
comment

520
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,770
yeah grab the mike is running at the
question on the arm on the tape

521
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:40,540
okay keep talking they'll turn up

522
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,850
okay a it seems me those propositions
can be

523
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,890
equally applied to any formal weaponry
from a .22-caliber handguns when the

524
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:49,890
time Obama

525
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,840
are you equating hacker with weaponry
well

526
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,390
I okay guidance implies there's no I'm
not die I'm almost not making any

527
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:01,320
argument here taller than the fact that
hackers on terrorists but there are

528
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,899
things that hackers could do that would
both

529
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,950
present and prevent in and help terrace
i think thats those are about the only

530
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,420
absolute same in some

531
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,290
bar I'm I'm looking at today but in
terms of bomb

532
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:16,960
are are taking something which you know
the kids are the gun is he okay I could

533
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,890
defend myself

534
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,580
likely going till somebody writer I can
go into something that that

535
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,699
die know people have different views I'm
go hunting go target shooting something

536
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,190
like that

537
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,410
of my point the I think probably our
price: analogy

538
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,600
for what I'm saying arm your hand and
not abusing

539
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
that is a it just because that

540
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,320
it's like terrorism right talk about gun
control on people's are thinking and

541
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,919
talking about different things that was
really want to go

542
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,300
i think is a good analogy arm

543
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,570
so are the efforts that like I said
whatever you know I'd die trying to

544
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,179
figure out how to do a denial of service
attack to

545
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,990
to prevent the system other than than
imminent danger

546
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,280
you know that whatever I'm it's hard to
match without actually be

547
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,250
by you know they've to prevent the
system has involved some sort but sorta

548
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:03,850
imminent

549
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,140
danger from operating effectively right
well

550
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,240
that could what I what I said could be

551
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,190
portrayed as a activity is someone who
would be

552
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,730
helping terrence Cody were some that
would be back could do

553
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,080
so the act the action doesn't
necessarily imply the on the route

554
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,800
good or evil arm says moral I ambiguity

555
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,300
because it s and I so

556
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,140
I I think it's it's not something that I
would want to argue

557
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,380
to say that for saying that to that

558
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,920
some hackers are criminals but hackers
on equal the criminals arm

559
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm not gonna I go someplace I'm not
going to make an argument that

560
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,340
that that some terrorists are evil

561
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,660
and some terrorists are just terrorist
town I'm not quite sure what the

562
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,030
I accept your sentence but I'm not quite
sure what the

563
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,970
I'll difficulty issue I think terrorism
is a

564
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,440
are terrorists is a pretty good label
use over broadly

565
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,940
but certainly the com the idea to say
that that is

566
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,010
its people that are better you know
doing things that

567
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:16,160
we would much more likely agree are evil
on

568
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,170
person different situation would say
they will hackers are doing stuff that

569
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,210
maybe the real maybe a good me there
there

570
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,830
I am bill on time the US arm

571
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,560
I would happen to the sentence

572
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,370
and parsing

573
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:40,370
that that that dog prince is messed me
up

574
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,730
fun couple like a a two-sentence I mean
a two-word I think you're

575
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:58,530
so on so we wanna

576
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:02,149
think that as hackers mosser what we do

577
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,049
is harmless and that if we choose to do
something which is harmful we choose to

578
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:06,570
do so

579
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,020
I was ok and it crashed Bob's computer
castle

580
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,299
on so it's so we know you know we have
we we walk in with eyes open

581
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,950
about about the where good and evil

582
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,970
appropriateness or inappropriateness as
a man talk about my previous talks

583
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,730
the idea the desire here's be thoughtful

584
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,940
and reflective right and for being
thoughtful reflective

585
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,799
arm then then you're leaning for the
Ethical site if you're being

586
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,490
thoughtless and not reflective

587
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,530
then then you're not being at the
gallery mike Beebe

588
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,350
caving and ethical fashion but the moral
processes

589
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,760
electoral process behind us are
consistent with that what I would call

590
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,289
behavior and again sever discussion
because I know

591
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:56,480
ethics is a top

592
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,480
like different things me said about arm

593
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,510
so if you're doing arm oh I don't know

594
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,280
so you're you're I you're helping them
and you know you're working for the

595
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,010
army intelligence looking at data that
came from

596
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,520
I are you looking at a human
intelligence came from spies and

597
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,159
interrogation stuff like that well you
might not feel that the

598
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,770
the activity is

599
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,900
that and that was gay that happened to
get the data

600
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,360
is consistent with moral behavior
incidences with ethical

601
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:42,360
behavior

602
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,739
much for the permit sensible go on okay
cause we'll need to do is get to the

603
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,450
introduction

604
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:51,649
are we did that losing earlier on

605
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:56,080
by dementia I put CISSP in

606
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,860
and the slide their so on so terrorism
is kinda catch-all phrase we know this

607
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,480
is a is a %ah problem

608
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,670
we also know that we arm copper tray
things at a few years ago probably

609
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,400
wouldn't have been thought of too much
is

610
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,860
being so see with terrorism SARS man
unfortunately hackers

611
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,270
hacking seems to be falling at least

612
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,660
someone in that I

613
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,259
in that group you know that group uva

614
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,670
phrase which is over broadly associate
is being

615
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,680
somewhat equivalent with with terrorism

616
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,750
so acting as legal terrorism
unfortunately the word

617
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,670
and taking out via in my mind had this
map of how close to

618
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,090
related terms are to one another i
little

619
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:44,940
latent semantic indexing semantic
differential in that something like that

620
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,580
right and I see the word hacker creeping
closer to the word terrorism

621
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,580
right not good not something we'd like
to see arm

622
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,069
so when we have we have some great
science and great poses round here that

623
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:57,740
are

624
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,000
I essentially saying that if you're if
you're thinking for yourself

625
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,770
and questioning authority in all these
things that we like to characterize as

626
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,350
both ethical and hacker oriented

627
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,920
activities or outlooks on life on

628
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,060
I we at the mock reserve the posters
then you see the real poses the real

629
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,380
questions like began sometimes implicit

630
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,280
that are saying that those activities
are something that are

631
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,610
maybe not terrorism right but they're
they're on the side

632
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:33,010
right questioning authority your arm I

633
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,540
you know speaking dirt about the I
government so forth in your

634
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,440
your supporting the terrace arm

635
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,570
to mention for

636
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,670
INS's this is are pretty close to a
direct statement

637
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,150
mesh just make a few I is something that
Robert Steele

638
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,210
night just chat about really briefly but
I got out of his Takei

639
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,930
treating hackers is that an actual
valuable national asset

640
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,330
I know people that can have an important
role

641
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,560
and now

642
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,799
very sites have defense very sexy
offense not just on

643
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,010
not just terrorism oriented arm

644
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:13,560
and I'll give a couple examples that
they said from from the actual

645
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,520
recruiting materials are used by

646
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,730
by the army and so forth I

647
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,870
computer as a tool for social and
political change not the same as

648
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,880
that's really saying as a weapon and

649
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,880
arm I'll we talked a little bit

650
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,170
couple years back when I talk by the
ethics of computing

651
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,500
is a your sheeple rate your more people
are willing to think for themselves

652
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,930
fewer people who are going to not think
themselves

653
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,299
the most part hackers as folks at think
for themselves think out the box

654
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:52,330
and I was pleasantly surprised to see
the our desire

655
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:55,460
in places like I said army intelligence
agency

656
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,460
places like that to you on to get such
people

657
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,220
right and an openness is going to be a
big change it's a Mac national security

658
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,190
calls for happen

659
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,380
arm if you change the

660
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,440
let's let's see get a maybe not I seven
or eight year old the CEA

661
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,700
preteen going through something like a
boot camp going through something like

662
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,890
an indoctrination

663
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,410
right so they're going to be an
effective essentially effective warrior

664
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:22,470
I no fit well into the chain of command
well they might have gone in because

665
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,740
they had great aptitude

666
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,160
for all these think out of the box type
things but what are you doing

667
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,560
putting a min in a in a mall so that
that's not going to work right

668
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,630
there Lisa my work for some purposes now
like this adds all

669
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,230
possible outcomes by Dom but I'll be
something that Woods

670
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,450
Belize partially squash what you're
looking for

671
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:47,050
in the first place arm okay I heard a
few other things different died in talks

672
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,920
for a couple good ones

673
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,740
night about job getting out there being
being active and

674
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,170
that's one thing that I encourage not
that I'm not quite sure

675
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:00,710
whited out what hacktivism is but job I
go again different different definitions

676
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:05,400
was basically getting off at your by I
have and I i anchors that always

677
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,460
okay what one more hour or so I'm going
right now

678
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,230
calendar especially yeah it's okay keep
talking this right now we're ready

679
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,270
happened and

680
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,509
national security colleges excluding the
regular military academies

681
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,250
there's also are American military
University which is already doing the

682
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:22,880
National

683
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,770
security studies and I already have
packing and stuff and

684
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,350
robber so should have known that because
his book is used as a text book

685
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:34,549
are the second thing is i Israel trains
hackers

686
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,150
and I do believe that cuba did at one
time I don't know if they still do

687
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,320
now you think out to know that those
military those in training

688
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:46,020
or mmm in israel all

689
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,190
II I don't know and i assume that inning
when they're trying to Cambridge

690
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,100
arm yet so and and and from my point of
view

691
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,470
I it's like it's almost like the

692
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,610
you know that the the saying about the
safe sex or something you know you want

693
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,870
your kids to learn the stuff on the
street right you want to learn

694
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,750
everything you know about drugs from
your friends we're out doing drugs are

695
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,880
you wanna get something

696
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,040
you know that that can be a little more

697
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,890
intentionally

698
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,940
presented right and I think that's part
the same thing you know is a right did

699
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,450
you want to be learning about breaking
the system's

700
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,890
without being given a pretty good
opportunity through dialogue

701
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:32,460
reflection so forth to give arm
reflection to the meanings are those

702
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,130
those actions so when you go out and and
do it then you're doing

703
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,600
whatever is a deal whatever it is no
everything from port scanning

704
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,060
do whatever extremely can think up I'm
you doing a thought for now

705
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,110
yet so it's so yeah that

706
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,000
there are definitely intelligence
colleges there's a there's there's

707
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,560
several

708
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,380
you know where they're going have
different classes and a and there's

709
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,610
actually some training stuff

710
00:40:54,610 --> 00:41:00,640
in the Odd Couple Josh a.m. EDT where
they say you know you like 11 weeks a

711
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,509
intense training and now way lol weeks
in phnom

712
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,340
I I this topic cryptography or something

713
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:13,760
arm okay so so as always I i questioner
subs about terrorism is

714
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,460
a confirm you are saying what hacking is
I know that I love you

715
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,050
for me talk about this before same I
want is going if you want to follow up

716
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:21,550
and now

717
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,290
calling to make agency the or email

718
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:28,340
currency the yuan I saw remarks expanded

719
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,710
notions there but done confirm your
understanding

720
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:35,310
love white the the actual on

721
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,400
what you hope for the actual ethics are
packing

722
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,280
and arm I take a look at the I

723
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,640
dice just as word substitution game
right and these are you just very common

724
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,529
things that that

725
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,590
to hear about in media criticism so

726
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,030
so what's the difference between a
freedom fighter and a guerilla right

727
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,740
well

728
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,140
I no sensually nothing just a label
that's used to

729
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,339
to apply to you know one group or
another group whether you want to give a

730
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,030
a positive impression ornate impression
the actions

731
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,640
are going to be all that different on I

732
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,549
yo terrace for the separatists are
terrorists verses what have you know

733
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,270
some thats

734
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,250
trying to to escapes over the American
revolutionaries

735
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:20,880
you know in the 1700s sweeney's
terrorists that were revolting against

736
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,320
you know the the proper unrighteous
government so it's so

737
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,290
so labels are important arm

738
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:31,580
and again because I said I believe that
demos were talking about is good because

739
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,730
the activity is good

740
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,580
I believe that the com are

741
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,830
essentially the more hacking the better
I think that the conclusion there

742
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,160
on let me i we have a comment and and I
you'll

743
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,500
you'll talk and while you're talking and
navigate to couple web pages

744
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,800
show I'm

745
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:58,800
to pick it up

746
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,049
you on was a regulation the US team

747
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:39,050
I essentially regulations is

748
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:43,160
over clearances I'm sorry now

749
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,000
me

750
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,190
so whether early trouble will will haunt
you later sort of inappropriately

751
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,080
yessir lead us yup

752
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,290
that's really happened near bankruptcy
stay with you for ten or twelve years

753
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,590
whatever is a mi mistakes have wave
coming back

754
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,240
arm and and records tend

755
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,170
did not be forgotten even though even
though they should have been arm

756
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:12,130
yessir so but the the security clearance
process and sounds like you're familiar

757
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,100
Dondero this originally I i did.

758
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,530
to go to a little less right my current
job arm

759
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,070
its size pretty darn thorough at the
higher levels you're talking about a

760
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,280
full background check

761
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,690
07 they unfortunately I think
unfortunately maybe not but the I

762
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,940
different agencies have different
classifications stuff like that are we

763
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,590
are interviewing for a job I had where I
work

764
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:34,920
I for position we had people

765
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,100
from the I'll sandia laps in the X
Division

766
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,920
by these are people with was called you
clearance are doing nuclear weapons

767
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,610
research

768
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,300
okay for are energy I have a feeling
that that the

769
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,490
maybe maybe a DUI at some level might've
been okay

770
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,410
but I have a feeling that that a prior
on conviction might've been a problem

771
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,870
getting into trouble after you have a
clearance is is probably a little bit

772
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:58,500
safer

773
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,330
within reason getting into trouble
earlier you and even at a younger age

774
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,259
is yelled at as you go higher and higher

775
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,870
is more likely in the clearance system
here are you more likely that's going to

776
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:10,740
come back and now

777
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:17,330
on you yeah so was a now right in the ad
is up legend in stop poindexter and all

778
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,770
you know I mean is there is the

779
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:22,100
and out what's the same the arm is a
radio

780
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,750
guy I G gordon liddy right he's done
pretty well with seven felonies or

781
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,330
something like that I don't know I don't
think get a i

782
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:32,620
an ex division clearance or not but yes
is a problem because because we were I

783
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,440
mean that there there plus a
questionnaire thinker that's where the

784
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,640
the direction

785
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,240
is I you know some people are getting
trouble breaking the rules at an early

786
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,220
age maybe some people are getting caught
some people are getting an appropriate

787
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,770
planet and properly punished

788
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,770
some people getting let off the hook
because they are you know whatever their

789
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,150
dad money that type thing

790
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,730
right May were missing out and I think
the whole message years maybe

791
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,280
or partitions at home it is tremendously
parliament it is you're missing out

792
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,240
on because hackers can or could be a

793
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:07,240
an actual nasa yeah on

794
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,020
see that as track

795
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,330
so no go away actually hit Safari but to

796
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:27,580
whatever so on so it's a go to i think
is go army

797
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,730
dot com on almost at a time

798
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:34,470
you gotta go army dot com on very
inspirational zone been there

799
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:37,760
recently you see the ads right arm

800
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,570
I advertising alive nigga look like a
lot of fun

801
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:45,760
in some ways anyway I i've

802
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,830
very brief I story out for a minor works
in algeria and Big Basin fairbanks where

803
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,840

by season's new recruits easier career
your captors have a crear

806
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,520
career army guy and I'm was psych

807
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,630

recruits and said dow why did you join

808
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,270

Roman everyone said aye aye

essentially everyone said the a money

811
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:17,340
which is it's pretty prominent on these
pages is a reason to join

812
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:21,109
and I'm the guy forces closer to my age
so yeah maybe

maybe 15 or 20 years old and some the
police talking to you and he said well I

joined it'd defend my country and no

816
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,270
so on select is what happens when his
way to a key words are

817
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,970
on one thing that comes up is electronic

818
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,060
I intelligence inception analyst

819
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:47,060
arm another one

820
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,500
is actually think the list so results

821
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,590
with the word hacker of course hackers
night we're not looking for hackers

822
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,630
is defending against hackers but to as
we know this this skill sets of and

823
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,820
pretty ap reseller

824
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,470
I Information System Operator analysts
talking cases operator maintainer so

825
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,250
basically systems types the ice

826
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,100
armed Field Artillery our artillery I
made a tactical data system specialist

827
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,290
on care intelligence Asian

828
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:19,190
electronic intelligence interceptor
Alice human intelligence collector

829
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,300
humint hours intelligence analysts I A

830
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,980
are psychological operations specialists
I cops

831
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,480
silence rather on usurp some pretty
heavy jobs

832
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,790
right where they're looking for for our
people

833
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,880
that have at least some elements are the

834
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,640
I love the skill sets that data make
akers hackers

835
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,640
you have just one more kiss in the last
couple minutes you find yourself course

836
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,129
arm I'm not gonna resizes because it
sits in a live web page that might 9

837
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,490
resize properly I National Security
Agency

838
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:56,560
they don't have quite as the are
full-featured AIM

839
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,580
I'll listen jobs in all this I call
class cations all the jobs millions

840
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,400
personnel

841
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,940
that South but got the crib now says
Qatar for

842
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,580
arm cryptology installers all those
things they're pretty

843
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,890
pretty prominently on so the point here
is that there actually are

844
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:17,299
arm job opportunities at RR

845
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,780
consistent in many ways with what makes
hackers hackers

846
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,109
I think they're in kansas as I said
before about the particles

847
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:29,020
and the the fact that maybe the the
stuff you need to do

848
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:34,040
clearances right wanna saluting in
uniforms and stuff like that

849
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,590
I might not be really all that are much
is our thing that you're right you're

850
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:38,619
hackers gonna do

851
00:49:38,619 --> 00:49:41,690
so that's out this early and the talk
job on

852
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,740
we're gonna get the next session in here
so I'm not going to stand up here too

853
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:45,550
much longer I'll

854
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:48,950
said how the way want to iChat a little
bit about it but

855
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:53,010
job are so we know that hackers are not
criminals

856
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:57,980
we know that hackers are not terrorists
on wanna my points is that is that

857
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,260
hackers could

858
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:03,290
be and in some ways should be at least

859
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,750
more not all of us course but should be
more

860
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:11,330
available as a as resource you know this
this potential

861
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:15,119
tool it calling people tools we know
that a potential part

862
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,810
I love the fight for good the fight for
defense and and so forth

863
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,400
arm and that's it so thanks come out
tonight

864
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,580
got to mars talk by hacking
territorially different with pork chop

865
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,950
with a much better sites
