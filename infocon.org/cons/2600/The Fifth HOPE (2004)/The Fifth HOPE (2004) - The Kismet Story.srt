1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,200
and has been download it exactly

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,200
a billion million times

3
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,270
okay well echoes bit more interesting
than the site we give extra time

4
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,229
be good idea if I i talked a bit about
how can I got started

5
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,930
and some what it can do for people who
haven't seen it before and then I

6
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,880
figured I'd take some questions from the
audience

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,920
and be entertaining for half an hour 45
minutes

8
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,080
sewer

9
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,760
for anybody who doesn't know I not her
surely be here if you don't know this

10
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,680
yet but a

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,020
his miss a.m. to 11 sniffer its snowfall
the

12
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,920
columbians you have the right cards that
can do it arm

13
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,930
it's completely passive and we're going
to lie thats good

14
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,790
later arm you can do some signatures and
some trend

15
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,430
IDS features on it arm runs on just
about anything that has drivers second

16
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,330
help that can support run on Linux and
BSD in OSX

17
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,039
are and plays nice with the other kids
on the block arm

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,700
don't agree with the other tools like
duplicate effort you don't need to

19
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,890
are if you doing we're driving stuff
which a lot of people obviously our

20
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,450
are you can do GPS coordinate logging

21
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,720
and use em struggling with the center
network is

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,209
good stuff like that and up

23
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:28,810
okay

24
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,850
and its client server architecture so
you can have more people who is

25
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,760
connecting to it

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,760
if you don't like the anchors is what I
did there is some in on-base turgid

27
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,760
k based ones and good stuff like that
where that is

28
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:54,130
okay well

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,290
will just pretend this is why I don't
like doing slides are

30
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,420
I think Sr everybody has to her did I
get the name a

31
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,430
go to dictionary dot com the consonance

32
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,540
profit there's no good story behind the
name

33
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,819
I think I put that stuff I think it puts
tumbler in and just click the synonyms

34
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,760
and play it something

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,760
so I'll

36
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,560
now it's working okay are

37
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,840
why why did I write it arm scratch an
itch

38
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,900
I think that's the reason most open
source offer gets written arm

39
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,260
couple years ago I picked up a wireless
card air started just come out it was a

40
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,768
little

41
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,989
text based thing and I was playing with
it into any didn't sell

42
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,209
scratch the itch call up something
together

43
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,239
it was a just modifications their store
in the beginning

44
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,730
and then I got a Cisco card which didn't
work with their snorts add support for

45
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,170
that

46
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,239
well-financed for online support both as
for both land they could

47
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,660
front with that make sense and became
took on its own life from there

48
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:08,660
and has eaten all my free time for the
last two years for supported platforms

49
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,650
are the core

50
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,280
development I do is on Linux are you
could try to argue me

51
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,690
to try to give you switch to be a city
or something but really it's taken me

52
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,020
six months to get links to pay for my
health on my laptop hardware and I'm not

53
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,180
too likely to reinstall

54
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,740
moment so worthy of receiving future the
best support platform will be when X

55
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,889
but I'm willing to help anyone with

56
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:37,990
other platforms drivers run all-sec
support I did last summer

57
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,430
arm the original air per card to work
with OS X but the airport extreme or not

58
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,240
and

59
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,630
back its meant I mention later why that
is but some BSD systems work some don't

60
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,900
arm because the drivers on OpenBSD to
present a driver's work

61
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,370
unfortunate rest the chipsets don't seem
to have drivers

62
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,930
report packets in monitor correctly are

63
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,080
authors in prison to work on FreeBSD 5

64
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,180
they don't work on FreeBSD for again
because the problems and monitor

65
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,849
and I haven't heard anyone really trying
to run it on

66
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:14,570
BST so if you're running on the PSD come
talk to me afterwards

67
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,690
Windows can

68
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,409
run it sort

69
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:24,640
arm there's no public drivers second do
Rupak

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,960
yet a there's something some people
working on hacking into

71
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,870
existing drivers by the only one I've
heard I've recently was

72
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,890
hacks to the prism to drivers and that
was just last week so we have

73
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,640
investigated

74
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,820
too much you can use it as a

75
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,830
client for other systems running
supported

76
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,010
drivers so if you have to use P 100 beds

77
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,240
differ from that were chemistry orcas
madrone or a wrt54g

78
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,440
access point running you can get your
data on the windows that way

79
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,020
segment whoever gets into

80
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,080
the differences between a sniffer in
Istanbul isn't actually a sniffer

81
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,190
arm allocated referred to the others
stumblers nets number many stone blur

82
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,880
max tumblers whole bunch from are

83
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,000
sniffers waxy capture the raw packet
data because it requires monitor mode to

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,610
be on so captures the Royal 211 where
data

85
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,280
but lost numbers will carry the cards
firmware

86
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,490
Elm the car will constantly look for
networks joint and

87
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,380
report to the operating system what
networks found that allowed in

88
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,889
and the summer just where is that so you
can't get data frames

89
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:41,530
but you don't usually need special
drivers so there's advantages and

90
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,260
disadvantages

91
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,169
disadvantages to both monitor

92
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,930
this is one that gets a lot of people
monitor mood verses promiscuous mode

93
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,650
monitor mode puts the card into are

94
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,159
rumbled word is not part of any network
it's just reporting all packets

95
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,650
sees 802 11 management the data frames

96
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,620
and everything else get reported the
operating system but they can't transmit

97
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,490
large monitor

98
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:12,130
promiscuous mode on wired Ethernet means
it turns off the children receives all

99
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,180
traffic on the network

100
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,389
in wireless mode usually it means that
you get

101
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,660
all the data frames on the network but
without the management headers

102
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,340
and only on the network their associated
with I sometimes it means nothing

103
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,729
different driver supported differently
in monitor mode requires support from

104
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:30,849
the chipset which almost

105
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:34,240
all the chipset do there's a fuse
there's a few exceptions

106
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,940
and not all the driver supported

107
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,270
and not all drivers and all the platform
support weight issues

108
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,990
just because of its network detection
completely passively

109
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,050
if you're running it other than know
they are from different standard by

110
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,520
running electronic device

111
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,169
there's no way to know you've got
anything sniffing the area

112
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:00,680
it's as if your car radios tuned station

113
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,120
monitor mode we can get all the
management frames

114
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,210
when we get all management rains we can
infer that the network is there even if

115
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,919
it's not

116
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,500
advertising itself as an open network

117
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,020
access points ten times a second usually

118
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,240
advertise Here I am I'm an access point
they're easy to find

119
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,210
ad hoc networks using beacon the same
way we can also find

120
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,449
people with laptops are looking for
network

121
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,479
if its network that's their we can find
that they're connected to a network

122
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,640
or if it's a network that isn't around
like say they work for a big company

123
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,689
and took the laptop home we can find out
what company begun apartment next door

124
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,690
works for if he's looking for network

125
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,600
that has the company's name in it arm

126
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,910
and no packets are sent by the sniffer
ever

127
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,390
the only exception to that is there's a
few buggy drivers which leave the card

128
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,390
probing

129
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,680
book it's it's something in the card for
itself not controlled by the operating

130
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,890
system

131
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,370
and passengers can detect active
stumblers liked nets number because

132
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,819
the card next summer's constantly
seeking out networks and that some were

133
00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:08,170
self sometimes

134
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,099
specifically sends frame saying I'm its
number

135
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,170
and is trying to uncover networks

136
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:22,170
using a

137
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,470
a startup a quick demo the features it's
gotten

138
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,490
cover few more things after that

139
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,220
so that's your standard readable that's
a standard window

140
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,490
home its just summarizes all the
networks has been to seeing at the time

141
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,600
you can certain network list by various
methods

142
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,220
and then extract info about each network

143
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,600
in detail like this is speed stream

144
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,330
there somewhere around here arm their

145
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,060
here they're talking on 11 be only max
311 megabit

146
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,200
and then just other information about
the network you can do

147
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,399
packet rate graphs and

148
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,410
well people values that is anything
specifically that people would be

149
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,240
interested in having

150
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,279
seeing with her right here's one that

151
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,160
is cloaked we haven't seen enough data
on cloak arm

152
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,199
the question was a on cooking and
societies:

153
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,680
kids will automatically de klerk the
SSID as soon as it sees enough data to

154
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,070
do it

155
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:47,070
arm action mention an expert
presentations at least interesting part

156
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,360
actually

157
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,360
just

158
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,050
ago area detecting networks security
isn't vendors like to come up with

159
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,009
measures that they call

160
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:14,749
security features that don't mean
anything in the end I

161
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:18,339
on the most common ones has been up is
clicking your SSID

162
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,110
I think links is started it but now just
about everyone supports it

163
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,439
all it means the AP doesn't put your
SSID

164
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:29,719
in the beacon packets the idea was to
keep people from knowing your

165
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,689
people who didn't know your network name
wouldn't be able to connect your network

166
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,319
which seems like a good idea

167
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,430
except the particles never designed to
hide that field

168
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,749
so since someone connects your network
your AP says I'll

169
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:45,649
right that's me and answers if you can
see all the frames

170
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:48,959
you can see that exchange your neck
legal network you don't even have to

171
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,459
touch the airwaves to do it there are
active ways to do it

172
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:57,639
other people for tools to do that
another temp was

173
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:01,059
turning off beating or reducing the
peking have access points if there are

174
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:01,889
no users on

175
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:05,120
they wouldn't generate data themselves
to announce their presence

176
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,269
which is a good idea until you have a
user on your network

177
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,350
at which point there you go there's a
network you're open again

178
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,209
and hiding network from passes never be

179
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,600
is needed or three Ortiz be down for
anything else from the air with that way

180
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,790
it's impossible Cesar transferring data
you talkin protocol you're in the air

181
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,420
someone can intercept see that you there
no matter what you do to try to hide

182
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,860
arm of course you can cryptic securely
and then you have a problem

183
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,019
borrows ideas functions and his men are

184
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,569
rudimentary the moment but will be
expanded in the future

185
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:45,259
arm the easiest part is fingerprint
matcher some tool send out very specific

186
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:45,899
frames

187
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,480
next on worth a mention sends out a
frame different versions have a little

188
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,429
different it's a text in them so we can
identify what version

189
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:56,889
get somewhere someone is running in the
area listen site survey

190
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:01,220
well and writer which I know not
pronouncing right but node

191
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,819
I don't have anyone really knows how to
pronounce them arm

192
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:08,839
and so the 802 11 taxers single frame
sent are

193
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,499
very easy to fingerprint so those are
always a hundred percent you see that

194
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,209
frame you know someone's doing that
attack

195
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,529
so that's the easiest yesterday trend
based IDS ng

196
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,449
is little bit more difficult arc is
basically uses a finite-state

197
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:27,879
gonna machine where it hops to different
states depending on what done the

198
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,629
protocols doing so we can tell someone
is going

199
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:33,899
outside the protocol to try to correct
things

200
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,779
or if there's certain number standard
packets in a short amount of time

201
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,170
we can detect that pattern and thats

202
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,799
an attack when otherwise a single frame
would constitute an attack

203
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,689
so flooding access points moving and

204
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:52,899
detection affected sniffers that are
sending out specific frames

205
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,069
arm that someone doesn't always do it
but weakened

206
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,699
we can tell by their behavior that
they're trying to connect to all the

207
00:13:58,699 --> 00:13:59,579
networks in the area

208
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,629
the networks are allowing them in in
there never using the networks

209
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:08,769
cell their skin do distributed

210
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:13,199
ideas for kids now there's a lightweight
version because its server that

211
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,029
simply captures packets of the wireless
and awesome underwater

212
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:20,100
so you can cover an entire building

213
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,860
with very small sniffers and report all
back to a central location

214
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,879
the crib the data run-through IDS and
have your

215
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,189
networks management Council displaying
all that

216
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:36,000
the stripped-down drones run on 46 is
access points

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,339
and helds pretty much anything you want
run it's a very small

218
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,589
application and we can do

219
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,429
what Christian on the entire network in
one location

220
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:53,329
and cooperating with the other kids on
the playground

221
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:56,790
units plus fees always been right number
small to

222
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,120
are small tools to do specific things
interoperate with each other

223
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,129
so you can build larger emergent systems
are the smaller tools

224
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:06,389
you look at string utils all things like
that to come

225
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,470
core utils come UNIX design with that
philosophy

226
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,089
so I try to go along with that with
Jasmine arm

227
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:16,750
there's no reason to duplicate effort
there really is one of the best

228
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,709
open source packet two sectors out there
there's no point replicating

229
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:24,039
to make it cold for a no gain so

230
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,949
because it works material anything that
creepy kept files can read his missiles

231
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:32,929
home so you can load it in drift net to
speed on but the real

232
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:36,980
D Smith anything you like that the sex
packets

233
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,789
you can do live packet streaming for IDS
functions

234
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:45,579
so kismet condoned live all the packets
after key crops the web

235
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,000
to a pipe link that to snort you get
layer 3 IDS even if your networking

236
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,799
cryptid

237
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,910
and you can connect the entire drone the
entire network with drones

238
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,480
through the one pipe to the IDS and

239
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,579
use it as layer three rds wellesley
archer

240
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,600
and all the log files a written as XML
so anyone who needs to

241
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,699
the process that another network into
another tool

242
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:13,470
webpage viewers log aggregators audit
records

243
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:20,269
things like that all the output is saved
in XML

244
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,339
for were driving inside ordering the
more interesting component other is GPS

245
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:24,959
map

246
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,039
which takes all the Excel files

247
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,199
they were generated Elm all released on
topic maps

248
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,559
from public sites like terror server or

249
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,319
MapQuest map plaster sure the map
sources

250
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,730
and lets you pop graphically

251
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,740
the maps you had taking graph networks

252
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,529
about a dozen different ways best ways
to look at the the remain see what's

253
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:51,679
appropriate for you do

254
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,769
you do not work center guessing you can
do the smallest polygon

255
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:59,059
fits all the sample points you can see
with the absolute coverage %uh view

256
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,269
network is

257
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,919
you can do range estimation you can do
power estimation

258
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,679
interpolation and you can color my
channel so if you do an essay on it you

259
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:09,850
can see where

260
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,079
other access points are going to be
stomping on your channels in causing

261
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,209
contention

262
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,799
and other things like that got a few

263
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,638
yeah was a freedom not too visible but
that snapple the access points near

264
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:28,110
my apartment and that's a signal
interpolation

265
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,770
where it attempts to use a signal levels
knows to guess

266
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,250
estimated signal levels around the known
sample points

267
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,159
and it's good for auditing

268
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,399
so cards at work well I'm hesitant to
endorse

269
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,010
specific cards more than others but
these are known to work

270
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,030
quite well prison to based carts

271
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,530
snow ingenious to martek and

272
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,020
high-power SMC Cardinal ones are all

273
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,100
really good cards got external antenna
jacks

274
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,429
in the present chipsets very well
understood cells been working with open

275
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:03,220
source

276
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,460
for a while now and

277
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,100
if you're looking to do in wireless
hacking stuff looking gossett appearance

278
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,919
offer controlled access points

279
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,010
arm running kismet running sniffers
doing

280
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,799
transmission experimenting with that
present is the way to go

281
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,679
probably the best cars and get out down
there are only about fifty dollars sixty

282
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,440
dollars for

283
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,270
really good are Orinoco or no coz work
very well

284
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,289
the original ones with the square in
tennis

285
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:34,419
the new or no coz have us short around
in 10 really excited guy in the front

286
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:35,710
going

287
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,419
with a suitcase I don't know why he's
carrying suitcases being really excited

288
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,929
about wireless

289
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,899
they don't work it

290
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:50,780
so maybe saying J i cant use my card

291
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,080
so it's really it's an unfortunate thing
because they have the same name

292
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,879
and Orinoco even or rather proxim now
owns them

293
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:02,789
branded in the same as or no classic so
you can even say

294
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:06,070
yet the original classic cards

295
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,980
so you gonna get one get of the day be
really sure about what

296
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,149
you're getting hopefully the new ones
will have monitor mode supports

297
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:18,510
by at the moment they don't work in 26
and they don't have mine

298
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,530
are authors based carts actually the
Orinoco

299
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,690
Beng cars Arthur spaced arm most to the
other

300
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,889
a BNG cards are also Thursday's they
work well

301
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:34,850
the mad wifi drivers and 1x in FreeBSD
work well with them

302
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,149
and they do the job you to sniff across
mobile vans

303
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:43,240
and prison duty 802 11g cards also work
well

304
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,480
others drivers for them and 1x I don't
know three stars

305
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,679
BST anyone

306
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,899
happen to know with your hand up okay

307
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:59,899
missing they don't work in BC I haven't
heard anything about them work BST

308
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,059
right idea the net wifi drivers were
were BST imported Linex

309
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,460
and I think they're pretty much Co
develop now on both platforms the same

310
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,049
by Rick or right

311
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:17,799
saying and how they were originally
written for BST ported to Linux

312
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,908
and now they're operating on both and
they're pretty good they're pretty good

313
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:21,830
driver said

314
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,740
and their the most reliable one on
FreeBSD need to rent isn't there

315
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,520
cards that work but are is stable or the
drivers haven't been around as long for

316
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,918
as others

317
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,740
airports on OSX loading the drivers in
under OSX

318
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,040
little funny and I've been told that
under the new versions sex

319
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,250
once you load the driver for sniffing
you have to reboot

320
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,520
to get normal operation back

321
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,740
%uh Centrino drivers just added monitor
mode

322
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,369
for 1x about a month ago

323
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:57,879
by they added the but the they decide to
not screen corrupted packets

324
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:02,450
bookworm the field that lets you
detected script to pack

325
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,010
cell you can see thousands of take
networks

326
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,490
sniffing at the moment should be fixed
soon Cisco

327
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,109
two years ago with her sister was really
good anyone was here two years ago for

328
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:14,609
the talk a single Cisco

329
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:17,609
get a Cisco good the hardware is good

330
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,158
the drivers are there a unfortunately
seem to be going downfield

331
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,850
tact I stopped using my Cisco has my
full time card

332
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,809
there is getting so flaky arm with
monitor mode the Cisco drivers

333
00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:33,799
don't hop are they hot channels but you
can't control we're hoping

334
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,940
so their unfortunate I would really
recommend a Cisco at this point

335
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,840
also the latest firmware from Cisco
doesn't work with any the open source

336
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
drivers

337
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,480
and as far as I know they haven't
released any info to let that happen

338
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,460
a CX 102 chipset used in the 22 megabit

339
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,020
cards from dealing in a few others they
work

340
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:02,149
the drivers are fairly new they weren't
that stable and I played with them

341
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm if you card that works it'll
probably work and ATM tech

342
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,399
recently there's GPL drivers ed

343
00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:12,840
under support because it will support
those drivers

344
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,799
arm the other binary drivers there is a
hack to them

345
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,929
to let them work but they weren't
entirely stable

346
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:24,470
are cards that definitely will not work
fortunately

347
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,020
Broadcom anything that uses Broadcom
you're basically screwed

348
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,730
you can you get it working in normal
mode on a free operating system right

349
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,340
now

350
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,459
without using something like and his
record it loads

351
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,190
Windows drivers into the Linux kernel
which

352
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,869
isn't a good idea cell Broadcom

353
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,070
what really sticks last I heard they
were even willing to admit that people

354
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,350
use Linux

355
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,710
so arm

356
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,109
Airport Extreme it's just a Broadcom the
Regional Airport was basically just nor

357
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,049
no code extreme is just a Broadcom

358
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,679
same problems are as near as I was being
able to tell

359
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,389
at No has will monitor mode in the
firmware

360
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:06,669
are did just can't do it cell

361
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:10,869
those are supported the probably never
will be Realtech

362
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:14,109
there's no mono my remote support the
drivers that there are now

363
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:18,389
and I hadn't heard of anyone working on
adding it or if the radio even supports

364
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:22,159
and Hermes to a is the new Orinoco
chipset

365
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,500
there's no support now but there will be
hopefully soon

366
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,770
either in the 26 drivers they're looking
at adding support for

367
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,350
or they'll get added to the proxy
drivers

368
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,100
and a some other tools that people in
wanna check out but they don't wanna run

369
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,049
Linux or BSD for this

370
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:42,530
net somewhere for Windows obviously his
Mac

371
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,178
for OSX is as he has nothing to do with
kismet other than the insularity but the

372
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:51,159
functionality is almost the same and
they've got a very nice GUI

373
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:54,609
so if you're looking to use it on a Mac
that might be a better choice

374
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:58,689
and of course serial to tcp/ip which
once a packed

375
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,159
everyone's favorite packet sniffers

376
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,909
and that's all I had pre-written arm

377
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:09,000
I can take some questions people on I'd
like to try to keep away from the tech

378
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,139
support more on

379
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:16,340
planning or whatever

380
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,020
I guess yeah I guess I just line up
there's enough people questions

381
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,260
I'm web is broken what do you think the
EPA

382
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,960
it's better than where it's probably
good enough for home I haven't heard

383
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,379
anything that convinces me it's good
enough for a business or like a doctor's

384
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:33,490
office where

385
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,700
keeping the data secure is that
important are

386
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,690
right now is because detective EPA
specifically but Wilson

387
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,869
arm later this summer will be doing

388
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:47,129
big rewrite of it I'll be going to be
really

389
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:50,450
arm you Royal we

390
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,210
are I'll be doing a big rewrite have a
lot to the code trying to make it

391
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,280
smaller faster

392
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,820
and I'll be adding lot of things that
have been pending for the past few

393
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,418
months

394
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:03,629
because I've been wrapped up helping
these guys Lars here

395
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:07,100
is a is 802 11

396
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,389
management its owner like transport
layer

397
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:14,940
yeah arm did Scott is on our Petters

398
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,030
and yet it's only a two protocol arm

399
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,470
your best bet the IEEE 11b specter with
the public now she'll find

400
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,980
Google arm or talk to me afterwards a
share

401
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,619
are yeah it's it's own layer 2 protocol

402
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:35,409
it defines what networks are there it
controls joining and leaving a network

403
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,580
and its really naive bad

404
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,199
protocol honestly arm

405
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,440
we mention it someone the talk yesterday
to almost to the problems

406
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,960
that we're seeing with wireless now is
because a a naive protocol design the

407
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,869
beginning

408
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:56,669
and Canton backwards compatibility has
to retain the problems of purple

409
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:00,270
are it defines networks where to with no

410
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,520
encryption you don't trip management
frames the only authentic Asian is your

411
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,309
Mac Address

412
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:08,850
who can copy mac Address treatment frame
ok there's new network

413
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,220
well there's never telling you it's gone
you know take your pick

414
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,909
sir in in terms of the

415
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,919
yes we're here doing right

416
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,919
you know the patch smart to do

417
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,280
like what is likely future terms like

418
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,460
Wireless yes like the you can become

419
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,879
yes you know keeping between

420
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:39,289
will or actually running an active IDS

421
00:26:39,289 --> 00:26:42,600
here I'll we'll talk about it tomorrow
the network thing

422
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,090
arm it's a combination of some raw
transmitters of kismet

423
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,830
in a bunch custom code so it will the
the AP's lacked to protect themselves to

424
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,359
a certain extent

425
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:56,289
arm as far as I get around his head
right now i think is at the very

426
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:56,850
beginning

427
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,690
its life span are I wanna make it so
that

428
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,320
its more like snow or you can plug
things into modifying the code

429
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,460
arm modularized more do you think that

430
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,490
is currently I'm running couple drones
the only thing is

431
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,679
it seems more easier

432
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,629
people to type everything directly into

433
00:27:18,629 --> 00:27:22,549
doing is pretty much

434
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:26,510
well the idea because it was to do the
layer to RTS the

435
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,859
radio level lasso 802 11 attacks

436
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,899
we could detect at that level and then
let's not handle the

437
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:36,340
peace feeler the ocular thanks

438
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:43,340
so yeah

439
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:49,659
art

440
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:52,960
the same time missus first

441
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,520
strings start strong

442
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,869
right now just to get a string logging
thats waiting until I rewrite the whole

443
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:01,889
logging system

444
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:05,190
try to make it all modular so there
could be plugin so we construe about

445
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,510
stuff you don't need for handheld
systems

446
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,690
things like that arm where

447
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,849
kismet determine if it's going to
extract a string based on packet

448
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:14,450
interviews

449
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,609
I have to see exactly what youre packet
was

450
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:21,060
to figure out why it showed up in one
and not the other

451
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:27,069
placemark strange

452
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:30,928
I have to take a look at the log files

453
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:34,210
is it does a lot to verify that the
packet seeing is valid

454
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:40,000
arm Israel doesn't cell kid try to do
too much processing on a packet that's

455
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,030
corrupt because Islam drivers if you
describe frames

456
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,310
so that might be what you're saying I
have

457
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,899
lock yes how much him

458
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:52,919
you like cable his

459
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:58,429
a lot of memory mater in on a CPU

460
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,929
I don't have exact numbers on it but the
the built-in

461
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:05,429
tables acres runs are no

462
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:09,560
forty or fifty lines in the Big O U I
table set to make text file

463
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,290
what you map that the hash map other
issues to do lookups internally

464
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,460
you talk a big chunk a memory which is
why don't do it automatically but you

465
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:16,720
know

466
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,720
it got it running on laptop upon your am
a red

467
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:31,250
to question Chur one could you

468
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:36,069
are the the question was relationship
between kismet and his neck

469
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:39,379
I am because Mac eyes when downloads
never and

470
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:42,629
username summer thats prematurely
relationship

471
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:47,579
they are they did a good job it's pretty
slick sniffer it's all in objective-c

472
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,530
arm I don't like objective-c amazing
wrote that much of it so

473
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,690
good on them are they seem to be really
doing a good job with the OS X stuff

474
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,609
to do is very nice so if you're looking
it is recommended if you're looking for

475
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:02,919
something with a prettier girl we then
and curses

476
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,119
you might want to look into that because
I don't have no sex fucked

477
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,710
OS X Box development on cell and get to

478
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:17,050
all she plays much on that platform

479
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,510
second are you aware any attempts

480
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:25,629
to passes any work in like protecting
passu

481
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:28,829
offers I haven't really heard much

482
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:32,079
I mean ice the only really do will be at
the RF where

483
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,158
arm detecting that there is

484
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,450
something resident on their frequency in
the area the

485
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:42,159
the radio so shouldn't transmit anything
although it is

486
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,220
antenna hooked up to hunger electronics
so

487
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,379
arm I have heard of anyone really
working on it

488
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:52,470
arm I suppose something kinda like
campus to be able to detect that there's

489
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:55,260
a laptop in the area

490
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,109
arm anybody hear anything about their

491
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:06,109
razor

492
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,470
the answer was a Israel concepts that
can be used to look for scanners

493
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,750
but they're really sketchy and probably
not applicable 211

494
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,490
arm I wouldn't take that is guaranteed
and was gonna

495
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,460
detect you doing something if you're
somewhere you really shouldn't be that

496
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,630
the really looking for you

497
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:30,540
but Chang there it's not something
simple and it's not something

498
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,270
most places will be able to handle cell

499
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:41,270
two things

500
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,250
we ever gonna be able to get channel
hopping working on RT

501
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,980
orgies is that to render their up

502
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,770
that's just my and good question the
question is our channel hopping

503
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,170
on Lexus access points are that's
actually just that I hadn't

504
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,440
written it in because when I wrote it I
didn't want to break people's access

505
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,060
points

506
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,210
from rejoice sure what apk file

507
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,330
yeah I'll by a stroke of luck are the
links is access points can be

508
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,280
an access point and monitor mode at the
same time so you can rent is an online

509
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,410
sniff your own network into ideas in
your network from your access point

510
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,250
fuck nice product other thing is

511
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,290
if you're doing a rewrite anyways
century don't data strings

512
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,620
any certain probability drift net
actually drove network

513
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,380
with should read from the 50 directly
already

514
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:40,580
and it should abrupt & Co added support
for to understand

515
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,750
at 11:04 matted frame so we can do

516
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,780
Ross if you're just in monitor mode the
park is

517
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,990
Andrew independently and it won't do the
packet filtering wanna kiss does

518
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:56,080
but it would let you see images at the
same time

519
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,700
at thanks man ever more interesting but
you should be able to just start of the

520
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,300
faithful type

521
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,290
right to drift net and use that to you
all the images from

522
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,210
the drum network whenever you have work
I intended to use one year

523
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,470
sniffing I have a ATVI

524
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,500
army bolted to the river my car and

525
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,110
yes stereo typical I know arm

526
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,130
and my Dempster

527
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:28,930
type yeah I 780 be on me that I have
bought into the car and a

528
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,080
really modified IBM network PC that was
designed

529
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,250
token ring in a job operating system are

530
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,640
tweaked into running yes they made them
there about six hundred dollars they

531
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,650
don't make them anymore

532
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,050
that's why arm its

533
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,320
a Pentium 233 so I just have a feeling
of compact flash it was in my car

534
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,700
runs all the time sir yeah I'll

535
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,800
my long time said five minutes

536
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,860
okay arm see our I'd recommend if you're

537
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,630
series but when we're driving stuff just
curious about it external

538
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:08,180
antenna will really help you getting the
receiver outside epic metal box

539
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:15,179
makes a really big difference your
questions

540
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:23,049
there's not a chance I can hear you
without Mike from

541
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:29,259
okay

542
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,849
it so we are saying is a to pape

543
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:36,510
kismet to some sort of like that
analyzer

544
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,879
thinking just do like a standard it by
right are

545
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:44,589
you can configure to open the faithful
type anywhere you want and it will do a

546
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:45,949
live don't up the

547
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:50,029
secret to packets it also do packet
mingling so it'll take a web packet d

548
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,700
cryptid

549
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:56,210
mingling looking like it was a standard
802 11 on web packet and shoot into the

550
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:56,619
pipe

551
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:00,720
I'll screen on the John packets and then
you can just open a pipe with anything

552
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,569
rebel

553
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:08,569
I will vacate for the next person then

554
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,759
think I'll be ready
