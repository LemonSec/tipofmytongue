1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,009
the red using grid computing

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,060
system so we are we hooked up a little
earlier in the year

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,400
and I came up with this talk idea and

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,450
some %uh view know will will will lay
the groundwork in South with some you

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,230
know that the

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:20,439
the Terra grid was hacked sorta famously
in about April they had some ongoing

7
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,779
security problems and a got a lot of
publicity

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,789
and Wiley out that we know nothing about
that

9
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:31,359
okay we don't know anything I'm not I
even though I i workers Supercomputing

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,730
Center and I know people at Summerset
computing centers that were affected

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,980
I have no inside knowledge whatsoever
and I we don't know who died and we are

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,820
we came up with our proposal for the
talk before those things

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,690
I happened so innocent arm

14
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,800
just just just let you know and I did
get the email from

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,879
from someone at and at NCSA security the
National Center for supercomputing

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,788
applications

17
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,579
when the Faith Hope I speaker schedule
one out those

18
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,710
or way it was up to God to Slashdot add
I said dude

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,540
on

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,420
could you let us know where you gonna
talk about before you go and talk about

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,189
it at the conference I said yeah dude

22
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:16,299
arm & Poor's I we know we're going to
talk about until just recently

23
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,560
so I'm not quite not quite on with that

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,790
to that promise okay here we go

25
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,900
and

26
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,329
doing these okay here we go

27
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:35,860
the surficial slide great okay says us
we got where couple URL's

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,479
on here we are are we've been involved
with the conference but as I said we do

29
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,399
other stuff as well in this is this is
part of it

30
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,820
so arm there's a lot of excitement

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,969
about grid computing there's also a lot
of fun things are kinda difficult to

32
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:50,780
understand

33
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,430
and it takes a while is a like a lot of
these technical things are

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,890
us a steep learning curve threat talk a
little bit about the

35
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,000
the general great environment some the
standards that are coming out

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,789
talk about what grid computing is all
urs or a general stuff are we also want

37
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:05,740
to share with you

38
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,600
solve our experiences in getting bread
%uh software particularly the Globus

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,210
Toolkit

40
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,420
and related documents up and running and
we also and we end with others be

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:18,410
pretty informative wells have a bunch of
comments and as I said no new axe plates

42
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:18,870
no

43
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,580
you know no announcements have
heretofore unknown weaknesses

44
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,040
by job but a few comments about
weaknesses in the

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,829
I grid computing infrastructure the
software deployment the practice like

46
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,330
the policy on different aspects without
potential and in some cases actual

47
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,450
security weaknesses

48
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,500
and Dom of course some recommendations

49
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,880
for our either if you're if you're
looking to you are to be the next

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,210
person that accident read things look
for or %ah

51
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,020
prolly little more relevant for people
arm are

52
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,790
in the hockey listening to the stock is

53
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,130
what would you do to make your system
stronger no more easily in

54
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,890
to some serve attack so on

55
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,430
so we got as usual more stuff then then
we can deal with this kind of the

56
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,090
outline

57
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,550
I what is no review I talk about globus

58
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,690
arm let's go ahead and do the what is
and then what I'm gonna do

59
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,510
is our nice little wanna go home get
started now I get the star now

60
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,859
so one what one of our %ah one things
one talk about as fact that

61
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,930
globus software which is kinda the
standard if you're if you want to say

62
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,800
what's grid

63
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,220
10 things you can say as well you know
we're using bogus s as what makes it a

64
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,500
great computing environment versus
something else

65
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,670
arm Lewis is a huge

66
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,030
difficult to install that got him as a
package some operating on my 17-inch

67
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,610
Power Mac g4 here ours and I can try to
actually install blow beside

68
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,720
I think it can be done but haven't have
never tried but let's go to the ER

69
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,720
directory on I know that you might not
see that entirely but

70
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,810
to let me show you what's here all this
explain it to you and we'll get

71
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,620
something running

72
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,130
and then we'll talking we'll come back
and I'll probably still be running these

73
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,410
are the I packages

74
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,450
the arm Globus Toolkit packages

75
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,610
so the Globus Toolkit a source installer

76
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,370
which is basically what you need I if
you get a binary distribution for this

77
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,750
package that will talk about

78
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,880
you try the binaries right install

79
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,290
and their less well

80
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,180
there's sometimes more reliable
sometimes there use

81
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,440
right exactly i mean the the end and
usually if you get a binary

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,690
you having trouble and you are on a
mailing list they say dude

83
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,620
got install from source right I'm is all
Java code so your job compilers usually

84
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,370
are pleasingly

85
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,430
gas anyway on and I and these are many
many packages

86
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,080
so close look at version not three-point
3.0 the arm

87
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,229
are sore since dollar is our

88
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,400
I was whatevers 123 om answers at this
or that was about to 64

89
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,400
maker cell compressed zipped out source
code

90
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,060
so that's a lot and we can I already
decompressing go down to the

91
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,700
source code in Soller directory and we
see we have a

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,390
I already did a build build hyphen old
on a move it over

93
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,919
and so we can do with this is a shell is
why I'm running the show at DWC

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,690
are star star slash star Java

95
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,890
and a recursively descend all the
directories missiles the shell track

96
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,110
you can use the shell to try using
anything other than born show with your

97
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,070
experiences

98
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,130
laurie is born yeah it's like it's like
year it you're very constrained in many

99
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,730
cases

100
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,790
born shell is that I it counted 239

101
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,700
thousand lines a Java code others
including e-mail blank lines

102
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,010
comments and stuff like that thing I
county lines of code

103
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,000
on you know might be a a smaller number
and that's just a Java code is also four

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,670
CIA

105
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,700
the build-out XML files at the and
installer uses is also the home

106
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,020
I'll that some was all files is all
kinds of different things

107
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,139
they're down there so on so big huge
monstrous complicated package

108
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:05,500
and if you look in phnom if you look in
that directory

109
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,930
you see that it's basically a package
%uh packages these are

110
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,780
this is from a bill that is just the
other day to set as the others would

111
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,580
work

112
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,950
and I Z is Jesse's bunch of tar tar GZ
stuff

113
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,330
and then that the actual installation
directories so the message here Zack

114
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,650
Lois is complicated and really I'm duly
so and of course complication when you

115
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,050
have many lines of code

116
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,550
mean statistically their bikes right and
against it is sickly summer those bugs

117
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,760
will be security

118
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,180
related so let's just go ahead and will
%ah a

119
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,780
get this running there's little install
script

120
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,830
you tell it where to go just an
arbitrary place

121
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,650
I'm not going to actually day remove
that drug treatment to remove that

122
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:52,650
record first

123
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,330
OKC is runs a little install script to
basically knows all that many many

124
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:06,950
packages

125
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,599
your destination directory so we are now
building the Globus Toolkit

126
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,680
okay now we're gonna go on to the
restaurant talk and I think

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,560
unless we forget the look we're gonna
come back later the close of course all

128
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,040
the building on the streets 50

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,550
i reasonably fast a laptop computer and

130
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,550
arm this is part of why their barred my
identification security holes

131
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,830
in grid computing because is painful to

132
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,380
decks and as I said you go out and say
gee you know I think there's an error in

133
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,620
this little package in a try doing a
little tweak night riding this little

134
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,100
tweak

135
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,880
the answer on the globus mailing list is
re install from source

136
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,800
right and if you have to go back in and
apply whatever changes you discover the

137
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,460
first time

138
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,440
all right let's talk about what is going
computing and and and that'll make more

139
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,860
sense views we arm

140
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,800
as we go on so there's a relationship
between grid computing parallel

141
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,220
computing cluster computing

142
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,060
arm a other you know shared memory
computing

143
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,330
essentially what you're doing is using
multiple processors together

144
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,500
getting data and our man's back and
forth somehow

145
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,490
and then getting results back to you to
whoever needs are met the and

146
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,150
armed with grid computing typically what
you doing is arm

147
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,740
are having a slower networks is not a
cluster is like a mirror net or

148
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,540
something like that

149
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,630
yeah the ability to have a hybrid set a
system so rather than having

150
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,880
are you on a classy help us write him to
use right have not drawn

151
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,990
cluster armed with a grade you could
have

152
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,520
a grid which is all kinds different %uh
source computers

153
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,659
and on soon I can guarantee Elaine C you
na can require

154
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,730
a homogeneous a relatively homogeneous
our competition architecture

155
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:49,380
and arm are what that means is that
you're gonna look at problems that are

156
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,050
that don't require a whole lot of
communication if you have like let's say

157
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,920
at a %uh shared memory problem

158
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,079
where you need to get data from place to
place like from one possible explosives

159
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,960
next processor

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,920
now be a typical parallel massive
parallel computing environment shared

161
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,349
memory

162
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,360
that that sort of thing arm that's we're
having very low

163
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,740
access to do communication or or
transfer data

164
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,280
from 10 to the other that's not a good
type a problem for a great system

165
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,030
because yet separate systems

166
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,720
and they're using this red
infrastructure which is like web

167
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,710
services except it's called grid
services you're not using a high-speed

168
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,820
interconnect

169
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,540
Elaine see all that stuff you're looking
at problems for grid computing which are

170
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,219
essentially coarse-grained parallel

171
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,220
as opposed to finding parallels post
cereal on

172
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,600
the word rate is everywhere we don't we
don't have the type that vendors here

173
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,340
but when you wanna its trade shows

174
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,390
are you everything's great you know
Oracle 10g is Oracle 10 grid

175
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,699
son is doing great IBM is big and bread
arm

176
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,220
the word rate is over used to mean
essentially any distributed

177
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,150
sometimes is any distributed environment
for about heterogenous arm

178
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,150
for our purposes or the

179
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,189
the standard that we're gonna stick with
even though as they say there are other

180
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,130
definitions they're reasonably
acceptable

181
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,580
but we're going to talk about the globus
red the Global Grid Forum are

182
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,210
is this group that saw formed after the
model the i-eighty at then

183
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,570
and II B three C in these other
standards organizations

184
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,480
trying to form our grid standards and
globus

185
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
and other components lol will touch on a
little bit here are

186
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,910
are parlor standards now the standards
just like way back in the

187
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,459
browser war days the standards are
emerging at the same time that

188
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,270
application the products are merging

189
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,960
which means that really is kinda
free-for-all but were in focus in on

190
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,960
globus

191
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,340
okay

192
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,890
I'm not going to go through dollars in
great detail I get the supplied to

193
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,730
petascale

194
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,940
our necks in a while and you can email
me 5 like the presentation link

195
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:01,240
arm the ER

196
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,000
Globus Toolkit I mentioned OG SA is this
systems architecture design there's

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,750
InDesign documents are undergoing a
major change now

198
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,860
done before one sorta way of doing
things to another sort of way to end

199
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,930
things more a

200
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,330
your potential for for problems

201
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,500
to to happen and one thing that sock
kind of cool

202
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,620
is at about the current changes a move
to

203
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,930
web basing things on Web Services and

204
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,600
by some people program with Web services
la web services out there

205
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,140
our Web Services on is built into

206
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,340
product like WebSphere at least once in
the ring incarnations

207
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,870
operates also implemented as part of the

208
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,120
said Apache Software Foundation products
is a little package if tom cat in

209
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,300
Jakarta and hand and some other things

210
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,520
that they days or loosely group together
as web services

211
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,960
essentially this is a way of sharing
work among computers using

212
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,000
om are something pretty similar to http

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,810
he saw report at: our communication are
with the odd

214
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,420
I some abilities to build things like
quality of service

215
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,560
encryption and so forth on it but not
really built in

216
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,270
like lois is intending to do what we
optimistic that a No

217
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,699
yeah I is there gonna they're going to
take a web service is free market had

218
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,420
the security

219
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,079
I'll Aaron had the other types of things
that occasion so forth that

220
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,550
to their car well thats will manage to
do it words

221
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,710
dance to be seen is whether or not they
do well back a pretty good about its

222
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,260
getting things done that they say
they're down on it's just that there's

223
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,830
always

224
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:42,680
extra bucks but you never really expect
the %ah

225
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,290
the main thing that is component a Brit
securities is this I later phase here

226
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:47,689
this for

227
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,130
idea virtual organization RVL on so
you're on the web

228
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,350
right if you wanna make your stuff
available on the web you have this nice

229
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,680
all CGI programs can be surprising

230
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,390
prison results kinda your kind of stock

231
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,020
in terms of your ability to arm restrict
access

232
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:10,069
that somehow because you haven't done
each the Access file Somerset password

233
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,170
sesame might use secure I'll wet
transfer

234
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,790
GPS with certificates and so forth

235
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,849
on being a lot of fine-grained control
with a virtual organization

236
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,290
does it basically gives you a access
control lists on application

237
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,209
level and it says okay here then we we
later on that

238
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,220
certificates say say okay here the I

239
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,550
the different systems that are out there
that are allowed to

240
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,790
get access to the Service and I and you
can even have more granularity

241
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,849
nap is basically a a finer grain level
access control

242
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,530
NEC with the generic our web server

243
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,610
your web services this concept is really
important

244
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,560
because what it means is armed police
conceptually and I don't know that

245
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,220
many places early doing it arm for
rivalries but conceptually

246
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,170
you could use this for enterprise types
have cut our communications computing

247
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,330
you could use it for

248
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,530
even secure are computing environments
be

249
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,980
you know the scent which he trusts
implementation so forth but is designed

250
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,170
to be a list setup

251
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,600
essentially an arbitrary group with
systems they might

252
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,340
I'll be in same organization name IP
across the internet you know anywhere

253
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,520
are into a virtual organization have a
level of trust

254
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,020
and dialoguing an occasional itself
within the virtual organization

255
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,250
that's kinda cool selling point about
grid services that make it a lot

256
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,580
different web services

257
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,700
more answers here course one talk about
sanitation

258
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,650
authorization there's a.m. one point
that's very important know about

259
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,030
go listen to know about something is
that there's a very big difference

260
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,770
between authentication and authorization
home

261
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,069
had a little polar accidentally created

262
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,990
authentication is the verification of
the identity of promoted

263
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,160
the remote person knowing that you are
bob

264
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,250
is authentication that doesn't
necessarily mean that bob is authorized

265
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,190
to use this machine

266
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,230
with globus you have

267
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,440
extra certificates that say and

268
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,920
you can prove that you are this person
you have

269
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,150
you have depicted your side you getting
your passenger side new

270
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,880
you've created a certificate which
confirms that you are indeed either bob

271
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,070
or acting with bob's authorization

272
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,750
and that doesn't necessarily mean that
you can use

273
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,440
you can you can have this machine open a
portrait in New you can a ser use all

274
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,150
the privileges

275
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,150
love this resource similarly

276
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,250
resources cannot them resources

277
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,900
just because they are resources doesn't
necessarily mean that they are

278
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,300
authorized to return information to
dinner

279
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,600
the not necessarily the correct person
this

280
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,680
all very string or very a meticulously

281
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,410
done mutual authentication between all
the parties involved

282
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,130
as important to know will will come into
circumstances

283
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,470
we talk about the different what we talk
about a authorization

284
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,460
I went on a search on indications is
something to keep in mind

285
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,140
very different ideas and they work
together here

286
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,510
like where they work normal skins

287
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,770
the this certificate parties had is a
lot on the basis for that

288
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,079
that's on

289
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,529
basically in interned layers trust c/o

290
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:29,279
you tend to forget to get your pretty
good starting here for doing a lot of

291
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,000
other things

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,440
arm we got this

293
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,750
I had an example here also so outside I
mention

294
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,399
policy that way I mentioned on the idea
enterprise

295
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,450
level our computation sharing

296
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,070
even you doing something like Kyle is
that the business

297
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,810
electronic data interchange is raising I
could be enabled

298
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,399
reasonably buyers for towards Asians
don't think so ago

299
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,830
virtual private network or our internal
network or other ways

300
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,089
might side do it I'm just an example of
what could be one of these

301
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,010
hair oddness data flows so it's a have a
i

302
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:13,709
are you know database error that's doing
dislikes and then have a a supercomputer

303
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,370
this thing computational the graphics
machine that singer visualization

304
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,800
and have some storage back n thats
during the output in various

305
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,879
various ways well as very reasonable to
use again either

306
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,089
that many places are doing in the real
world because the software's

307
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,870
is problematic lot things are from by
the model is

308
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,530
a good model for having this whole verse
organization Jana

309
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,860
are processing happening and

310
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:45,040
thing that the grid computing is meant
to enable on

311
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,200
okay we talk about Bo's I talk about
stuff gets thank Asian

312
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,530
on mentioning years as a poor job was
saying that they're basically

313
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,899
when you're we talking about Tom
authentication

314
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,929
a lotta times the authorization
something

315
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:06,510
day D or severally also that the
language

316
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,590
is a little bit slippery your change
even be able to hear that people are

317
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,750
like writing this software they they
don't always use by the same terms

318
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,200
they had a single the service report
type and

319
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,360
and these actually have their own level
controls %uh like a system level

320
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,929
controller username

321
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,809
it's more like a essentially a service
level of control

322
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:30,010
arm but see

323
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,800
gonna mention things like file systems
and and so forth as a

324
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,309
and logging is a possible

325
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:44,550
element infrastructure

326
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,419
right on talk about globus little bit
already actually view some the changes

327
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,080
in Clovis

328
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,550
as poor chap said we we know that 40 is
coming

329
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,930
and we have to understand his version
one came out then version and people

330
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,720
development those coppers is never talks
and people were doing software

331
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,340
concept I'm actually a %ah coach Aaron
won the working group

332
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,740
in a global platform for Winfrey for
feels like doing reference

333
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,210
implementations and requirements
documents all that formal stuff

334
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,350
on at this there was I service in the
persian to sell

335
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,940
but so version 2 comes along everything
changes right version three came like

336
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,060
everything changes you like and when I
say everything I mean like does not your

337
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
code is going to work

338
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,590
anymore you'll be able to compile you
won't be able to run armed version 4 is

339
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,199
gonna be more

340
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,830
the same essentially the advantage is
moving from a

341
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,000
our environment with globe it's a sick
look over here

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,060
with Globus being this huge monstrous
package is still compiling

343
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,510
because it includes all this stuff which
is in many

344
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,030
cases not all cases replicating wat get
from

345
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,250
grid web services tom cat and and others

346
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,530
arm they're gonna be leaving a bunch
that stuff out

347
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,560
and sensually layering over on I'm

348
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,919
web services we have yet to see really
how that's gonna work by the the thing

349
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,280
that's going to be really cool about it

350
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,360
is gonna it should anyway shrink the
code base

351
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,680
considerably and it's going to be nice
Los law you do a lot of

352
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,800
very very interesting things arm it's
kinda hard to explain

353
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,909
our mister really into details

354
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,970
by the more more I look at Globus

355
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,210
the more more it seems to be made for
web services

356
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,940
another some playing for a while but
they really seem to go together very

357
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,480
well

358
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,010
home and it's really unfortunate that
every you basically have to burn

359
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,140
everything that you've done

360
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,470
in order to go from two to three in
three or four there are some

361
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,370
people I know disturbed use three the
2.4

362
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,480
territory hours before still will
probably be 2.4 for the next and then go

363
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,340
to jail for

364
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,300
them be a problem or true by in order to
maintain usability

365
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,410
you have to stay older versions this
gets into

366
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,920
going to be talking about a little bit
later one the biggest enemies

367
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,130
to to keep your systems up to date
securities

368
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,470
length of time stones yes it's like
using an old version of the operating

369
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,210
system kernel version of some
application software

370
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,680
that's a little supported you know
there's people using it but it's not

371
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,460
not world developers are paying
attention certainly just because you

372
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:15,960
don't have

373
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,380
400 hours to upgrade on my left eye

374
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,540
CLS the source do I reset the other
things but Tom

375
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,649
the idea here was there's a couple
papers on this night I had a citation

376
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,410
didn't find that the 1i was looking for

377
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,020
but essentially thousand lines code you
can have

378
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,700
statistically speaking a bother to you
in that house lines code and you never

379
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,580
do that by virtue in South lines code by
going in and

380
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,360
and testing basically and then you get

381
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,260
you cut that path so the hundred
thousand lights code you have a hundred

382
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,620
bucks and get down to fifty

383
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,870
it on flight five by doing revisions
right and

384
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,380
I I testing well says statistically

385
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,610
if you have a are highly complex

386
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,390
amount of code II you know lines goes on
Wake County about but a whole lot code a

387
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,310
lot complexity

388
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,580
statistically you got bugs right and you
can do revision after his nap revision

389
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,139
test after test after test

390
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,470
and statistically still got bucks and
again chances are some other sponsors

391
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,210
security-related

392
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,410
I one thing that's in there in their
favor actually link to this and not

393
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,600
posit this is good I'll check for a
upload

394
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,380
arm what things in their favor as missus
is written in Java

395
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,690
so job doesn't have I nearly the
problems

396
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,890
CRC plus plus with

397
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,450
a buffer overruns and allocated memory
alive officers

398
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:42,450
let's play some applications

399
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:46,950
actually I'm those were installation
instructions you had available very yeah

400
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,789
I don't I don't think that link works
but yeah

401
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:51,619
but it's interesting that you had a
great installation instructions because

402
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:52,889
I also had a reinstallation

403
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:56,070
junctions I put mine up on the web so to
help some people

404
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,320
I i mean i i created home I work for an

405
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,639
undisclosed education institution North

406
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:05,840
here and we had to

407
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,100
there there's a lot of documentation
globus

408
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,259
not all that go very we love it is
up-to-date on and

409
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,739
very little bit is coherent in that it
doesn't make sense when you read

410
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:20,669
lot to the different documentation has
ever use different words in the same

411
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:21,769
some people

412
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:25,210
have different versions work reality

413
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,200
is depending on which version Globes
milieu you noticed

414
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,600
it's it's a huge cluster

415
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,669
arm point I was getting too

416
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:40,119
is that since nobody really has any

417
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,009
great dog with the closest thing to a
great document I have ever seen you've

418
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:43,739
ever seen

419
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:47,649
but so IBM has a redbook gotta read
books and it's very calm

420
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:51,419
you can find is regrettable IBM back on

421
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:54,629
as River Oaks read books please read
books

422
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:57,739
America be redbook where arm

423
00:23:57,739 --> 00:24:02,019
that I B and a common you can go search
for com globus related stuff you should

424
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:03,499
come up with about six hits

425
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:07,539
entrepreneurs there's one that's 85
pages

426
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:12,059
1x jus and then there's a different
version of them

427
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,178
that's three hundred made whatever you
can find a lot of different left and

428
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:18,799
that's probably the best I condition
that's out there unfortunately when

429
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,759
you're teaching

430
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,119
a class or Russian mike is sporting a
class is being taught some miles

431
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:28,509
you can really give them 500 manual
expects

432
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,559
students to be able to actually get
through

433
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,720
me should be objections you its this is
really here

434
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,929
listings we do that anymore on

435
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:42,039
so I had to rewrite the documentation
into in

436
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,919
18-page version which for a

437
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,889
which was a step-by-step trying to
explain you know trying to give no to

438
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,239
what to do if this didn't work

439
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,639
on trying to explain this concept would
you really can't do that

440
00:24:54,639 --> 00:25:00,779
use arm if political reasons that and
get used in that the teacher wrote up a

441
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,559
two page for sure which was just

442
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,139
line type this

443
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:11,960
type that type just line up live type
this type that

444
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,789
its the point I'm trying to make yours
the documentation

445
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:20,820
for the usual level is absolutely or and
if you want to write this stuff you

446
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,450
pretty much

447
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,909
have to read correct me if I'm wrong
agreement read the source

448
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:28,039
on yeah and

449
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:33,549
say documentation get on the mailing
list yes or a follow-up on

450
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:38,620
on the mailing list how many questions
easier post today amid Ste

451
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,919
2240 on your answer I when I
statistically looked at in looked like a

452
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,600
formal analysis but I was looking for
answers my questions I always down my

453
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,350
questions

454
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,730
now my answer about one in five times
something I'd say twenty to thirty

455
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,120
percent

456
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,429
by the answer ya the mailing list the I
had a link in here that that

457
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,840
I think it's it's not quite right it's
you next october start or have

458
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,299
ww-p you the address

459
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,539
that so as yet and it's so they have
archives on missus clover site and

460
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,240
L oversight announce

461
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,600
and a bunch of the ones for the sub
provinces them Graham

462
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,049
for

463
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,559
thank each loves closed process by

464
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:27,428
now is everything arm so in a way that
but I mean we're

465
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:30,690
we're sticking with it because we see
some the promise and

466
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,760
arm everything is really exciting
technology mean that there's there's a

467
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,419
lot of there's a lot of really

468
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:43,120
worthwhile things that have been talked
about some those actually happened

469
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,539
pretty optimistic for the future

470
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:50,029
but job but boy you know it's a rough
ride arm

471
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:54,159
on talk about the terror dread II I
think I use it both way the camera

472
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,370
supper taste year lower case G antero
grid

473
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,309
on this was the I national science
foundation-funded

474
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:04,460
on effort to do so to the next
generation Internet things so so most

475
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,909
people know history the Internet in

476
00:27:05,909 --> 00:27:09,559
the middle eighties sf.net was the
network

477
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,750
which sorta was like darpa net

478
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,049
the earlier network an NSF not linked
the originally 5

479
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:20,370
National Science Foundation sponsored
supercomputing centers and CSA in San

480
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,720
Diego on Prince and so forth

481
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,899
arm I Pittsburgh and and car

482
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:33,899
actually so what do you do after you've
done that for a little while well first

483
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,230
you

484
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,480
in the early 2000's you modify the
internet so the answer

485
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,169
isn't running the internet anymore
anything we're going to the

486
00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:41,940
supercomputing

487
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,360
centers and won the answers was let's do
this next generation stuff lets you

488
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,019
really ultra high-speed networking

489
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:51,500
let's look at how we can share and like
medical puting across the centres

490
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,610
so is that a single the terror good the
terror great his

491
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,289
sorta overlapping with I different
places different people different

492
00:27:58,289 --> 00:27:59,010
projects

493
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,750
our globe is is part of this they said
they're using version 2.4

494
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,169
arm on some the big systems

495
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:10,269
and and their other project I think yeah
I have a couple links here some golden

496
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:11,830
pack International middleware

497
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,889
national middleware initial oliver
acronyms

498
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:18,510
are moderate amount love about software

499
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,799
not a whole lot sir standards activity
is more likely

500
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,480
were researchers were induced author and
do things and then

501
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,809
Bensalem turn into whatever product
standards

502
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,889
merge into existing services in general
researchers really like your

503
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:38,230
enough abouts these the earth what you
have to do in order to get there

504
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,909
stuff done they don't really care about
painting past you find others

505
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:47,440
the ground shaking grid there's is
there's this grid for

506
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,100
computing affects earthquakes on

507
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,730
structural structures and they call it
the a

508
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,080
a ground breaking up a ground chicken
application ok

509
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,019
so ever since but they're not that they
wrote their little application

510
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:07,789
and that's it there those people are
concerned about what happened Globes

511
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,750
they've had their bad experience in the
gun away

512
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,840
on the now reached in continuing I mean

513
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,330
is offers a broad generalization I don't
know these

514
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,360
earthquake people specifically but in
general all the

515
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,490
everyone this just interested in getting
their will

516
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,200
peaceable work done and by the time it's
over it's over

517
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,580
and that's true and several ways because
you want to grant monies

518
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,408
regret is done have a

519
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:39,460
was smothers here as well arm let's show
you just for a moment I have some

520
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,470
screenshots

521
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,720
so compiler that was entrance road like
those

522
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,370
like in 10 I S II you know I'm a
researcher at

523
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,460
University have a login on the terrorist
you some idea

524
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,220
free for 30 research so this is the arm

525
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,440
NCSA terror great this I think this is
actually mercury

526
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,409
which is lies somewhere in the top 10
top500 supercomputers

527
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,740
at the world in other words when the
world's fastest supercomputers

528
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,639
ranked in the top 10 arm its I believe
as i said i

529
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:14,750
II didn't I I mention and go back and
look up and see which this is actually

530
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,309
going to

531
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:18,760
probably this is a fifteen hundred no
del by 10 a.m. to system

532
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,639
National Center for supercomputing
applications intervention in Illinois

533
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:25,960
saw your name there and I just for
curiosity

534
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,590
I am I jus soli totally legitimate like
they were not

535
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,549
I had nothing to do with all attacking
arm

536
00:30:33,549 --> 00:30:37,340
but I just love these are some nice
numbers is just the idea

537
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,360
jealous the filesystems this is one down
here so I'm not the GA GPFS

538
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,220
switches short for general parallel file
system it's his way of doing

539
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,679
%ah basically a parallel data possibly
as a payroll data reading and writing

540
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:51,899
across budget differences

541
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:56,559
on some sort buser on says where they do
some scratch space this is a 23

542
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,399
terabyte are scratch try which size 13
terabytes are available

543
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:04,779
so most people haven't seen those sites
numbers in your local

544
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,879
I you know a laptop and stuff like that
with other

545
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:11,539
nice also on they have I is a year

546
00:31:11,539 --> 00:31:15,419
I did you name I say obviously they're
taking a variation on

547
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,909
sousa 1x doing doing a few different
things but it's a fairly

548
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:23,000
fairly vanilla operating system on

549
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,419
I said I Kenya to use a fairly vanilla

550
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:30,490
release or 64-bit systems that they're
building a sign

551
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,080
and then the the hard part as we
mentioned is

552
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,240
you know who knows how long how many
hours spent a when a hour to patch comes

553
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,629
out

554
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:41,669
you know when a new version of Clovis
comes out when Apache something like

555
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:42,740
open SSL this

556
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,230
make might be linked and other things on
your system comes out

557
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,970
and so the question is you're going to
apply that patch

558
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,779
on and risk breaking things

559
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:59,080
worry going to not apply that patch and
risk breaking things because a risk

560
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,000
being broken into

561
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,149
moms you

562
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:08,850
this is the other one so have justice
this this aims and the Mercury's as mad

563
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,090
as little on

564
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,369
program I use to do memory allocation
has weed is 64-bit programming

565
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:18,100
arm panoramic people experiencing issue
32 bit programming

566
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,929
are you know an int is four bytes and
you're done you know soon and as a range

567
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:25,950
on sign from 0 to 4 billion sign from
the United

568
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,769
like you don't you know this on a 64-bit
environment all the sudden have to look

569
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:31,510
at compiler switches

570
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,190
you have to look at whether using a long
long long occasionally

571
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,350
arm I double precision all the side to
things

572
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,720
and so all the sudden you go on one
system and you say how long is an

573
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,260
internet says you know a

574
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,179
are for my co-owners isn't a long
sentences eight bytes

575
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:51,289
and you don't necessarily know all the
time we getting as Jeep a little arm

576
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,789
program 10/9c program that does not
reallocation see how much memory can get

577
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,710
before craps out supply compile it and a
craps out at two gig

578
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:03,240
assuming I have like like get gigs
memory if if it does

579
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,580
stops running at you getting a memory
allocated then I say okay something

580
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,549
wrong because they should be getting
closer to four gig

581
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:12,950
writes like I'm using signed injures
rather unsigned integers

582
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,279
missile debugging techniques arm

583
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,809
I brute force I don't know our opponents
are called anything up to a close call

584
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:22,668
this is just call trial and error

585
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,960
you know space for the program runs
until it breaks and where breaks tells

586
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,600
me how much I was able to get

587
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,360
as I could be at a car and engine in
your car and you're driving until

588
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,260
until you can drive any faster you know
that you know you're your top speed

589
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,429
arm so ours the

590
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:42,600
arm 64-bit environment so they have 12
gig memory

591
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,220
I am scene with 64-bit you should be
alert to address with one program

592
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,399
essentially all that well

593
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:50,419
gig by this is 32 bit machine is the on

594
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:54,250
you know Athlone all that stuff then you
go really gonna be able access within

595
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,610
single address space

596
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:00,289
with a single program up to about
forgetting practice yoga quite that much

597
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:05,480
arm anyway my point is on the mercury
system I got da 17 terabytes

598
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,339
avram

599
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:14,339
and these are calyx is not Alex and and
Lexus and sometimes you do Amalek

600
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:17,668
and it says success and it turns out it
was exaggerating

601
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:21,949
with the with calyx actually 0 that the
memories are supposedly this is

602
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,908
trustworthy are not

603
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:26,020
not sure it may actually go back and and
try to write all those some

604
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,460
right all the spots near a arm

605
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:35,359
visit our grade I use our news this is
there a security incident

606
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,679
is on the web like I said no and I i
don't have any inside information

607
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,159
on actually have I actually keen we'll I
can share with you because that would be

608
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,770
unfair

609
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,369
to them fine folks at San Diego arm bite

610
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:50,849
this was an announcement that said I G
folks we're broken into in a pretty bad

611
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:51,399
way

612
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,540
and therefore all usernames not alienate
all passwords on Altera grid systems are

613
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,149
changed

614
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:00,460
on and by the way the systems are all
down

615
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,099
right now we figure out what's going on
and what we can do about it

616
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:10,619
and when some other systems came back up
I think it was

617
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,670
was the one I just had your back arm

618
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:17,299
when systems came back up one thing that
happened was I said

619
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:22,960
are I'll are rather than having a
username and you login via SSH

620
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,059
arm some some systems are going to
continue to let you login via SSH

621
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:32,170
other systems are gonna require Kerr
Bros other systems are required a set up

622
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,020
a certificate

623
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,430
and send us your %ah I additional six
can will do the signature net

624
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,279
in procedurally are we had I love key
signing I think you're procedurally

625
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,829
if you want to accept someone's hockey
you know in a

626
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:48,869
public key encryption system yes do it
right by

627
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:52,299
where you're supposed to do of course
you pick up the phone where you going to

628
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:56,099
meet them face to face the sale okay I
verified that this digital thing

629
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,450
matches some physical actual person as
they're actually doing that

630
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,450
in a terrorist you know I don't think
they're their sending around

631
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:06,049
people to visitors thing have to come
stop by our office San Diego or

632
00:36:06,049 --> 00:36:09,220
actors caltech this that way arm knows

633
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,099
on your on the phone brain which they
they they made big changes

634
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:20,099
there're thank a shin says and patience
is a monster

635
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,950
right let's talk about this security
stuff finally this is

636
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,450
this is fairly general stuff I we we do
now and it's it's

637
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,960
you know a secret how the terrorist
systems got broken into

638
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,230
released on great detail but by
basically was operating system

639
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,540
the underlying operating system %ah I
miss

640
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,910
computers add patches that had not been
addressed

641
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,080
and the main reason we suspect we don't
know for a fact

642
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,250
they were in dresses because basically
here

643
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,340
or because maybe labor costs by by doing
the upgrade

644
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,470
might have been more painful not doing
the upgrade

645
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,490
decision that or maybe images

646
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,750
maybe make decisions regardless back not
doing

647
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,369
backfire

648
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,130
alright so we are you talk about this
first point Fairmount actual first and

649
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,289
second point on

650
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:19,789
arco complexity means opportunity for
bugs the fact that you have to rebuild

651
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:20,809
from source

652
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:25,249
every time you have a problem and you
know the answer and get an answer to

653
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:26,789
those twenty or thirty percent from

654
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:29,499
over Sevilla for is often is is the
effect that well we are really

655
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:30,329
understand

656
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:32,880
you know we know that some kinda
relationship but we don't have a wave

657
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,859
really describe your relationship
between these different

658
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:38,369
packages they're using and the
underlying operating system and things

659
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:40,479
like that version a job that you're
using

660
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:45,419
and musings over arm this complexity
leads to

661
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:49,009
%ah are bugs as others by the scary lady
arm

662
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:52,289
rebuilding is painful I next-generation

663
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:55,630
judge doing transition to
next-generation is painful it also means

664
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,199
that there's your developers for the
older

665
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,029
versions %uh certificate servers aside
from the just

666
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:05,399
practical difficulties love doing what I
said noting its like call you up and

667
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:06,249
read digital

668
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:09,269
signature and find out if the person
that you know you have on the phone you

669
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:10,249
can really trust match

670
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:14,549
signature arm people like me to
installous to forget server

671
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:18,429
even on a test basis joins us to like a
little little many

672
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:22,319
insulation Grid software your own
testing yeah tell us if cancer

673
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:25,929
right and people botched certificate
servers all the time

674
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,649
this software for doing it is the the at
something different choices unless you

675
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:30,439
wanna pay money

676
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:34,249
to you one company that does it you're
stuck with some solutions that maybe

677
00:38:34,249 --> 00:38:34,579
aren't

678
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,479
ideal or maybe require lottery eating
were more critically

679
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:42,380
require insulation on a system which is
rock solid

680
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,639
secure so if your certificate servers
compromising

681
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:50,649
you loss right arm always wins as we
talk about

682
00:38:50,649 --> 00:38:53,828
and then you have a the whole the whole
area about occasions

683
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:57,329
I'm if I'm developing other Eric red
right you can run

684
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:00,609
essentially any system that any
programming that what under

685
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:03,749
under glow issues have to do the work
did Britain able

686
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:08,559
on well k so the developers and could
introduce

687
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,209
very safe have vulnerabilities maybe
maybe these would-be

688
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:15,999
arms or the relative local exploits
because people might need to come in

689
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:17,989
through the virtual organization and get
sorted

690
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:21,139
authorized to access particular service

691
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:24,289
but as that services week those
weaknesses could yield

692
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:30,649
knows why yeah maybe it and I'll service
maybe even a little serve a tunnel to a

693
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:37,549
local exploit and as i think is one the
one one the biggest ones

694
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:41,099
what some actually I meant to ask you
before what's what's this stupid server

695
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:41,889
that you're using

696
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:45,309
the other something that's closer to
production environment why have

697
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:48,409
you know it's not really production I
would not call it back talk like

698
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:52,119
system actually on arm my my systems are
um

699
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,380
alive got a whole bunch o just normal

700
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,199
pentium machines enforce home

701
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,920
ranging from 2.4 gig too

702
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,609
3 your cell they're probably fourteen
years old

703
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:10,609
those also thrown in the mix for good
measure

704
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:14,420
mainframe were two s 390 my VM

705
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,819
right now there for using a chief as you
990

706
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:23,509
specifically see 960 news

707
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,500
something different on putting all that
together

708
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,599
and making it work together

709
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,890
is some work harder than you might
expect and

710
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:39,069
are that is actually network access you
have to leave some ports open you have

711
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,779
to allow some things to get through

712
00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:44,289
and when you mainframe environment
people

713
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:47,930
Jude the same collision I mean that the
same some et cetera

714
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,098
so that's cause some interesting issues
our also

715
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,309
in the future linking up to other
schools other

716
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:57,819
institutions who want to do basically
the same thing and a

717
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:01,339
theories if you can get 10 small guys
kill you make one big

718
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:07,359
on and you had asked about specifically

719
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,109
City it sir we're using open SSL

720
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:14,529
I'll with really much the standard

721
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:18,789
CA to appeal writing same thing the
exact its

722
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:23,069
its this basic thing because they open a
selection I just a perl script

723
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:26,890
which does all the actions that is
delivery needs to do

724
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,129
so we just have one system or actually
it's a

725
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,440
virtual machine on the system most
abortions are act split up into a budget

726
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,180
missions

727
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:40,470
protesting purpurea testing environment
we all run any production quotas yet on

728
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:44,740
its divided up into

729
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,859
Sohrabuddin 26 machines are or more
there's budget five

730
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:52,470
5 machine genes which has been used for

731
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:59,200
class I mentioned earlier with that
stupid server you

732
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,930
near you collect only a research request
sign in distributing again there's going

733
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,410
to be some

734
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,810
interesting problems when we actually go
up with other institutions as to how

735
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,380
we're going to manage all that whether

736
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,800
our servers going to manage everybody's
certificates Korea we're just going

737
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,310
sorta figure out some way to

738
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,880
mutually trust each other servers and
allow things go

739
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,619
that way that brings up another
interesting point my daughter how many

740
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:23,030
have you

741
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,849
no I'll certificates work to expand I
works

742
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,700
arm there's an idea over X lot 509

743
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,050
X period its there's a

744
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,660
this idea CRL certificate revocation
list

745
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,000
when a certificate is no longer good
weather this machine that had it is

746
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,609
compromised or whether

747
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:48,069
did it's just not being used for any
reason

748
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:54,580
you the city name to a list certificates
which are no longer valid engine no

749
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,950
longer be trusted source only comes up
and says hey I'm this guy looking there

750
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,349
right

751
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:03,640
you look at the server cereal and find
out if they're listed so

752
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,859
com when the big problems here is that
globus

753
00:43:06,859 --> 00:43:10,569
until 3 to in support seals

754
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:15,480
so this this is giant glaring security

755
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,000
problem or issue serve arose out of

756
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,070
what's your pick up my server even

757
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,330
you can tear agreed I guess now I and II
didn't think about that for

758
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,880
but was yours cover my server room as
you

759
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,560
50 suede in zero support your own com

760
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,710
your son certificates are big

761
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,920
mean me yes there's

762
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,650
some you made me use them before for a
patch or something like that

763
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,950
it says a lot like that and also all the
stuff gets that your issuing

764
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:54,480
on their use to sign a civics are all
code signing certificates you're you're

765
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,000
stupid

766
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,920
home stupid that I personally have is
used to sign

767
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,970
protestant the proxy axe in my place to
allocate and deallocate

768
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,770
resources summer grid so that I don't
have to sit there and see

769
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,810
yes yes sry yes a different

770
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:14,730
entity which ones in your machine has to
do that for you so you're saying you

771
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,190
know this

772
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:19,660
is jerry's saying it home resources are
signing certificates all the times

773
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,420
tickets are sensitive it's a sensitive

774
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,589
it's as if it's I think you go six or
seven miles deep

775
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:27,779
for from the ca2+ deepest goes

776
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,500
XM well its its complex

777
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,220
if you didn't get that already globus is
complex

778
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,080
as we said the the idea that you're
running

779
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,650
basically people are running these its
servers maybe shouldn't be running

780
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:44,890
stupid service

781
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,660
on or maybe they're putting on a system
which really shouldn't have said its

782
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,770
server on it because that system is

783
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,770
no reverses a lot people login is always
a

784
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,119
6 and it's not it's not rocket science
we people

785
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,170
you just go to a check list somewhere
you know how to do these things properly

786
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,070
we might not have the resources might be
saying oh it's kinda christmas is around

787
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:03,760
Scott

788
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,650
research and courses I do things that
historically have resulted in

789
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:11,080
yes QWERTY bomb the terror is there
research

790
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,890
so it is our last couple minutes here

791
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:18,118
a lotta growth lot more grid computing
I've been going to the

792
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:21,349
globus other clothes world the bold
reform

793
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:24,510
commerce's for %ah last half-dozen or so

794
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,250
meetings they're all over the world
there they're pretty the commerce is La

795
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,359
to corporate interests

796
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,910
lot a corporate interests arm dollars
Sanders group

797
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,259
and software that's going on so it's
really very active that sets

798
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:42,440
party why this very real stuff and yet
to some extent third

799
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,839
poked at globe is a fair amount on the
site is really only piece but some

800
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:47,710
extent is

801
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:53,070
castle built on Sat writes a very
problem at the foundation software

802
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,310
for doing all this stuff is really like
to do in some cases can do

803
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:03,310
with great computing is up

804
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,030
standards moving towards bifurcation I

805
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,520
diversification looking at like

806
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,910
no try to get this offer embedded
systems and so forth

807
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,310
arm and I continued fragility because

808
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,420
all these changes because of all the
Lacko

809
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,730
like said a regression tasks of princely
you get if you install software

810
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,000
okay you runs on Linux kernel it's
alright and that the

811
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,580
2.6 course the upgrade its the only need
to watch all it's up to you need to make

812
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,509
death anymore

813
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,040
Wow that was an improvement so with
Globus

814
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,550
they don't even know dependencies right
so you need to

815
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,850
recompile and you acting as like I'm a
clean recompile almost every time

816
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,960
as I as we're seeing 61 on simple
recommendations

817
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,710
a that you're pretty common sense I
think Asian

818
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,420
the the notion of what whether your
systems with these

819
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,480
potentially bridal services are exposed
to the outside world

820
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,390
are the notion that you have to be
nimble and just say okay there's a

821
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:08,850
whatever's a new open SSL is gonna have
to go back in

822
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:12,130
rebuild the whole buncha stuff and maybe
follow good practices

823
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:16,160
you know development system ever
production tax system

824
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,339
there's an interesting problem really is
situation over this is all having to

825
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,270
recompile everything

826
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,070
open SSL

827
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:25,730
whatever current is hi verses where the
gurneys

828
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,680
the whatever degree is by specifies

829
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,720
on email address as locus the capital am

830
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,540
here L equals whatever arm

831
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,670
same thing your case the

832
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,030
year specifies capital email

833
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,380
couple a dress Eagles and that just that
little tiny difference between if you

834
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,200
have a different version

835
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,600
years CA versus a different version on
your looks klein's

836
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,730
you're gonna pro little things like that
little

837
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:01,310
missiles sits immensely complex think
about Dom

838
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:07,000
120 analogies alike camera position I
ran out here

839
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,520
last thirties forty seconds here but to
was thinking about complexity

840
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,870
leading to you being able to test right
so you have a Boeing 747 with six

841
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,830
million parts

842
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:21,509
on and something's going wrong in this
area the plane is okay let's look at

843
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:22,770
what connects air inlets

844
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,400
does gonna focus on Apr a plane with
software usually don't have that luxury

845
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,230
rights have gather up packaged with cora
million lines of code

846
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:36,090
in I you know eighty-year nineties
independently developed sub packages

847
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:39,020
remember bill together and you have
problems you don't even know where to

848
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:39,570
start

849
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:43,410
a lot of times yes our mailing list
against you in the know nor start with

850
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:47,250
are trying to trying to fix those errors
and that's really

851
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:52,970
com no problem that that against it is
sickly historically by best practices in

852
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:53,800
software development

853
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,680
you can't get around you know the only
thing you can do is Cassie at every

854
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,419
Russian test

855
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:01,870
you know us we dove I you know tests

856
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,509
both for the general installation also
your own particular applications

857
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:10,700
that confidence as lower know any
closing thoughts I think we're in the

858
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:13,060
last few seconds here

859
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,290
not ready for prime time but soon YES on
the bill executable absolutely exactly

860
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:20,560
yeah on and and and we're I mean we see
promise

861
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,049
wi-fi see promise I will be happy get
email on talking about this

862
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:28,790
later through I'm sorry ran out time
guys like I really question period

863
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:33,369
today by to okay we have one question
okay large

864
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:37,160
are globus .org is a place for Globus
Toolkit on

865
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,529
had a link to ID new territory da door

866
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:44,430
for the national there are great on and
packy .org

867
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:48,580
is the the place E forget I go to tear
down organic and link to the other

868
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,130
places

869
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:53,290
and globus or GF pushed Global Grid
Forum at places are doing these

870
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,080
standards

871
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,609
that I talked about so terribly .org for
the NCSA and so forth

872
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:01,990
I talked about which is one
implementation basically possible

873
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:06,090
much other things and then GGF .org
lowest artwork

874
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:10,130
mailing to each other which is close to
locate and the standards fell

875
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:13,140
okay then wrap it up thanks and I'm

876
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:20,140
have fun with the grid the slights

877
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,880
yup

878
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,650
up

879
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,720
up

880
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,040
up

881
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:35,290
up
