1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,359
I'm in my lecture

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:07,620
going to be comparing the barbarians

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,750
in the Roman Empire to

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,160
actors in modern imperialist I don't
have any projections

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,000
wants to make world

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,360
that's right you

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,520
and just really want to say it's kinda
funny that my big brother

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,730
exactly like this again sir

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,430
okay anyway okay well my whole thesis
statement was

10
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,950
then the time their own empire they
controlled basically what was known as

11
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,320
West

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,059
time the barbarians

13
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:53,480
enemies say they're savages

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,080
on the outskirts balding

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,239
terrible people he did so much

16
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,060
today United States

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,290
trying to

18
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:12,420
make themselves Center in

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,880
making their own type structure

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,880
culture in day there now

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,009
you can bring in new enemy which can
actually be compared which are

22
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,790
hack back I can actually

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,250
going to actually make this comparison I
just wanna talk

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,090
a about history and cyclical nature

25
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,680
by the possible cyclical nature history
so if I'm actually

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,360
make comparisons you know something that
happened you know

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,500
over a thousand years ago something's
happening today

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,310
is kinda important take a look at
history

29
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,770
and time in general now if you really

30
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,570
taker if you think about history and you
think the nature

31
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,570
history is removed time right so

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,050
you know without time there is no
history the reason how

33
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,120
its as humans can recognize anything

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,780
historical is by no looking back in time

35
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,300
so history in time are running
completely parallel

36
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,849
in that sense really I mean

37
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,149
since times continue its time doesn't
stop

38
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,819
you know then how can history be

39
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:34,879
cyclical if it's para never stop
continuously moves

40
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,078
Acme say histories a cyclical thing

41
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:43,319
I'm sure everyone's heard expression his
resume repeat itself something

42
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,680
you have but if you have been

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,450
you know what i'm saying its not too
difficult actually

44
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,510
are you against that respected history
never really

45
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,179
does stop so hot backing and actually
repeat

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,739
but if you really

47
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,439
you know you take a look at at history
now what

48
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,400
ways history history is I'll what we
remember

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,969
I'll generations that societies

50
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:17,529
that if we take a look at humans where'd
humans come from

51
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:24,420
I mean no matter what

52
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:31,190
I'm and over the last

53
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,730
weaver you know adapted to our
surroundings

54
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,560
and even gone so far to our surroundings
actually adapt to us

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,900
home you know in the beginning when
people were

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,340
being in it in a stadium nature you know
we had to

57
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,030
or you know the humanity had actually
you know conform

58
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,459
conform to nature conform to your
surroundings eventually

59
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,680
ultimately Tom people began you know
banding together creating societies

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,970
group of people working together a and
you know these groups

61
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,910
really um as we're going to see later
somewhat

62
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,870
almost stopped the physical evolution

63
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,950
love humanity as being adaptable

64
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,349
towards me so for example we have to go
out and hunt anymore

65
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,610
an app to go out and kill anybody you
know the law altogether

66
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,070
for me you know if if I really into your
so I'm

67
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,610
II you know in that sense we've created
these societies in these groups

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,600
that help you know bring everybody
together govern everything

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,970
Tom and even though they've some would
stop the physical evolution no

70
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,220
know the species interestingly enough by

71
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,610
by living inside the Society member I
conforming to

72
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,750
the bounds that we've created were
actually now

73
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,970
evolving with then the bounds love

74
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,040
our society and some you know since as
we do that

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,790
as society's following collapse history
does

76
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,810
in you know tend to actually repeat
itself arm

77
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,270
so even though it is a

78
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,419
a complete continuum and actually never
does stop

79
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,620
you can't denied the the cyclical nature
of biology

80
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,200
I know the evolution and Nov you know
all that good scientific stuff like that

81
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,150
and so therefore since

82
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,330
you know even though the history and
society are running parallel to time

83
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,349
because they're ultimately based

84
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,570
a natural principles they do tend to

85
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,280
cycle back or at least they definitely
give perception

86
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,310
cycling back and and repeating
themselves

87
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,240
and you know history does tend to repeat
itself

88
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,020
a from

89
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,210
a

90
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,909
even though we're we're living in a
society where

91
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,120
a people are actually you know working
together

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,410
trying to diversify our towns to work is

93
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,160
one whole arm the the nature of self
love you know love the cell

94
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,450
its comes back you know throughout the
ages

95
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,789
in the romantic period love the self

96
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,610
I mean knowing he really deny the fact
that ultimately

97
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,720
know everyone has a little bit
selfishness I mean you have to think

98
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,540
yourself at some point right you

99
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,900
ultimately have to do things for
yourself to survive arm

100
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,690
this tends to man its manifest itself
more

101
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,150
in some people than in others I A

102
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,640
you know for example someone who gets

103
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,300
a you know extremely selfish and greedy
with any kind of control or power

104
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,570
they're gonna want to get to the top me
once dated you know anyone else out

105
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:53,979
there

106
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,630
to try and keep you know keep everyone
else damn

107
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,450
need them in that respect in a in a
society where

108
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,710
you know control is necessary to keep
everyone within these bands

109
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,940
to keep them from escaping into the
state in nature and to keep them inside

110
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,020
you know this

111
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,580
the sack inside this arm you know world
that we create to make us

112
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,280
you know for whatever reasons to make
everyone saver whatever

113
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,229
arm the self-love

114
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:26,780
you know and love the self needs

115
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,130
I mean it needs to be dis discouraged a
larger level

116
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:34,909
you know in people I mean okay with me
up here talking blah blah blah

117
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,000
right I'm talkin you know but but I'm

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,880
home you know all the people here at
this conference that come up here and

119
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,240
talk to me these prior life topics that
are discouraged in general you know that

120
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,760
people don't exactly

121
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,360
your though powers-that-be don't exactly
why I'm

122
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,700
alive these topics out in and 'em you
know

123
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,830
I mean for their own obvious reasons the
need

124
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,960
to press those types desires to further
their own

125
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,800
and in that respect um

126
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,430
right self loves important but
unfortunately

127
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,960
tends to be extremely denied never take
a look at the actual Roman Empire

128
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,880
okay they had is extensive said manners
are they called manners you know it's a

129
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,400
go

130
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,470
okay I'm a Roman you know yeah I don't
go out and do

131
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,570
stellar get my hands dirty a room in a
Asus

132
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,929
yeah I got the army to protect me I got
no food whenever I wanna from the

133
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,700
granaries I got all the corner i won

134
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,930
in all this good stuff um so

135
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,110
you know that really ended up almost

136
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,650
Tom you know

137
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,260
deal involving in a way the barbarians
to the Roman people

138
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,420
were perceived as extremely ugly

139
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,420
hideous creatures very Ross aged

140
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,979
horrible mean terrible people and um

141
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,610
you the reason I mean to to actually per
trade them

142
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:13,430
as such as savages or even as subhumans
like these destructive people to live on

143
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,570
the fringes

144
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,870
society you know they're perfect world

145
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,640
arm you know by criminalizing these
people

146
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,410
you know you're creating a a negative
pole

147
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,209
for all the citizens to actually you
know kinda revolt against

148
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:32,640
and shape themselves in respect to the

149
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,010
opposite 0 what is negative for this is
a

150
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,449
are negative for the culture and 'em

151
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:42,660
so you know the board the programs from
you after

152
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,490
at the time they were big and scary but
being portrayed as such

153
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,530
really helps bomb

154
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,650
keep the the masses under control by

155
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,670
not wanting to be like these horrible
people um

156
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,829
in today's culture interesting a look
lookout

157
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:02,040
the hackers portrayed you know
throughout

158
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,209
everything I mean you got like you know
skinny

159
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,140
nearly key were broken glasses goes
pants at the year

160
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,890
you know not agree with the ladies he's
really smart okay

161
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,780
given that alright smart guy knows
appears that but

162
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,890
you know don't know if I really wanna be
like that

163
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,240
unknowingly but you know sure

164
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,320
not is not all trip but it's how it's
portrayed

165
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,360
right and so then you have the good
citizens

166
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,650
over ever you know seeing this negative
image

167
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,430
and you know schoenberg's funny
sometimes it's whatever

168
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,270
but I am at the same time its that
negative pole

169
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,550
the negative pole that you know people
don't wanna be like you know

170
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,190
a compliment respect and therefore

171
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,350
you know by giving these negative images
arm

172
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,060
you know it he tries to keep that you
know the self

173
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,449
identity I'll these people on the you
know the fringes than

174
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:04,900
maybe not accepting everything that
they're fed

175
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,040
by leaders you know it keeps them in a
negative light

176
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,449
it gives a you know base port rail

177
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:14,570
for other people too you know

178
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,339
oppose themselves to and home

179
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:22,079
you know just I mean overall it

180
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,480
may even play upon the consciousness I
love

181
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,490
those people the name making them feel
better about themselves

182
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,260
thing up yeah some people may you know
except the image

183
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,490
I've broken glasses but

184
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,530
so are I would actually take a look

185
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,449
you-know-who who were the barbarians
what are by bands

186
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:49,610
Lorenzo I am the barbarians were like I
said you know they're from

187
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,540
well if you take a look at the the
Western Roman Empire you had a

188
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,069
the Germanic tribes Northern Europe
right the Goss the Vandals

189
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,270
a ultimately were the ones that came
down to like our own damn damn damn

190
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,699
takes does that however you know a.m.

191
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,050
a long time before that Roman Empire
actually split up into two

192
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,190
different implies did Western Empire
which is based in Rome

193
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,089
you know Italy your seven you had the
Eastern Empire which is based in

194
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,839
constant know your base in turkey

195
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,160
much of asia the European barbarians
overthrew the Western

196
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Roman em- the Western Roman Empire

197
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,439
long before the Eastern Empire was
destroyed

198
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,650
you know after another barbarians

199
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:42,270
a eventually you know couldn't take to
control the Romans anymore

200
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,390
which are touch more on in a minute and
eventually all tingly

201
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,730
you know killed by Jerome to go for
themselves

202
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,890
and avenge the same thing happened long
time later but in the Eastern Empire as

203
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,480
well

204
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,990
basic on Sentinel based in turkey

205
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,589
I am the Eastern Empire ended up

206
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:05,790
staying in power much longer and
ultimately actually even went through

207
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,780
and

208
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,480
you know beat up love the barbarians
that had settled in Africa and Italy

209
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,550
and went through in took over most their
empire again

210
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,939
and ultimately were overthrown by the
Asian buyback

211
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:22,260
drives am

212
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,449
those

213
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,699
where the barbarians there from you know
Asia Northern Europe

214
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,359
basically people that were closer you
know closer to

215
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:34,649
mom teenager they value their freedom or

216
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,929
and you know they didn't really
appreciate the Roman control

217
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:42,970
ultimately it played against the Romans

218
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,459
I've we take a look at how your control

219
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:50,289
why why would the barbarians ripple why
would they do this

220
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,879
what happened what went wrong runs you
know they had this great

221
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,759
civilization they built roads everywhere
you know they build cool buildings net

222
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,149
rocks and stones are going to get stuff
but I am

223
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:06,739
a if you think

224
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:11,929
about control and controlling a people
right control in general me as a whole

225
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:13,728
bunch different ways you can control
people

226
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:17,059
right now you're listening to me but
yeah I'm not

227
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:20,589
tell you what to do I'm not controlling
you annie is the it's the environment

228
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:21,019
we're in

229
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,220
environment wherein you know you sending
their listening to what people are

230
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,970
telling yawning

231
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,549
are you know you just listening in and
weighing in reasoning

232
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:32,569
yourself um in

233
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:36,429
the Roman Empire their control their
people you know that go along with being

234
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:39,079
organized armies and so written by
people on the head

235
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,350
I correct back we're taking you up and
not get twenty guys with swords run in

236
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,449
your house and you re

237
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:48,809
day %uh alright whatever fun do job day
my mind here

238
00:14:48,809 --> 00:14:52,350
what you know they would stay and
eventually know the people

239
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,479
i mean they had to accept this they had
you're basically they had no choice

240
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,659
because they were you know imposed upon

241
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:02,889
with the physical control if a guy likes
alright

242
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,899
gillam beat him up job somewhere
whatever it takes

243
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:09,399
I'm that's probably the most obvious you
know

244
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,970
form love controlling

245
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,089
any no physical force I mean it's so
obvious in the pack

246
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:21,099
right like its own comes up to your
punches in the face

247
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:24,239

something like that I mean it it's not

253
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:42,189
only

254
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:46,238
completely obvious and blame but
physical harm

255
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:49,859
is not cool I mean no one likes like if
I hurt myself

256

bob me with us or something

258
00:15:56,609 --> 00:16:00,879
I'm would you do it you know so
ultimately people

259
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,209
resent this any type I mean today

260
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:08,459
today was the easiest IPO's old

261
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:12,159
love societies leadership to revolt
against the people

262
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,429
you know the leaders in countries the
torture their people or do our will

263
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,858
things are you know genocide massacres
knowledge that you see that like hold

264
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:21,579
sacred

265
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:25,839
you can't do that that's not cool arm
right it's not cool

266
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,029
a so you know if you think about it

267
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,299
arm info leaders gonna stay in control

268
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,759
right and they were really really really
smart about it they know they can't just

269
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,739
go beat you up

270
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:41,799
they know they can just go pound on US
air you know as Mina

271
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:44,989
yea my listen to it for a little while
but eventually

272
00:16:44,989 --> 00:16:48,209
you know you might go the gym and work
out every day and go beat them up re

273
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:50,909
Michel a president like you know we
don't get beat up the morning go beat

274
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:51,350
them up

275
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,479
you know which is ultimately when I'm
with the barbarians they wanted their

276
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:55,959
freedom

277
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,749
and when a bunch over you know Roma
people come in and say okay

278
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:03,470
against a prominent okay you're gonna
pay his taxes okay you gonna do it we

279
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:03,829
say

280
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:07,439
you after while they're like what

281
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,939
we spoke German before we didn't have
any problems

282
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,470
we didn't happen failed day

283
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,980
their banners sup you know I'm after a
while

284
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,720
the resentment became so strong that the
barbarians iraq dated

285
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,250
right taking this anymore and I mean

286
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,629
history they went in and they to grow
into

287
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:35,580
need to go related to go track record
eventually you know the 100 act ager

288
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,730
they are repelled but all the other
Asian drives with a cat attack and

289
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,740
attacking for years

290
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,919
until finally the tears came in brought
these are Roman Empire down

291
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:50,629
an out that was the end that was the end
the room if we take a look at

292
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:55,539
society today the principles haven't
changed its

293
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:59,139
you have to impose some type of med up
control

294
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:03,070
over people yeah alright most people
want to work together cuz I wanna be

295
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,039
comfortable

296
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,200
you know it's nice have been good stuff
like

297
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,629
if you have like it a hot tub so that's
cool man I like having a hot tub by the

298
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:12,769
way that would have allowed to

299
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:15,879
right I get bitten by bugs all the time
who wants that

300
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:19,960
at them look for my own food so it can
be to go to go to Starbucks

301
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,210
you know so you you know the benefit
society and culture

302
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,369
they're great you know there's all kinds
a good stuff that happens all the time

303
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:31,019
but you know there's always you know
there's always

304
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,309
arm all tear your mods I mean to people

305
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,649
don't you know ultimately probably

306
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:41,049
maybe our people go into politics

307
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,750
go into professional leadership roles
thinking okay

308
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,210
you know I'm a me too good you know I
wanted

309
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,080
do right for the people I wanna do it
right you know I've I feel bad

310
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,760
okay good example like okay taxes
elastic tax cut we had

311
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,419
mostly affected rich your upper-class
people amid

312
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,850
alarming so okay what about the people
that don't make a lot of money

313
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,899
like a pilot in my own taxes I I didn't
really get a tax guy again my back

314
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:13,570
as I think I you know everyone sorry for
this task around get

315
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,740
you know what pettit I'm gonna speak for
the people I'm gonna get up there

316
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,980
amina run for office and again of -ism
make things right for a replacement unit

317
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,010
again office

318
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,789
there's some guy consortium he's like I

319
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:32,169
giving million dollars is Nick sneakers
into a bill is something I Garneau

320
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:36,879
now you know when you go home in like
you know actually that million dollars

321
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:40,149
sounds pretty good in all to believe in
people that mean well

322
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,570
may succumb to corruption other facets

323
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,580
you know bad things so you know

324
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,609
I mean and then you have the people have
ulterior motives to go into it in the

325
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:52,460
first place

326
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,889
%uh your into professional leadership
because we're at a point

327
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:58,980
in our society where leaders are
professional

328
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,129
leaders I mean that's what they do for a
living you know it's

329
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:06,169
you know they don't go home and year ago
the office

330
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:11,419
and yeah their friends are of partitions
did leaders in the country so

331
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:15,470
ultimately you know they become out of
touch with

332
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,929
the people they represent not in our
cases but in a lot of kids

333
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:23,100
I am so if you actually take alarming so

334
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,779
they have to think about how to keep
their society under control how to keep

335
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:27,529
them

336
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:31,080
all in one United uniform

337
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,529
unit where people are going to stand up
and be like

338
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:38,289
taxes or a a decir hey that so they have
to

339
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:42,109
and they know they can go beat you up so
had to think up some

340
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:45,908
some different types of controls and
different way to actually keep people

341
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:49,039
listening and paying taxes and

342
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,899
you know keeping them in power nozzle a
good stuff I'm

343
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:56,100
so

344
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,440
step in a not got much

345
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,280
in him

346
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,610
mind control information control

347
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,650
you take a look at my control a good
example my control

348
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,130
%uh Arab we have many scientologist here

349
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,380
but scientology if you actually take a
look at how it works

350
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,770
um day use mind control

351
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,629
my control tactics to convince people to

352
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:31,640
you know sign up to their religion or
their beliefs or whatever

353
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,690
and not you know Scientology is just i
mean there's all kinds a different

354
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,220
little

355
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,290
sects and cults and stuff that use these
tactics if it's breaking down again

356
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,190
they're actually

357
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,590
extremely simple I mean

358
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,820
you you could just find someone who's
maybe not that happy

359
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,960
dream into a room so much movie's
heroine there be like

360
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,190
yeah

361
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,980
everything's great happy here in this
land our land everything is great and

362
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,470
the only feed you the information

363
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,330
they want you to know and ultimately you
base your decisions

364
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,649
on the information that's given you Tom

365
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,230
a good example is a yeah a

366
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,070
a well you know making

367
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,529
making decisions you know if if for
example you wanna

368
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:20,679
you don't know what kinda computer to
buy right

369
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:23,840
and you go when you read these reviews
on these two two machines

370
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,830
and one has all glowing reviews it does
all the great stuff about an area known

371
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,408
tell y'all

372
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,460
bad stuff all the negative stuff well
everything has a good in bed

373
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,620
really had a good side one thing and
yelling at the bedside

374
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,690
yet thing unfortunate enter favor

375
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,899
decided sounds good to buy controlling
that

376
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:45,740
attacked information by controlling all
the you know stuff that you actually

377
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,929
listen to in here

378
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:50,600
up you're going you're going to base
your decisions

379
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,159
on what you perceive as fair judgment
but

380
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:58,260
it's really maybe not the entire story

381
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,779
um so if you take a look at you know
something like that you know

382
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:06,559
when Colts where they take you out
tonight sry tree and everyone

383
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,389
is friendly and happy in your thing goes
down the certain

384
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,649
Road if we take a look at the American

385
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:18,010
society a you grow up and you see in
News

386
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,899
any news per half hour they say
everything goes on the world gay

387
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:26,830
lot people the world really can't hear
on half an hour

388
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,710
so I mean what what kind information
we're getting at regain the information

389
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,960
that

390
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,289
they wanna tell they wanna tell you
referees

391
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:37,779
would be it you know marketing
commercial dollars

392
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:42,460
or maybe some other gender whatever but
by only hearing these

393
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,220
parts of the story or parts at the news
and you know reading newspapers know

394
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,700
you're getting a part of the story

395
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,490
ultimately people this is the country
led down a single path

396
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,240
you know a single a way of thinking

397
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,809
and all your decisions the you
ultimately base

398
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:04,460
not just on world views but ultimately
these types of opinions

399
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,960
are gonna permeate their way into your
everyday decisions

400
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,240
arm I for example if you're constantly

401
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,390
you know a if your body adapts or if
your mind starts to adapt

402
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,520
you're just as a body with adapters to
some kind of physical stress or

403
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,629
something like that your mind ultimately

404
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,830
is going to start to adapt to arm the
directions

405
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,939
that there they're pointing me towards
mom

406
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,030
and those decisions you're gonna make
are going to

407
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,149
affect you know your everyday life
family life all this stuff because

408
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:45,299
your mind is going to begin to adapt
your let information is a given on

409
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:49,070
n and kisses in in the Roman Empire

410
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,270
as the Romans were a the Roman people
they didn't really have

411
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,600
you know to worry about but I didn't
have to worry about buying food or

412
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,020
anything like that um

413
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,460
you know ultimately their bodies became
weak

414
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,240
n week over generation after generation
ended you know the

415
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,080
its other you a physical principle up
survival of the fittest is

416
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,639
you know it pretty much went away arm
and it you know

417
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,000
okay where it's not non now there's only
a bad thing you know as long as

418
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,470
everyone's happy at the school

419
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,880
that's cool but because they impose a
fizzle control over people

420
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,740
when they're people became weak the
physically stronger able to knock them

421
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,230
down

422
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,330
and complete a comma I'm so if you take
a look at the control imposed today

423
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,789
over people your mind its it's a

424
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:40,520
its it's a almost as a conduit it is his
control

425
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,620
you know biking and if you take a step
back and look at it

426
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,679
I mean it's almost saudis it's so easy
to get away from emunim

427
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,700
you just take a look at the information
if you can just see all the information

428
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,970
instead of just

429
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,870
a little party then you can make you
know decisions that

430
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,289
are would be more inclined to you to be
fair

431
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:02,908
then the decisions that the people
giving you the information

432
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,799
think our fair Amin in that case

433
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,220
I would I'm it would it would be
probably

434
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,700
no more apt to more fair and balanced

435
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,090
have decided that way however I mean
people in power

436
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,399
maybe no I take that risk you know
there's a free with information you can

437
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:26,880
by mister I'm a good example is a few
take the

438
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,600
latest Michael Moore film Fahrenheit
9/11 I saw a movie

439
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,899
I said but are you know all this stuff

440
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:37,760
because I i you know I stay up on all
the world news I listen alternate

441
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,200
sources

news I know so many people it's only
count like

443
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,700

exacting troll

00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,059
mission people in in power they give you
the story they want you to know

448
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:03,428
and you don't end up getting the entire
story in just as the Romans evolve

449
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:07,539

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,760
and and they feel like you know they're
3

464
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,100
in that respect which okay

465
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,190
I mean if they're happy call but at the
same time

466
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,669
I mean if you if you take a look at you
know in the Roman Empire

467
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:06,789
I am you know genius

468
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:11,270
if you look at genius arm when when a
group of people accountable

469
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,389
in don't no it kinda

470
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:18,309
almost dole's the mine dole's the spear
does the body

471
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:22,720
you don't have to actually come up with
arm

472
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,940
any kind of you know new revolutionary
ideas you have to worry about

473
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,980
how we're gonna feed everybody I'll come
up with a great idea to build this giant

474
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,879
machine that makes corning's send

475
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:35,639
yeah but you have to think about that um

476
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:38,870
Anna and you know

477
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:44,840
a in that respect um

478
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,750
people ultimately if if this type

479
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,450
mind control in society continues
ultimately

480
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,510
I mean just as the bromance physically
degraded

481
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,020
the American Society is going to

482
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,230
mentally degrade in the same exact way

483
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,010
therefore because other um you know
implements have control

484
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:11,510
the instruments and control that are
used

485
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,389
then you have arm basically a

486
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:19,610
repeat history in a theoretical sense
yeah is not the exact same thing

487
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,690
but in principle in its I am

488
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,030
but then if you take you take a look at
it

489
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:32,168
you know people who who who do look at
all the information

490
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:36,500
you know people who can get into these
information sources you can manipulate

491
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,820
who can actually mess with the system
and you know kinda shake them up a

492
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,149
little bit is there not

493
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:44,379
totally handle everything you know visa

494
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:49,080
these the people that just as the
barbarians were scary the Roman these

495
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,039
are people that are scary to

496
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,730
you know the americans today damn
America

497
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,789
but a yeah I mean visa

498
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:01,169
the the people on the outskirts the
people who another

499
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:05,350
the people in power don't want them so
much you know

500
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,760
involved in all this stuff a just as

501
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,629
actually went you know the wrong people
became so weak that they no longer form

502
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:13,970
their armies with armies

503
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,700
became week where they would marshal
David like a a

504
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,909
is Armour's to have the we have to wear
it

505
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:24,039
and they're like yeah you're right it is
heavy take it off

506
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:27,510
there are many swords are heavy we don't
want them

507
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,330
they had daggers instead and so then she
the army degraded because the

508
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,330
they didn't have to fight you know so
they they became they

509
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,609
just like the people they became weak so
what the Romans do

510
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:40,429
they hired the barbarians in their arms
to the barbarians are still really

511
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:41,220
struck

512
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,320
you know mercenary armies in all this
other stuff

513
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,820
okay haha you know if your gonna hire
the people that don't like you and your

514
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,918
army

515
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,399
here ultimately that militants are good
for the meeting

516
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,690
but I mean ultimately if you look at the
phone company the phone companies

517
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,520
when you know the Breakers came in and
started messing with the phones

518
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,690
who they hire the free kicks they hired

519
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,359
to make their security strong and today
when you look at security

520
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:11,700
a lot of security people who they hire
when the network sir

521
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,270
you know in danger whatever day look to
hire hackers

522
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,770
arm is this so much the same exact
principal like up it's almost like a

523
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,350
mercenary army people

524
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,950
the know the ins and outs this is me
know how to bring it down so who better

525
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,119
to defend

526
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,220
right um but it was ultimately the you
know the

527
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,100
the barbarians that you know ended up
staying staying back

528
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,980
knew they weren't happily accepted it
didn't go in and help the roundout the

529
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,010
ended up

530
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,049
going on doing what they did I am

531
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:44,168
and so if you take a look I mean

532
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:47,200
at the the advantages I mean obviously

533
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,730
I mean I i recover I think all the
advantages I'll barbarians

534
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,119
and hackers as long as as long as
they're

535
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,350
is and organize society as long as
there's an

536
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:01,190
you know organized group of people
working together arm

537
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,040
ultimately their they'll have to I mean
they have to impose

538
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,109
you know as as the thirst for power
grows

539
00:32:10,109 --> 00:32:14,399
as a thirst for power rose

540
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,429
the people in power have to learn how to
control

541
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:22,100
masses people is you know people are
different everyone's different

542
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,379
I don't think I'm exactly like anyone in
this room these

543
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:28,770
brazier I'm not as anyone who looks
exactly the same you know do you know

544
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,520
anyone is exactly like someone else

545
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,129
I've brothers they're twins and they're
totally different they're identical

546
00:32:33,129 --> 00:32:33,600
twins

547
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,379
and there's a identical twins are
genetically and you know um

548
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:40,450
you know and then you take a group of
people near a group of people are going

549
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,220
to be different

550
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,309
you know if I take all the people that
live in New York City

551
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:48,309
okay New York City's example very much
upon okay if I go out to Long Island

552
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:53,010
okay I'm from schorr in Lima world and
got a nuclear power plant

553
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:56,408
them and if if some if I take

554
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:59,600
all the people in that town Nuit de
community people

555
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,109
and I go to like I am

556
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:06,850
Florida somewhere some little town in
Florida

557
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,700
these people are gonna be completely
different in fact you pry when the other

558
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,030
drug many similarities between

559
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,158
any one person in each place unless they
came from there

560
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,950
or a similar region and you know because
I've that

561
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,750
I mean which if you think governor
localize

562
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,260
government control people tend to be
more happy small group

563
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,429
where small groups can help you know
shape

564
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:34,210
their little environment and when you
take something as massive

565
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,320
as a country that's humongous with

566
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,840
millions of people in it um its it's
impossible to please everybody

567
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,129
right and a it

568
00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:48,379
however being the people in power you
have to keep them

569
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:52,419
all under wraps every single one of them
no matter how different they all are

570
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:55,460
and because of that then subversive

571
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,280
forms a controller almost completely
necessary

572
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,899
to keep all you know everybody under one
one major

573
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:06,369
bro and it's always going to be

574
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:10,409
in those large types power-hungry
societies

575
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:14,780
the people on the outskirts mom at the
people who

576
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,129
can resist and identify those problems
control the people who can actually

577
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:23,520
you know stan on the outside lookin and
Elise

578
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,520
understand everything is going on

579
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,000
you know I N did are are optimally

580
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,918
going to be that the true you know I
think the really true

581
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,868
3 people narrow you know what you term
freedom yet gone say anything I want but

582
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:43,950
you know if I'm just going on watching
TV every night where is a matter

583
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:48,629
what I said if no one hears right so

584
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,000
it's always going to be those people on
the fringes bed are gonna make the

585
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,060
difference is

586
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,710
billionaire be you know the geniuses
that the change things

587
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,730
to come up with new ideas and you know

588
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,940
ultimately a home you know

589
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:07,119
in these show people the weaknesses in
the system

590
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,010
to avoid any you know to avoid

591
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,170
the you know negative aspects

592
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:20,089
a controlling power say to get leo

593
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:24,750
and that's it that's all I've really
absent a presentation

594
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:30,060
there have any questions

595
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:37,060
alright no questions I a question

596
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,910
right okay this is purely speculative
but it's a it's a good question

597
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,759
because they say for example history
does repeat itself and a group of people

598
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,240
you know whatever happens

599
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,890
and you know the misinformation

600
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,310
the powers that be become so apparent
where the masses say I

601
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,810
forget this man we've had good day
overthrow the government

602
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:40,320
everything starts to fall day um you
know in the time of the Roman Empire

603
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,180
unit didn't have any data technology
rather infrastructures reading that we

604
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,480
had no your cable or kinda road in good
stuff on

605
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,910
but I mean today if you have it you know
let's just take for example the nicest

606
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,629
day we got fifty states if all the
people managed

607
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,310
people manage to band together
completely abolish the American federal

608
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,250
government well we still have all kinds
of

609
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,520
local government institutions and I mean
that %um

610
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,500
America was founded on the principle
love localized you know

611
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,520
localized government okay you got
community know we got our own

612
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,210
you know leaders and stuff and then you
got that the county

613
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,980
in this state and then after the state
the federal government and I mean

614
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,700
really it's one of those were the main
points the Civil War

615
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,270
right in the Civil War was the horrible
horrible thing mean

616
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,560
really you know miss Abby sever after
when it was done

617
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,099
you know does that happen but I am you
know what are the main things with

618
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,780
states rights the state's audio

619
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,280
hey we're suppose we'll do whatever we
want federal government

620
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,099
no government said no no no you do we
said okay yeah okay so I love the issues

621
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,660
the federal government was right

622
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,200
and some other states at some serious
you know moral

623
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,010
bad things going on but a um

624
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,040
you know ultimately the whole the whole
principle the country was that okay have

625
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,150
you know little your smaller states
large

626
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,290
large by oversee everything and take
care the farm policy in the state to

627
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,150
take girls so

628
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,020
I in my opinion I think that if the
federal government to get overthrown or

629
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,609
you know they're sure their private
chaos for a while you know we might be

630
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:13,490
trying to

631
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:18,359
save energy for purse are now but
exactly happened but um

632
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:21,480
you know I think that we have enough
local types of institutions

633
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,710
in place where people would be able to
pick up the pieces relatively quickly

634
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:29,950
without being plunged into a

635
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:36,950
the dark ages surges happen yeah

636
00:39:35,229 --> 00:39:38,160
mom

637
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,670
let's definitely the best ever now in
that's difficult to predict

638
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,800
I am it seems as you

639
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,070
look at I mean the human race in general
war

640
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,180
seems more inviting seems to almost be

641
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,720
naturally inherent in human nature which
I i mean I don't like I don't agree with

642
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,950
it um

643
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,380
and I don't it's hard to say where comes
from I mean

644
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,830
you ok people disagree in and they

645
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:11,509
by in a you know the battle each other
but I guess I like to think

646
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,640
idealistic Lee that if something like
that did happen that people

647
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,150
you know maybe after seeing this would

648
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,000
would learn lessons for I mean if you
could see the negative aspects

649
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,540
warlike with the with the Iraq or
Afghanistan you know we don't

650
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,650
you don't even see allow the stuff that
goes on over there

651
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,550
in a lifetime new do see that people
going in

652
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:37,390
shooting other people you know I mean I
remember what I read

653
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,190
all quiet on the western front you know
which was one the biggest

654
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,350
anti-war novels and the part that sticks
out my brain the most

655
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,140
is when you know the guys walk into the
trenches

656
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,230
you know he's gone to the trenches any
hits the body of a dead German guy

657
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:56,580
right in thing is World War one any

658
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,370
guy roles over his wall falls out and
there's a picture of his family you know

659
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,319
his wife and kids

660
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,460
and ago is now a character in the book
is like

661
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,950
a d a what

662
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:11,770
and I think that you know I mean if you
think I've

663
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,750
a state of war I mean if if one side the
room the close one the other side of the

664
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,070
room just are killing each other

665
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,750
you know now all the people that are
related to you know the people that you

666
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,160
love for the you love that

667
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,649
you know as you die they're gone now now

668
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,200
they're gonna be really said and it's
going to really suck for them if they

669
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,860
really liked it but a

670
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:36,400
has a but you know i i guess i like to
think an idealistic point of view

671
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,080
you know if something like that did
happen that people will be able to band

672
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:40,520
together

673
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,930
in such a way that they wouldn't have to
resort to

674
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:48,790
you know warfare and a constant state
work but

675
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:55,790
as yet

676
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:30,780
yes

677
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,220
that actually

678
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,180
yet those nursing point especially since
america's

679
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,890
I guess bomb the largest hours early
March lows military there in the world

680
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:04,480
today

681
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,880
i mean a lot world %um you take a look
at the iraqi

682
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,040
we didn't want iraq within months and I
was embarrassed so

683
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,270
which i think is everyone will keep me
we did a result

684
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:17,359
and now people are following suit is a1
a slice of the pie

685
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,319
they want lol mine you know the Koreans
and everyone else who fought there who

686
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:23,420
had big stakes in the country you know
the

687
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,819
okay we want to be there now because you
know but yet so I mean if you think

688
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:28,460
about it

689
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,540
the United States did fall I mean how
many

690
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,069
countries in the world could retain
control over their people

691
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:39,750
it's such a large power were to bomb
it's interesting you have to make sure

692
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,940
the people in their societies were
extremely happy with where they were

693
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:49,940
hoping

694
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:56,359

arrogant I apologize

save it but by a

697
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:06,680
