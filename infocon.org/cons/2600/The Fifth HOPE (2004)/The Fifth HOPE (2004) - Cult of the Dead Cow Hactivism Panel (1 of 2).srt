7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,619
general

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,698
you know running crazy shit that you've
never read anywhere else and

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,759
arm well the years now you know we've
done a lot of different things and we've

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,850
been pretty crazy

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,129
we've been can have well little crazy
you know if you remember the hope where

12
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:38,858
we had the

13
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,190
the Cal is in the skulls in the naked
wrestling going on

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,748
yeah now is pretty intense um

15
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:50,459
but week we like to serve in a large
spectrum interests and

16
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:54,069
you know we're just having a good time
getting crazy get a little nuts

17
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:58,499
but we're also interested in I am new
trend change the world a little bit

18
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:02,219
making it more interesting maybe making
it a little bit better

19
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,359
so few years ago we start getting
involved in phnom hacktivism

20
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:10,439
and as most people probably know now
activism is a

21
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,509
using you have using hacking techniques

22
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,229
applied activism and and actually did

23
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:21,600
we did we did invent the name activism
your

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,000
yeah Omega in CDC invented the term
hacktivism so every time you say the

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,969
word activism

26
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,070
we get a quarter it's awesome is really
great

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,600
um so what we have up here now is a we
don't have any naked wrestling

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,929
learn and missus guys want get into it
later but I am

29
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:43,710
we actually have is a fantastic panel if
people to talk about Pactiv is a minute

30
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,240
now this is

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,049
this is really a fantastic opportunity
and

32
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,450
the guy in the CDC has been really
spearheading our this in

33
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,450
and being the in the binding force
behind all our efforts in hacktivism

34
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,799
I is oxblood over here so what I'm to
turn over to him

35
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,590
and he's gonna turn over to them and
they're gonna turn over

36
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,590
to you so that's it

37
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:18,090
just one announcement before we get
going not pleased to make this

38
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,890
announcement

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,019
but I eric ream who is sitting on our
panel

40
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,129
a is an attorney and his team
representing

41
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,899
lotta Packers 2600 I believe also

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,549
he staying in a hotel here he left his
door slightly ajar

43
00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:35,950
turned his back and moments later
somebody lifted his computer out his

44
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,349
room

45
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,599
I'm really hoping it's not somebody here
somebody associated with the conse-

46
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,840
the conference also fully realize

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,400
yeah but it's possible that somebody
might know something about this or might

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,730
have seen something or heard something
whatever

49
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,000
it is a del

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,689
laptop in the aluminum Halliburton

51
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:04,790
case serve anybody compartment does have
any information about this or

52
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,989
anything that that might help america's
computer bag that would be fabulous

53
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,239
could speak with an organizer Eric
directly and

54
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,720
that's great on a more pleasant note

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,849
it is in fact our 20th anniversary

56
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:26,030
and we've seen a lot of groups come and
go

57
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,959
hacking scene one group consistently is
being there

58
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,370
fellow travelers friends and at a time
when

59
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,129
the administration current
administration in this country is

60
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,290
exporting lot of fear into the world

61
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,170
this group has consistently exported ho
and we like to thank 2608 Emanuel

62
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:54,170
as

63
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,469
says 0 said we've been working with

64
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:03,379
activism mostly because we invented it
but it as

65
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:08,120
in fact gone out and there many flavors
some people

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,680
claim to be activists are doing activist
things or developing

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,709
activist aP's but we have a very clear
definition

68
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,989
what we believe activism to be for us

69
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,340
it is using technology to improve human
rights

70
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,660
across electronic media had to be
smaller group

71
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,580
some group within the CDC that's been
doing a lot of work and activism

72
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,030
has been primarily interested in opening
up the Internet

73
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,670
in the so-called fire world countries
through developing applications or

74
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,580
working with grassroots

75
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,770
organizations and the human rights
community

76
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,590
a for us technology and human rights go
together

77
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,710
that is activism in our view if other
people

78
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,219
are doing other things and I'm not
really sure what to call it could be

79
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,210
cyber activism or digital dissidence or
whatever it is

80
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,370
that interviewed and actors and their
certain

81
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,160
even tactics that we think are
appropriate

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,150
for instance zeros mentioning that

83
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,910
we started off by writing water T files
that was really the first

84
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,410
City incarnation or mandated CDC in

85
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,230
is really all about free speech and then
we started working at activism in trying

86
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,070
to

87
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,520
you get past all these firewalls lot of
people couldn't figure it out

88
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,270
response to mention goofy guys right
files like sex with Satan

89
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,930
money lost in the journal feed bombers
Mike my particular favorite the first

90
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,420
and and so what does that have to do
with opening up the Internet

91
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,590
there really is a straight line from
free speech to

92
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,050
somebody being able to hear your free
speech so the two files and the

93
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,830
application development or the other
work for doing activism does go very

94
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,240
clearly together

95
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,930
and it's interesting that we never
really knew

96
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,100
where this was gonna go like so many
things when it was started

97
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,920
was about eight years ago we started
wrestling around with these ideas and

98
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,690
for six years

99
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,520
very actively working it started out
with a few people in the CDC

100
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,140
few friends increasingly activities has
grown to be

101
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,380
international hacking organization with
members

102
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,440
in North America South America People's
Republic of China

103
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,030
India Australia Iran Japan and Russia

104
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,740
it truly is an international
organization we set out to make it

105
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,360
that way because the internet is an
international

106
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,770
communications medium that everybody
should have access to

107
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,120
one interesting thing I think said the
CDC is done

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,700
is to try to bring hackers and the human
rights community together

109
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,780
I don't know if anybody here made it to
Def Con about three years ago

110
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,360
we had doctor patrick all then

111
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,540
the deputy director human rights for the
American Association for the Advancement

112
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,210
of Science

113
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,090
I came to Def Con and we're up on a
sweltering hot group

114
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,060
with as many people for about two hours
and

115
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,180
the place was just like a hot houses
brutal set up there

116
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,380
and hardly anybody left because Patrick
just held the audience was just like

117
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,750
so incredible to have the speaker like
that come

118
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,420
and two talk to hackers in their own
language

119
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:47,530
and a very bizarre an amusing incident
came out of that

120
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,340
as some of you know Patrick essentially
gather the forensic evidence

121
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,640
that brought slobodan milosevic to trial

122
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,340
she tied all the threads together is a
statistician and he managed to find

123
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,340
all the points the pointed the finger to
milosevic in as a result dad

124
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,700
milosevic was arrested and is currently

125
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,220
his trial has been ongoing for a couple
years

126
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,340
Patrick went and testified against
milosevic after he appeared at Def Con

127
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,730
as a guest at the cult how course

128
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,460
milosevic's representing himself and

129
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,060
Patrick testified against milosevic then
milosevic

130
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,509
have the right to cross-examine him and
its first question was

131
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:39,370
so doctor all what can you tell me about
these dead

132
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,049
Cal called so you guys may be interested
you never know what's gonna happen in

133
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:44,790
your future

134
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,019
videos floating around on the internet
somewhere as a yes yes

135
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:53,930
you can actually see did now

136
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,329
so I'm I've been talking about activism
for quite a few years now

137
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,069
and rather than happy spew on and many
people here

138
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:04,759
many things I've said before I wanted to

139
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,879
bring together a distinguished panel of
experts

140
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,259
all from different fields in all looking
at this phenomenon

141
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,550
from different perspectives

142
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,600
it is my great pleasure and high honor
to introduce

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,569

at the University of Toronto I each

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,680
panels will speak 20 minutes or so

155
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,769
at the end we'll have a Q+A and it's

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:14,769
so chairman place

157
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,830
ox Lam a little shorter than you

158
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,250
thank you I wanna

159
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,530
specially thank you for including us

160
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,400
on this panel and I'd like to publicly
thank you for the support you've been

161
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,490
getting to our work

162
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,170
for a number of years now and we look
forward to working together

163
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:43,380
to me is it up no

164
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,890
mill

165
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,050
K thank you kick I originally had a
different title

166
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,800
for the talk and I was really the rise
of the Internet in China

167
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,010
a cautionary tale comma a narrative of
hope

168
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,730
but I think I'm gonna focus more on the
theme of technology and human rights

169
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:11,730
was stark communication technologies

170
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,690
and printing press telephone internet
radio cell phone fax machines all these

171
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,060
communication technologies

172
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,490
have most recently fax machines you can
see the power particularly in the 1989

173
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,810
crackdown in China

174
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,540
but for our purposes today I'm wanna
talk a bit about internet

175
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,760
as an example the technology in some of
the issues around that with respect to

176
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,640
human rights work

177
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,319
what what my organization does human
rights

178
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,890
and what I mean by human rights nada

179
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,670
abstract I'm talking about D principles
and norms that have emerged

180
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:52,939
primarily post-world war two these are
the principles and norms have emerged so

181
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,970
that the world

182
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,630
could be safe for democracy and peace
and

183
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,530
has now become harder are a whole system

184
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,230
love institutions and processes
primarily in the UN

185
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,140
and other bodies and stakeholders a word
I hate but as a word that is used in our

186
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,770
field

187
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,850
refers to the people the group their
active in human rights and this means it

188
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:17,520
includes

189
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,210
governments it includes ngos like ours

190
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,450
non-governmental organizations in
involves

191
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,720
other civil society actors it also
involves

192
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,410
as we all-new multinational corporations

193
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,699
and then it involves whole host of other
associate like

194
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,790
research think tanks sector the media
sectors such a

195
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,920
so when I talk about communication
technologies and the Internet and human

196
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,010
rights talking about

197
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,510
these whole clusters a process season
peoples and actors an idea

198
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,990
another this

199
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,210
connection what I'd like to begin and
end with is

200
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:59,810
an invitation and ongoing invitation for
us to think about ways in which we can

201
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,820
together

202
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,440
build more affective alliances

203
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,480
of conscience because that's what's
called for those of us involved in human

204
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,340
rights work

205
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,950
and those %uh view in there hacker
community that has been involved in

206
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,820
working with us

207
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,960
you know what i'm saying the cards are
stacked against us

208
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,950
when we talk about china China is if not
be

209
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,200
Holy Grail for hackers I wanna be
presumptuous to tell you what your Holy

210
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,810
Grail is

211
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,340
China must certainly be one %uh the most
important Holy Grails for hacking

212
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,560
because if you can hack China if you
could help us break

213
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,600
open china you have done more than just
China you've done something

214
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,560
really major for more than 1.3 billion
people in China

215
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,620
is gonna affect the world so partly why
I'm asking today is

216
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,440
to ask you to join us even the odds even
the odds

217
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,710
and come on on our side because we're
like

218
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,150
this small NGO communities limited
resources

219
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,420
limited by in large low-tech low-tech

220
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,700
techies and we desperately need you and
because that's what's gonna

221
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,140
even against an incredible Alliance of
global capital

222
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,750
a multi-national corporate profits
interest

223
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,740
a very powerful police state that is now

224
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,160
in an increasingly post-9/11 world has
been able to very successfully

225
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,680
opportunistically exploit the rhetoric
of anti-terrorism

226
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,880
and and I must have to say the US is
making it quite

227
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,980
easy for them on they've raised the bar

228
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,190
now the Chinese can say don't talk to us
about human rights violations

229
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,710
Guantanamo Bay iraq and then their
silence

230
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,050
as what are we to say after that so it
is a very

231
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,750
serious dismal serious challenge that we
face

232
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,000
and so I'm want to call for us building
even

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,220
more effective alliances and I've only
been here today I'm

234
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,500
just got back from other countries some
a little bit jet-lagged

235
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,060
but it was so exciting to see see love
you and your love you talking in the

236
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,320
hallway and I said

237
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,320
yeah this group can join this you this
book and do something

238
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,300
I'm gonna do a very quick %uh overview

239
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,660
up what I think is I will call that the
conventional story

240
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,790
and as a story you probably read about
in the Western media

241
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,420
is primarily the dominant story that's
being pitched by China

242
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,050
which I will call the you know the
infrastructure people those who might be

243
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,420
familiar with the World Summit on the
information society

244
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,600
esposa de this discussion about the
future of the information society in the

245
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,940
21st century

246
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,940
that is dominated by the infrastructure
people who are focusing on some other

247
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,880
things that i'm gonna quickly go over

248
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,840
so I want to just go through the
conventional story and I'd like to

249
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,500
interrogate

250
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,510
taking apart a little bit and as the
more important question

251
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,530
kit for civil you'll hear this a lot you
know China's internet users

252
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,550
on who are they there now over 70 9.5
million online

253
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,580
but this is only 6.2 percent other

254
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,870
1.3 billion people and growing

255
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,110
but who's online predominately

256
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,330
young male and

257
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,480
college educated or with education

258
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,550
and predominantly located in urban areas

259
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,600
77 6 percent earned less than 2,000 yen

260
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,280
which is 250 US but that's a misleading
stat also

261
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,480
because wine earning less than two
thousand UN

262
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,720
or 2000 Chinese dollars is because they
supported by the parents

263
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,180
so these are primarily students so it
looks like they're in an economically

264
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,020
lower class but

265
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,449
pack they're not there part other most
special

266
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,320
elite privileged in China a very small
percentage

267
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,240
that make it to get an education okay

268
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,330
we look at the gender breakout you'll
see that the gender breakout is that

269
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,000
even though you see its orders leveling
off

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,099
on it's primarily male and from 1997
when the internet really

271
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,880
kind of took off in China it was
eighty-seven percent male users and in

272
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,290
2004

273
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,920
its really evening out a little bit at
about 60 percent 62.4 percent now

274
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,110
K in terms of their education

275
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,130
you can see this and what would have
been interesting this is the stat that

276
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,870
perhaps another

277
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,140
we will be doing an HR I see a follow up
with work on education

278
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,480
is that if you take this and map this
against who gets educated in China

279
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,070
this is gonna look even more revealing
in other words this is just looking at

280
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,570
who

281
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,639
up the percentage abusers and what the
educational background is what you can

282
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,900
see from the pie chart

283
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,560
primarily is that at most the people
online have

284
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,460
a basic education or higher junior
college

285
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,250
bachelor you note sector okay in

286
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,860
from 1997 2004 will the picture speaks
for itself

287
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,750
right you had 620,000 people online in
1997 and now you have

288
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,190
79.5 million needless to say you can see

289
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,460
it is growing astronomically where they
call a damn

290
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,280
you know exponentially exponentially

291
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,550
and on but what does that mean okay

292
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:21,520
in an it's also growing not just in the
number of internet users

293
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,889
it's growing from the .cn but register
domain names and if you look at the

294
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,520
register domain names

295
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,530
on the increase in 1997 was from four
thousand 66 registered to 2004

296
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,850
340,000 for in forty

297
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,350
registered .cn domain

298
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,010
but this is the

299
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,830
from another perspective not from the
perspective of numbers

300
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,570
not from the perspective up these you
know usually and breathtaking terms if

301
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,250
you read about lots of the Internet in
China studies

302
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,620
or books articles this is what you get
it tends to be this brekkie

303
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,380
huh look at China millions and millions
everyone's wired its online its joining

304
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,450
the 21st century

305
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,160
get this kinda breathless account of
technology in China

306
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,530
but against another perspective if you
look at it from the perspective of

307
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:17,879
human development this is another
mapping and this is what it looks like

308
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,220
you look at the green areas

309
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,060
that's the so-called hi development
areas and when we say human development

310
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,139
we're talking about

311
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,240
life expectancy literate literacy
healthcare

312
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,490
on a a all the basic indicators

313
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,170
right this is how it's measured if you
see either

314
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,560
yellow sorta yellow areas that's what
they call

315
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,659
medium development but I just want to
point out how deceptive that is as well

316
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,620
this comes in the UNDP the United
Nations Development Programme their

317
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,610
stats

318
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,790
take a look at Sinjar which as you know
the chinese are now calling the hotbed

319
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,270
of terrorism and they're really

320
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:01,220
cracking down on transit executions and
these have been really rising

321
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,850
and anything that goes under the ambit
anyone

322
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,980
attempt to assert cultural identity

323
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,620
in stingy on is being labeled terrorists

324
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,840
so an attempt to perhaps practice chick
to maintain the weaker

325
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,290
language history religion

326
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,510
practices is being met with a label

327
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,790
a split is anti-terrorist and on

328
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,170
anti-china so how is it that sings young
one of the poorest

329
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,480
ethnic minority areas in China gets to
be medium development

330
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,570
because at the massive colonization the
has been taking place

331
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,659
and that has displaced ethnic minorities

332
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,920
I a M ethnically Han Chinese

333
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,930
so my group is the vast majority we are
96 percent

334
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,500
of the ethnic groups in China and I had
a chance to

335
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,490
backpack and go to the desert ensign
John as a hun Chinese woman which people

336
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,360
that was a really stupid

337
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,670
dangerous thing to do fortunately I
didn't know that at the time

338
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,970
till I came back from the desert and
they said that was a stupid thing to do

339
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,530
at but it was really interesting because
I got to see firsthand

340
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,750
just the devastation and when you move
further out you see a city that had been

341
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,240
75 eighty percent

342
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,670
weaker is now 75 eighty percent

343
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,460
hun Chinese so what has happened with
colonization

344
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,880
in addition to the massive deployment of
PLL

345
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,760
pela troops in the region de garis in
their these armelle

346
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,960
military troops that are garrison there
permanently

347
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,340
on they have made and major infusion

348
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,429
of money for the infrastructure so that
the central government in beijing can

349
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,480
say look

350
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,350
with developing the outer regions the
not developing for the locals

351
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,750
developing it for the high on colonists
who have colonized the area and so it's

352
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,810
quite complex but that's just a quick

353
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,000
now if you look at the vast majority of
China it is

354
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
on less-developed and less developed as
you're gonna see is a real euphemism

355
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,890
on the be endless

356
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,360
I want to take a look at this cuz it's
kind of interesting because

357
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,930
it looks like been with except for a
little bit over

358
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,690
a in inda 0 for July 2002

359
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,610
and then sorta January 2003 when there
was a massive

360
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,950
industry restructuring and also
restructuring at the ministers

361
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,170
than ministries responsible for
overseeing the development

362
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,020
the red the Internet you see essentially
8 Grohl

363
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,620
a growing up her in band with in China

364
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,840
and I just once a couple things about
that one

365
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,629
the demand for increase speed and
greater bandwidth

366
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,640
has come from inside China which is both
a sign of hope

367
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,890
and something very interesting from
turns being able to exploit it

368
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,410
it's come from various sectors it's come
from the government

369
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,640
themselves it's come from the academics

370
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,990
it's come from the business community
it's come from

371
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,270
these main sectors because they want the
fast connectivity

372
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,330
and they need it to the outside but what
happens is the government is trapped

373
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,980
between needing to have the broadband
access

374
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,830
and the speed and connectivity to enable
it to globally integrate and become part

375
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,210
of the world

376
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,860
wtoo a session et cetera and for them to
be able to work with their outside

377
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,830
governments and partners and businesses
et cetera

378
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,330
an the absolute need that the government
seized control

379
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,030
the Internet control the content control
who's on it

380
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,379
and two a and in every aspect

381
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,270
and every time they tried to put further
surveillance and control

382
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,970
and content filtrations and putting it
all the different routing systems

383
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,720
they're slowing it down to go through
through routing systems

384
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,290
you know you've slowed down the traffic
and that's a very

385
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,730
interesting tension between the
government trying to control which

386
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,030
results in slower

387
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,360
speeds and this incredible domestic
consumer

388
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,160
driven and a government and business
need to have the speed

389
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,110
the second thing about that that's
interesting is is that it's also coming

390
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,540
from

391
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,260
outside China to have this greater
access and speed and that's coming from

392
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,580
all of the international global
communities at working with China

393
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,250
you look at the access to the Internet a
vast personal

394
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,910
percentage other is coming from home now
home access

395
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,030
that you should read as coded as

396
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,230
class economic privilege

397
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,580
economic elites because the able to have

398
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,230
a computer you could have at home and
you could pay me for the connective ity

399
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,370
and the line whether it's langley so

400
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,460
high speed which many people are getting
on means that you can afford it

401
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,140
this is primarily in the largest cities
the largest percentage did you take a

402
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,760
look at the internet cafe

403
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,170
it's only like 20 percent now you may
have read a great deal about

404
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,920
internet cafes be shut down and this is
all I want to say about that

405
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,080
this a disproportionate impact on poor

406
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,350
migrants workers in

407
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,990
smaller cities and royal areas so when
you hear about the shutdown on the

408
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,340
internet cafes

409
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,510
it's not affecting the people who have
access at home

410
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,580
and you actually are better off it's
affecting much lower

411
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,379
or people so that thats really important
and one that calls for is that we need

412
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,900
greater granularity in our understanding

413
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,280
when we look at the development on the
Internet and when you when we hear about

414
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,540
surveillance

415
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,670
and censorship that it has a
disproportionate

416
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:46,050
impact that's located in very concrete
material realities

417
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,460
this is based on a a survey that

418
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,700
job the China Internet network
information center CNNIC

419
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,910
I see did based on data from January
2004

420
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:02,170
and they posted you know a survey on
their website and they got over 49,000

421
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:07,030
683 responses and that's a lot of these
responses are based on sixteen thousand

422
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,360
seven hundred sixty thousand responses

423
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,370
and they also did some face to face and
survey data

424
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,650
but so some other issue that I see is
based on all that on

425
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,640
you see a large percentage saying that
their they use it for what they use it

426
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,970
for getting information

427
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:26,320
second large percentage the user to be
entertained

428
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,810
and then there's a little bit of
studying making friends

429
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,928
and then you have some jumping on
bandwagons some weird shit like that

430
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,320
you know and but the important thing is

431
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,710
what does it mean that they're getting
information

432
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,360
in a society in a context in a culture
where the information is already

433
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,550
controlled

434
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,639
with a spin on it and the story about it
is already controlled

435
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,960
and where the government

436
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,720
actually to a very careful system which
I talk a little bit more about

437
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,410
but we just issued a report
unfortunately it's only in Chinese now

438
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,470
and the first two chapters of our report
is on media censorship in China

439
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,010
is available online at our website you
can get the first two chapters

440
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:11,679
and it's a report on how the actually
tell you not only what can't be said

441
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,790
but the actually tell you what can be
said

442
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,909
and not only what can be said they tell
you the words you have to use to say it

443
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:24,520
in other words it is highly contested
whether you refer to taiwan

444
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,889
as a comma Province of China

445
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,560
versus taiwan period

446
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,820
and it becomes extremely really you
could get your whole paper shut down

447
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,540
because you forgot to put comma Province
of China

448
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,200
or something like that so the the
accessed information raises very

449
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,040
important fundamental questions about

450
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,510
information to what and what is all
that's been about that

451
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,200
%uh the second thing you're just a point
out is that there's a real question

452
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,330
those of you who are doing research on
China when you see surveys

453
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:02,090
and when you see data from the surveys
particularly official surveys

454
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,990
done by China we think it's useful
because it gives us some kinda the

455
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,070
baseline

456
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,810
in normally for torture statistics in
all the work that we do

457
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,179
we know those numbers are vastly
under-reported

458
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,850
so when you look at somebody studies
those who are doing this area you have

459
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,060
to also say

460
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,830
let's look at the methodology and in a
pervasive culture

461
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,230
where there's fear and reporting like
what does it mean

462
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,340
answer the service like what is possibly
mean

463
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,470
and to really keep that skeptical I
don't need to tell hackers

464
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,470
maintain a skeptical attitude towards
authority but I'll just say that now

465
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,810
in our okay maintain especially the
Chinese government

466
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,050
it's like be afraid be very careful

467
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:46,740
okay this is also onto some reasons that
were given for not using the net

468
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,230
and that i think is important because at
UCL

469
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,630
the largest percentages they don't know
how to use a computer

470
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,840
and they don't know anything about the
Internet so we think

471
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,750
off the computer and technology
particularly internet as this

472
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,270
democratizing force

473
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,430
it with that start with people who say

474
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,880
let what's computer now the

475
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,010
will you not the internet is right so I
think we need

476
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,260
and they don't have the equipment which
also you can code as class

477
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,060
and privilege and money King

478
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,350
K well there's a debate that goes on and
there's lotsa studies which I will not

479
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,960
rehearse

480
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,460
or repeat I'm just gonna summarized in
this next couple frames

481
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,580
because I don't think the debate to me
is real interesting and the debate has

482
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,949
to do with

483
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,890
is technology a democratizing force or
is a tool for repression

484
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,420
and our view working in the field as we
don't have the luxury that intellectual

485
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,930
debate we think it's both

486
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,300
we think is both in different
percentages we think it sometimes helps

487
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,230
each other sometimes we think its
intention

488
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,190
sometimes we think it's productive
conflict sometimes we think there's a

489
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,500
ripple effect you can even predict

490
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,010
and so that's my view about that debate
but in terms of technologies promise

491
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,150
I would say that at least it can
function

492
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,590
not necessarily inevitably but it can be
democratizing force

493
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,190
it can be a powerful tool for creating a

494
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,970
virtual community activist both inside
China

495
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,380
and outside in fact if not can be has

496
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,530
started to create such a community

497
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,740
and finally it can be. from the
perspective of the government in

498
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,950
particular

499
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:29,810
a powerful tool for global economic
integration and cultural integration

500
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,370
you can be dead as cultural imperialism
a welcoming

501
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,600
the jeans and the music in the film in
the CD in the videos

502
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,700
and I put that down as a positive
promise because I think

503
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,200
as activists and as human rights
activist we can exploit that

504
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,450
however lil

505
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,000
the promise this also has teachers

506
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,750
and yes it's a democratizing force but
as the cut government has shown

507
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,490
by investing in throwing hundreds of
millions and I think even

508
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,350
we can get figure on this I would
venture it's more than a billion some

509
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:09,420
dollars and resources it has become a
very powerful tool of repression

510
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,730
propaganda and authoritarian control

511
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,240
that's what technology can do we could
talk about biometrics we can talk about

512
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,290
systems are operational in China

513
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,430
we can talk about now the police station
said a fleet all their computers

514
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,060
we could talk about digital cameras that
are now in tiananmen square

515
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,450
we can talk about then matching faces we
can talk about within 48 hours

516
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,440
they can't catch a dissident that left
one train station

517
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,550
and catch within 48 hours official
recognition matchup in another

518
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:42,419
this is all built by and I know that
there was a debate not only get flamed

519
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,320
immediately

520
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,830
but that the it is a infrastructure that
has been built

521
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,699
with and been profitable to a vast

522
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,410
far in corporate community and they
continue to do so particularly in the

523
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,610
lead up to the Olympics and they have
bid for and they

524
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,680
are the builders for the security system
for the Olympics and they have gotten

525
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,900
the construction contract

526
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,660
and their building it now and from my
perspective of course we have to protect

527
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,690
the athletes

528
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,780
but I think from human rights
perspective we're asking this question

529
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,889
are you leaving behind even more
powerful

530
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:19,050
architecture of control and surveillance

531
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,320
and just giving them the state of the
Arts

532
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,149
so the lesson is on global economic
integration what has really happened

533
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,920
and this is its a I think that term as a
as a lawyer

534
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,830
and as a human rights activist when I
face economists and the corporate

535
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,919
community the usually treat us like were
like making soft arguments like we're

536
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,520
not scientific like

537
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,379
were not empirical so what they sayin
status free markets

538
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,870
market is Asian privatization arm

539
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,350
your economic liberalization and that
that's inevitably going to be a

540
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,460
trickle-down effect that's gonna result
in greater

541
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,870
social just as blah blah blah for the
vast majority people

542
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,940
was bizarre it didn't work here

543
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,010
trickle-down didn't work here why would
it work

544
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:10,010
in China anyplace else in the world
since when have people

545
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,040
since when did economic or political
elites get all the goods and decide she

546
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,620
will share it

547
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,100
like willing thought you know in like it
doesn't happen

548
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,810
it doesn't happen so this argument that
you'll hear

549
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,909
and most recently stupidly on the front
pages of the New York Sunday Times had

550
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:33,060
to get into that enough time to write
the op-ed

551
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,570
is that you know the creation of a
growing middle class in China

552
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,070
six million right now is going to result
in graders

553
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,610
democratization in China is garbage is
not can result in

554
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:46,970
doing time is going to result in greater
democratization is that the masses for

555
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:49,480
the people are going to have to organize
and demanded

556
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,990
and they're gonna get ourselves it will
not come from an elite

557
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,620
and so the reality of on even economic
development

558
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,780
is the reality

559
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,990
I'm going to get three quick examples of
what I mean by

560
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:08,050
the pervasive are infrastructure
problems in China

561
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,190
and one is has to do with the legal
system

562
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,600
there's been a lot of I love up a
fanfare

563
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,460
a lot of attention and a lot of our
owners working in China

564
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,940
you know about legal reforms in saying
that China has rewritten lost

565
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,070
house in San thousands have lost that
supposed to improve

566
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,940
administrative you know it due process
and in you have a right to a lawyer have

567
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,839
a right to a phone call even have a
right to see the evidence against you

568
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:33,929
cetera et cetera

569
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,540
most these occurred in 1997 and human
rights in China

570
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:40,629
we did a three-year study will be
tracked

571
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:44,069
actual cases and you can get that on our
website it's called

572
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,560
empty promises and we have names we have
the cases

573
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,480
can you see overwhelmingly in the
politicized cases state security state

574
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,240
secrets all those cases

575
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,980
counter-revolutionary hooliganism that
with ya love you

576
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,010
hooligans you know just refuse to like
listen

577
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,410
on those cases over and over you see in
the chart

578
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:08,859
no lawyer no counsel did not see the
evidence did not hit the family visit

579
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:12,130
over and over and over so we think it's
really important

580
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,430
that when you look at what supposedly
has been happening

581
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,870
that's just the picture on the books
it's not the reality

582
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,569
and interns are due process the vast
majority executions

583
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,940
the highest number when you think about
the high number of executions

584
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,070
I sometimes get met by Americans who say
to me so

585
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,290
we have the death penalty in this
country said yes

586
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,660
this is true but we're talking about in
China where there's

587
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,040
almost no system in other words

588
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,300
you're not talking about a lawyer and
getting a right to appeal you not to get

589
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,390
to be on death row his death row may
last exactly 24

590
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:50,609
hours it's not years appeal so I think
it's extremely serious the high rate of

591
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:51,569
executions

592
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,370
in China and secondly the lawyers

593
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,380
the defenders of the human rights
defenders are now coming under attack

594
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,580
and now there are at least according to
Chinese lawyers who are documenting this

595
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,339
over 300 criminal defense lawyers

596
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:11,290
who had been attacked and what we mean
by attacked we mean that they're

597
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,570
then charged with bogus trumped-up
charges

598
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,620
and very intimidated and most
importantly

599
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:23,990
you have a lawyer who was the head are
the Committee to Protect lawyers

600
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,260
independent suppliers the Beijing bar
and he

601
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,040
gets put in the slammer for really
trumped-up charges

602
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,770
and it's important that Chinese lawyers
have come to the defense up these

603
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:38,150
I there there's one lawyer that human
rights in China has been working with

604
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:42,520
and he represented over 300 cases the
people been forced out of their homes

605
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,839
and so he's really quite sophisticated
quite an activist and

606
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,759
and and a hero he faxed us some
information that had been public

607
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,150
he attempted to fax didn't get through
but because they had all the records in

608
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,040
the fax machine he was then charged

609
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,690
with leaking state secrets
notwithstanding the fact that have been

610
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,270
reported in a newspaper that was
irrelevant

611
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,259
and he was sentenced to three years lost
the first appeal he's now doing

612
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,130
other appeals you can go to our website
and ears a legal

613
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,500
campaign out being mounted by us with
American lawyers and some Hong Kong

614
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,520
lawyers and

615
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,910
also with the UN independence of judges
in judiciary

616
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,540
a special Robert her we are trying to
work on getting him released

617
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,160
and are is really important that when a
system starts attacking

618
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,210
lawyers who are supposed to be
protecting people's rights

619
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,690
we are really added quite a very
dangerous point

620
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,089
the other thing is separate from the
regular court system you have a whole

621
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:36,890
system

622
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,410
are what we call administrative
detention that means

623
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,279
no process at all no charge no process

624
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,050
nothing years and one example I want to
give this

625
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,350
reform through labor that is you know
you get reeducated to labor

626
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,560
and by the government statistics alone

627
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,029
they have admitted to 100 I wasn't

628
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:03,630
a year I detained under the system and
if you don't behave inside

629
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,910
that is that another two or three years
and I just you know

630
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,529
go on and on public health

631
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,270
I think the US population is between
$350 million to something

632
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,640
$700 million rural inhabitants

633
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,779
had no basic nothing health care

634
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,170
and then you're talking about huge AIDS
epidemic and so you can imagine what

635
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,170
happened during the SARS outbreak as
well

636
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:31,140
to talking about a total collapse under
market reforms

637
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,190
privatization total collapse

638
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:38,839
healthcare basic primary health care and
you have a project at ten million

639
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,140
infections in China

640
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,370
HIV-aids extremely serious on

641
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,930
public education I just want to give a
quick because we are working very hard

642
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,839
on issues with respect to children

643
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:53,589
and vertically my grandchildren is an
estimated 120 to 140

644
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:57,830
million migrants in China these are
people that are just moving

645
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:01,440
floating population and I love that
we've documented

646
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,520
at least one point eight million
children who have no basic

647
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,160
education and that means they're
relegated to a life

648
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,299
condemned right to the bottom of the
bucket

649
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,770
I wanted them but like when we talk
about technology and we talk about the

650
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,050
Internet

651
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,430
let's just get down to some real where
the rubber meets the road

652
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,740
electricity phones and running water

653
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,550
and what you see is in the western
provinces which is singe on all the poor

654
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,530
provinces

655
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,630
only 91.1 percent have even running
water

656
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,990
and telephones only 9.2 percent

657
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,380
and these numbers under-reported because
these are the numbers you get

658
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,620
officially ya and then you have
electricity which looks like they have

659
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,620
electricity but

660
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,430
having lived and worked a great deal in
China the last 18 years

661
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,560
everyone to take it for granted it's
tuesday there's no electricity

662
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,440
but I would know that I would go into
each and then suddenly I be doing a

663
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,210
training program in the wall in the dark

664
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,130
and nobody seems have sex at me going
hello where is everybody what is

665
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,080
happening and I'll say

666
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,730
well with Tuesday there's no electricity
that's how we save Tuesday Thursday

667
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:06,740
other days you know

668
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,839
to really talk about unit is electricity
there's a real question of

669
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,359
how stable how often how you know
related

670
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,620
yeah in so I get back to saying okay so
this is all the

671
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,900
this technology which looks breathtaking
you look at the infrastructure numbers

672
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,950
but then you look at the real on even
development realities

673
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,250
I want to come back to china's human
networks

674
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,730
and %uh this might be oxblood h2h
network

675
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,890
and if you look at these these are all
the groups

676
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,109
that I would identify as despite
incredible

677
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:42,460
Arts in China incredible risks

678
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,470
incredible threats and dangers these
groups are all still working and many

679
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,589
other work with us

680
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:52,509
underground so you have the Chinese ngos
their allotted congo's

681
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,160
which are like these fake ngos but
they're also emerging

682
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,319
these really independent ngos and we try
to work with those groups directly and

683
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:02,580
indirectly

684
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,799
there are the workers massive problems
with labor

685
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,290
you don't read about in the major press

686
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,080
the hundreds of thousands of people who
protest

687
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,950
workers who protest the corruption

688
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,420
the millions of dollars a back pay to
disclose up and I had a friend Tommy

689
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,359
that people just cried at a shoe factory
because they went to work and then they

690
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:26,380
were just told

691
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,510
get what you can cause the fact is
closing down to the each get like

692
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,640
10 or 15 pairs of shoes nazi and and
when they sell those on the street

693
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,710
it's over have no social safety net work
but these are the group

694
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,100
and I have minutes on the rap very very
quickly oh my god

695
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:46,010
okay in your on again on

696
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:49,069
the the human network is up against what

697
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:52,540
it's up against what you all know this
very very

698
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,550
are structured and powerful architecture
censorship control

699
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,000
and it's both technical legal social and
it's such very

700
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,680
incredibly organize it every single
level security apparatus

701
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,490
and you can see that company just go
quickly

702
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,580
soccer tournament yeah I keep it not go
back

703
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,279
Becky collect okay the regulatory
framework is important

704
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,380
because it's not only what you keep
reading about the 60-plus

705
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,540
you know all these laws that have been
passed et cetera it's not just that

706
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,300
it's the law within a broader premark of
State Security

707
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,330
state secrets and the criminal

708
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,730
law which criminalizes activities at
many I've

709
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,760
you in this room which is take for
granted you could do

710
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,700
even you know if you think it's criminal
we're talking about you'll see I wanna

711
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,210
give you some pic examples and their

712
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:46,550
this is this is but I want to give some
pretty simple to the state secret law

713
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:50,000
and they a are we are about to issue a
report

714
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,150
on that and you can look for it on our
website and we can issue wouldn't

715
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,120
sections

716
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,470
because the state's secrets law is so
comprehensive

717
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,630
it covers every single area health
environment labor security

718
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,710
and you won't be shocked to find out
life got

719
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,230
competing authority telling anyone going
one minute or York

720
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,430
and I've got Eric the lawyers say take
as much time as you like

721
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,470
hidden so I'll be somewhere between the
two and two minutes

722
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:19,140
a up

723
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,450
thank you thank you and so and

724
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:26,370
some examples that will be you know
documenting is for example

725
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,980
the number of people who protest the
number of deaths

726
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,980
in mind in coal mines the number of
deaths

727
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,640
from occupational hazards the number of
people who

728
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,750
are actually infected with aids the
number of deaths from SARS

729
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:43,980
these are all state secrets

730
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,150
K hit definition a state secrets

731
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,190
state secrets are matters that affect
the security interest to the state

732
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:55,240
well that gives you a really clear
definition right quite a circular

733
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,680
but there's a classification that's
really important top secret

734
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,290
right teeny a highly secret de mi to me.
and then there's

735
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:05,859
secret then there's internal the 20

736
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:10,680
important things about it is new
regulations that went into effect

737
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:15,620
allow you to reclassify based on the
consequences

738
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,009
that means if they decide that you
leaked a newspaper article

739
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,420
fax the to a NGO in New York for example

740
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,609
but it was a newspaper article at the
time it was public it doesn't matter

741
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:30,970
it can be classified retroactively as a
secret

742
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:34,560
because it was deemed to be later

743
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,810
so harmful to the state

744
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,990
so that's the catch that's how

745
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:45,270
you can catch annette that's so wide you
can get anybody

746
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,520
and in fact they have and these are
cases that I know

747
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,589
our colleague bill shies away talked
about I just wanted to just throw them

748
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:52,150
out

749
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,810
and just have you see that these are
just a few the cases an amnesty has a 61

750
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:01,009
we've documented others and and in part
of our casework

751
00:45:01,009 --> 00:45:04,170
we do a lot of advocacy at the UN on
behalf of individual cases

752
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,440
and internet on activists are among a
big group

753
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,460
we brought some copies %uh this is our
English language journal

754
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,990
which I presume most view but prefer
this to the Chinese

755
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:21,009
and so it's the China rights forum and
the Red issue focuses on internet

756
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,299
activist and journalist

757
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:25,880
and as a chart a peep love Internet
activists journalists were present at

758
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,040
the time and we have some copies and
gave

759
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,480
is here from us and Amy my colleague
here we also have copies

760
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,890
also if you want we also brought the
most recent issue

761
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,810
which is on the fiftieth anniversary of
the crackdown because we really don't

762
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,470
think people should forget

763
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:45,029
and we can't forget and we are going on
with our work for that

764
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:52,029
okay

765
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,270
the

766
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:59,460
consequence I'll all of this and II

767
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,410
I like the way bill shot talks about it
as you know the matrix effect in China

768
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:06,830
because within the matrix everyone
believes it's reality and thats

769
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,340
what are the consequences inside China
is that is not only created

770
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,060
censorship and self-censorship has it's
not only created a climate

771
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,600
in a culture of fear and it's also
undermine the capacity of a whole

772
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,320
country in a whole society

773
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,540
to come up with the solutions the
solutions don't get generated it

774
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,390
information is available and if people
are threatened

775
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,609
because the complex problems that are
facing China

776
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:36,020
needs all its people and it can have
them silence

777
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:39,570
I really believe that's what it takes to
deal with China's problems

778
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:43,240
and soul the consequences are the
censorship its it's really

779
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,330
undercutting themselves did you know
that during the Great Leap Forward in

780
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:46,880
China

781
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,550
which is disastrous and millions I think
twenty million people starve to death

782
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,470
because it the disastrous policies

783
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:58,780
other party that when now made his tour
around X countryside to see what the

784
00:46:58,780 --> 00:46:59,730
situation was

785
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,360
they painted patrice because people star
so badly

786
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,620
starvation is not a pretty pictures if
you want to read about it hungry ghosts

787
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,810
is the most powerful book written about
hungry goes

788
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,750
by Jesper backers but they hungry ghosts
hungry ghosts

789
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,820
people scrape the bark of trees

790
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,570
has nothing to eat and they made buns
with dirt just a full Islamic

791
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,070
but when mom went through the
countryside to see what the situation

792
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:23,780
was

793
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:28,490
take painted the trees brown so from
when he went the tour you could see that

794
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,340
in fact that was the real situation

795
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,350
and i think is didn't learn their lesson

796
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,100
if you lie and you don't need
information get out you're not going to

797
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,850
get the solution to deal with it and
frankly they didn't learn their lesson

798
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:40,890
from SARS either

799
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,060
but all this is not new

800
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,220
and that's really important all that has
happened in China's

801
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,770
authoritarian state is it got a
technological upgrade

802
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:56,250
all of the tech technology repression
was a lower-end

803
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,490
but it was very effective during the
Cultural Revolution it was

804
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,220
always been affected and that's
important to remember week

805
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,320
this is all stuff I think you've all
been talking about but some other

806
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,150
empowering role of technology is that it
can amplify

807
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:15,160
the dissident voices an activist voices
it can generate the global support new

808
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,109
tension we need

809
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:20,400
it can create the Underground Railroad
you can create the underground tunnels

810
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,560
and we need you to help us create them
and we need them to create a flow of

811
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,540
uncensored information within China

812
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,370
in an hour China and we need to help
create the virtual spaces for Chinese

813
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,390
citizens to meet

814
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:34,950
and organized and we need to create

815
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,830
shared resource libraries where they can
access it and get

816
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:42,430
online but

817
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,799
all love this role of technology in all
the strategies

818
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,560
has to be grounded enough material
reality of China today

819
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,770
I'm just gonna

820
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,820
very quickly talk about our approach to
maybe I'll talk more about it the Q&A

821
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,860
cuz I'm out of time

822
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,710
yeah on this is the custer

823
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:05,730
the web sites that we're building and we
could use a lot of help building them

824
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:10,270
an there it's all being redesigned both
front-end and back-end so his visit us

825
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:11,810
in about a month or six weeks

826
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,720
you're going to see the new launch of
the new site it's gonna be much more

827
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,170
interactive and will be much more

828
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:20,910
accurately reflect the range what we're
trying to do which is really quite

829
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,770
cutting edge

830
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,420
and the current site doesn't reflect
that so I'm just saying there is a

831
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,030
caveat

832
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,290
an but I'm gonna talk about the wash %ah

833
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:33,270
clash against Bal is an elect is a part
of a very big ambitious initiative

834
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:37,520
and what it is is we use two methods to
techno technological solutions

835
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,640
and we send in 350,000 emails into China

836
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,670
a week and it's a newsletter that we
compile them

837
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,780
edit stories and censored stories that
we get from

838
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,810
inside China that people send us that
work with us

839
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,870
we edit and we send it back in so we get

840
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:59,190
edit and we send it back in we also send
in a proxy link every week

841
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,560
and we work very closely with bill shine
others on this and the proxy link

842
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,060
enables them to directly access we do
channel them to us but it also means

843
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,470
that they could then go on

844
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:13,230
to the net and I want to show you just
very quickly

845
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,540
that the proxy access that's coming to
us

846
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,470
to all to reach means came from China

847
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:24,160
because nobody else is going to try to
need to get to us from a proxy

848
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,930
and you see the percentage to the proxy
and you see the up and down on proxies

849
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:33,210
not only by through how they try to get
to us it also means with the counter

850
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:34,620
measures have been

851
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,029
there were some real attacks on
dissident sites just the beginning of

852
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:38,500
this year

853
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,950
in a lot of us took some very big hits
and had to do a lot of major

854
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,420
security work and re security work and
we actually had to move our site which

855
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,820
was hosted in hong kong

856
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,300
out over hong kong operations and we had
to move everything because it became

857
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,660
very insecure

858
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,629
and we moved it back to the states up
but this is what shows but we take a

859
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,570
look at October

860
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,690
is really important that huge

861
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,840
John in proxy access was the month

862
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,050
that the lawyer that been working with
us case

863
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,110
up blew open and we had put it on our
site

864
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:18,060
and so people are interested and do
wanna know what's going on

865
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:21,430
this is the key back they can also email
us %uh weekends

866
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:25,230
put up your the curses we got cursed out
a lot

867
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:29,110
and we also got the Public Security
Bureau to us

868
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,230
and said very bad things to us said

869
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,660
you people have a blah blah blah blah
I'm you know sad death to you and all

870
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,569
that stuff and then we actually checked
it out it was from them was allowed to

871
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,130
cool to getting our stuff

872
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,770
not too bad you know magic took the time
to write to us and all that

873
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:48,240
but this is the good to be back we've
also had people for dark email

874
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,240
and on are are male and the forward it
to this

875
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,580
authorities and the CCS and so it's both
to protect themselves to show we got it

876
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,310
but we're gonna turn you in and so the
CCR sorry but he knows that they didn't

877
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,310
know all that stuff

878
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:05,820
and Amy tracks all of that week we track
all of the stuff we get back from China

879
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,610
and we're monitoring it very carefully
and where we could use some more

880
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,600
interesting creative ways to monitor it

881
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,290
and but this is something that the last
one is we like a lot the suspect was by

882
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,300
a lawyer

883
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,450
who said i'm just a humble lawyer in
China I read you

884
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,390
folks regularly where in the seventh
month for the pilot we survive seven

885
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,029
months

886
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,890
its interactive technology project that
means we have to keep coming up with a

887
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,230
different solution every week

888
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:31,490
thanks to bill shine our friends and but
he wrote

889
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:34,660
one blade of grass consent the prairie
ablaze

890
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:39,339
and we love that K

891
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,000
this I'm almost done I'm this

892
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,720
is just to give you one example love
some other differences

893
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:51,070
I think but not but differences that are
important just to reckon I so we can

894
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:52,350
work together

895
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,370
and this is the framework how we have to
think about

896
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:58,680
effectiveness we have to think about it
a little bit differently than I think

897
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,340
then sum up the on that that hackers may
sometimes think about it

898
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,750
and that is we think a bit as very long
term

899
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:10,480
we think that is what is the multiplier
and ripple effect

900
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,520
we can't go in once we've gotta figure
out how we go in and get to stay in

901
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:17,540
how do we keep it safe for the people
that are in the room

902
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,009
that we and two in at work with us lot
other people in the underground networks

903
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:22,100
we work with

904
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,880
and so some other factors we think
others just throw it out is we think of

905
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,570
assessing everything by time and which I
think about comparison with other

906
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,930
similar effects but right now our
project is one of two demos

907
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,800
and we are the only 1i think right now
that's truly an independent project

908
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,710
and we see cover reader feedback we
think that the multiplier effect we

909
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:40,320
think I've

910
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,720
we have to think about costs because and
I'm particularly where costs as

911
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,660
executive director I spent a lot of my
time

912
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:50,549
begging for money I didn't know I was
such a good Baker shameless you know is

913
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,550
just very sad always be begging for
money but that's what I do

914
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:57,210
and I found out that I become shameless
I beg for money and I always people say

915
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,030
what part of no don't you get

916
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:03,430
and I'll say well could could you maybe
think about giving us this much then

917
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,760
and they're going no assay well how that
we come back next month

918
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,060
ago no and I keep doing that so we think
I'll

919
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,830
costs and we think cost because we have
to pay

920
00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,480
for what we do and we really have to pay
the bills

921
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,080
I'm so I just one and with this which is
to first

922
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,400
I'm build on that and say so

923
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,940
let's golan and Bill some really kick
ass

924
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,970
alliances because what we're up against
the so hard

925
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:37,420
and we do that with respect for

926
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,010
and recognition I love that we do have
some different goals

927
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:43,740
and we may have some different
approaches and we may have some

928
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,690
different cultures

929
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:48,350
and we may operate in some very
different material realities

930
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,650
and that while breaking into a room

931
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:55,250
can be a wonderful exercise of freedom
in a statement

932
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:59,200
about kick it open we also think

933
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,240
that for us one other purposes let's
break into the room

934
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,740
and then let's ask the question why and
we need to

935
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,410
answer that question that it has to be
sustainable

936
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,850
we have to be able to empower the people
in the room so that they can kick down

937
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:14,779
those walls

938
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,490
and build other kinds of houses and
rooms and spaces

939
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:22,390
and we have to think about security and
we have to think about pushing the

940
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:23,960
envelope

941
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,820
at the same time how far can we push it
because the consequences for what we do

942
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:32,430
and the people we work with is really
life-and-death

943
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,540
so join us helpless

944
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,550
even out the odds and I'm gone and with
a wish list

945
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:42,170
of what we would need in like in the
wish list is not

946
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:45,300
inclusive incomplete but just to get you

947
