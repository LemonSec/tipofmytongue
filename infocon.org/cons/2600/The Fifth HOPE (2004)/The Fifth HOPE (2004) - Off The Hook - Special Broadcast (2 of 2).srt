1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,130
and from that point I started thinking
well you know how can we do something

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:05,180
like this in the States

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,530
and you know in 1993 I went to was

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,219
AG you or hacking at the end of the
United in the universe

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,260
which was another music a campsite

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,730
think the first one of those I N again
you know

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,279
after four years I said to myself you
know we gotta deal with something like

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,239
this in the States

9
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:27,460
and fortunately next year we were able
to get together with a buncha people

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,739
yourself being one of them and we
organize the first conference here

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,620
hackers on planet earth but you know
none of it would have happened were it

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,540
not for the cops is

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,670
in Europe that that so many of us were
inspired by

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,110
so I think we owe you all great data
thanks for

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:48,110
bring on this conference is getting on

16
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,040
you remember RGH peak like a CAC 40
hours in the parity so

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,670
and Amsterdam yeah parodies owes have to
picture an old church building

18
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:02,760
a complete with with everything the

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,620
what is stained glass windows everything
I and

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,060
completely turned into a rock temple
stones plate there they

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,260
record videos there but we comes there
even though there's only it

22
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,900
it has only act passed you what a
thousand

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,770
1500 people all the big band still like
to come there because that's where they

24
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,380
started

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,660
was one of those things and we
completely turned it into a into a

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,470
hacker thing much like this hotel

27
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,420
89 people really had no idea what this
was about hacking was in

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,320
certainly other microphone cables
through the building all the audio

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,940
cables through the building were

30
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,780
turned into Ethernet cables are serial
cables or whatever we use back ten

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,170
whose was weird it was funny yeah now
your plan something for next year

32
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,479
tells me about that I'm were still in
the in this Jan

33
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,770
planning phase we're still working on
what it is exactly that we do we have no

34
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,700
location for it yet but we do we do plan
to do something next year

35
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,820
in the summer in Holland just don't know
what yet great every four years

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,450
something happens now and then on the
other every four years

37
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,899
something comes in Germany and every two
years one year before us every two years

38
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,420
there's there's something in German

39
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,299
yes or two restaurants a but basically

40
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:19,080
you're next in Holland and we'll have
another conference in 2006 most likely

41
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,610
than

42
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,209
2007 will be Germany 2008 us again in
2009 interview in

43
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:28,650
something like something like that
there's there should have been a long

44
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,450
galactic cycle developing here if you
have a country if you have a city or

45
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,190
country

46
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,950
that is under your control and you wish
to do hacker conference feel free to

47
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,620
break this cycle and somehow do cool
stuff that is not open to any country so

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,860
yeah please you know

49
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,470
Togo whatever this come to us and her
homework assignment is to come up with

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,100
an algorithm that exploits this the
Olympics in the presidential election

51
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,690
I was wondering what would happen if we
had scheduled a conference for say

52
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,690
our I don't know why late August in this
hotel and we have done it we've done it

53
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,700
before the republicans had that decided
when to schedule there's an

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,660
you know next time already been
preempted 2008 I think I'm gonna try n

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,918
schedule it said it really messes up
their schedule

56
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:19,919
the ultimate hack

57
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,390
now that they'll just kick ass at has
compressed

58
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,310
you know there are republicans like
floating around the heart yes of course

59
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,299
of the republicans come in to check the
phone lines because they've installed a

60
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:31,599
whole bunch of phone lines here too

61
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,579
for the convention so they unlike ours
theirs might work yeah there's a working

62
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,790
now I remember during setup yesterday
was like a spectacle

63
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,828
yeah it is the republicans were here
never gonna take a picture

64
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:46,889
all these people suits fat people it's
it's these are the phone outlets mark

65
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:47,799
RNC

66
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:50,609
don't tamper their with them don't do
anything with them they are for the

67
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,120
republican their booby-trapped

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,419

78
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,820
well dan Morgan was here he was on a
panel before talking about

79
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,930
when corporations attack I along with
punch for the people that have had

80
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,110
similar tales

81
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,220
while and well I mean that was

82
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,570
I was quite a story what happened to him
here and so am i watch news

83
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,400
and was driven out of business by powers
that be

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,770
as great to have him here in New York to
we can tell a story to

85
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,159
a receptive audience their life stories

and we're trying to be as many them to
you as possible so that's

87
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:02,389
that's one Adam Chur to be more
throughout the weekend once again you

88
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,570
can see is video tomorrow provided it
makes it here three amtrak

89
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,449
min see exactly what he was doing so
burn it tells me that this video this is

90
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:09,990
the

91
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,389
director pirate video 9

92
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,930
DBS hack again spoke about this earlier
today

93
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,969
I it's a it's a really interesting
documentary the covers their cat and

94
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:21,940
mouse game

95
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,690
that was going on between a satellite TV
hackers and DirecTV and other

96
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,880
sadly programming providers I

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,669
technology got countermeasures in
electronic counter counter measures

98
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,830
electronic counter counter counter
measures went back and forth back and

99
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,199
forth DirecTV figure out some way to
prevent people from

100
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,500
downloading a signal in secret thing it
and

101
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
hackers would figure out a way around
that and then they neither

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,419
countermeasures went back and forth

103
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,680
and did a great job documenting this
this whole

104
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,820
saga and it's very entertaining tilly is
a headlight human

105
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,039
story behind it as well

106
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:03,120
and that video an hour-long

107
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,449
which were initially here tomorrow and
it the yet in a movie from

108
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,719
is a is part of what God and Morgan
shutdown

109
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:15,139
on by DirecTV owned by General Motors in
Hughes aerospace

110
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:19,169
on and there is nothing in the video
that specifically said their

111
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,750
how to now how did how to

112
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,570
receiver satellite programming without
paying for it was documentary that

113
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,210
explained

114
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,940
what was going on in the community and
it's really fascinates everybody who's

115
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,770
here should

116
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,960
to try to catch this film Tomorrow in
the movie room in the schedules posted

117
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,779
on the door

118
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:39,260
this is something that can happen to
anybody really anybody that

119
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,279
messes with that information and

120
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,289
gets a large corporation angry for just
saying the truth

121
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:50,570
what's interesting is that corporation a
DirecTV

122
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,870
was not even a an American company I was
american companies use in

123
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,320
%ah a a lot of companies that were they
were doing this we're in Canada and

124
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,810
alotta companies were raided in Canada
at the behest

125
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,150
love in american corporation who got
their world

126
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,430
Canadian Mounted Police to to raid
dozens and dozens of people who were

127
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,229
hacking the satellite signal and it was
really interesting precedent

128
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,580
pointed out the film was at the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police

129
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,599
themselves were out watching DirecTV

130
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,020
I on their side of the border with
Turkey be specifically

131
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,240
prohibited so what's going on le

132
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,409
interesting irony in the film it's worth
checking out okay now be taking place in

133
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,169
the movie room rackmount house a little
more about moving again

134
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:38,359
well I mean it says running 24 hours the
schedules on the door on a lot of

135
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,510
interest in documentaries

136
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,149
I'm watching a lot of things I've never
seen before I'm having a great time with

137
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:44,820
it so I think all you would too

138
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,750
showing I have the back open so you can
see what's going on if it catches your

139
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,430
eye come in sit down for a bit

140
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,209
I saw a lot of people crowded by the
entrance looking in

141
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:58,260
but they seemed afraid to go in don't be
afraid you know they're joined by

142
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,380
North Korean propaganda films before and
they're in English for some reason I i

143
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,419
when I like this pollen brought this
over may I enjoyed it

144
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,959
the scene at the parade in North Korean
Pyongyang with one

145
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,180
million people marching it's just
awesome

146
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,490
miss coordination with the head there
are holding up different color thing

147
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,349
that other flags and over in perfect
synchronization

148
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,349
I don't that enthusiasm that

149
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,360
you know the kind of enthusiasm that we
should have people coming for the film

150
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,690
to see that

151
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,110
sigh its it's a lot of fun are so yes
not just hacker films it's all kinds a

phenomenal job in working you know 12

176
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,860

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,260
getting microphones and sound and the
picture working

182
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,540

183
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,800
ability that I certainly don't have and
so I'm extremely happy that there are

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,110
people out there willing to

185
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,389

wants to see several programs in the B
track

192
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,700
and would not mind running cameras while
they're doing it

193
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,829
and had has experience running
camcorders well that would be great

209
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,180

into this takes months a planning and

211
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,959

magazine for the few weeks now been

233
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,730
working at a desk job the archives

234
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,420
shows get me through the day I laugh I
cry I shake my fist at the MPAA and the

235
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,710
rest corporate America

236
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,430
I'm over in Vancouver Canada so whenever
I hear about the laws you guys are

237
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,620
charged with breaking I will come up in
the web since most the time I don't know

238
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,680
how they would apply to me here in
Canada

239
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,050
so thanks for making my mental gears
turn

240
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,210
sign Lee and I could give others like
this all the time people

241
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,029
are just happy to hear us on the radio
and listen to us in the

242
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,050
all kinds different places all around
the world and again

243
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,510
you know having us on the net having us
being broadcast

244
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,310
over the over the web I various other
radio station sure rates getting out to

245
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,230
more and more people that makes all the
difference

246
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,529
when we started the show back in 1988 we
just had the radio station and

247
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,170
you know its consulates say we just had
because at a big deal

248
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,570
50,000 while radio station of New York
City and in the middle the commercial

249
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,440
bank

250
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,140
that's a lot of people right there but
since then due to the efforts of

251
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,279
many people like the people here we've
reach so many more

252
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,370
and has made such a big difference
because we can get calls from London

253
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,279
from Australia and from

254
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,640
all over the place that we never could
have reached before

255
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,180
and the porch of actual you were
instrumental back in 1997

256
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,660
in getting us to actually start
archiving our shows

257
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,500
and bringing real audio into the picture
is never done that before we just

258
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,220
broadcast the state that the show on the
station

259
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,060
and that was it you know you could
listen to a show in the past

260
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,100
what was the process leading up to all
that had it was more or less

261
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,630
back in beyond hoping we we have beyond
hope the puck building

262
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,839
Houston Street arm somebody wanted

263
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,140
a high-end computer to to encode for
real audio system

264
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,180
to bring this stream over to another's
distribution server and we can

265
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,360
everybody could hear the conference live
it was great idea

266
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,860
and I had a brand-new 100 megahertz
machines

267
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,130
so I donated and we ran the stream of

268
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,140
and then when the conference is over
said hey I can do this for the reassure

269
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,300
week and so I did arm with

270
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,899
another group com my group engines group
is

271
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,940
basically the same group of people has
been constantly new people coming in all

272
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,760
people

273
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,920
i'd and basically we had a I think the
first

274
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,620
first couple weeks we had forty listener
capacity and we actually got

275
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,120
thirty or forty listeners mom up to

276
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,420
I think when I stop doing it back when
we start doing the film

277
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,140
was we had a class about 450 RealAudio

278
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,439
listeners harry just starting with the
mp3 of course now

279
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,580
RealAudio is a lot less cool wiser their

280
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,380
more cool things instead every lawyer
home so we've gone

281
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,610
from real audio to mp3 but yeah that was

282
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,709
that was new stuff for us new stuff for
BA I to

283
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,770
you suffer radio shows in general I
think it's indicative

284
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,010
the whole hackers spirits just come up
to somebody say you know

285
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,540
I can do this I can make this happen
that we haven't done yet

286
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,149
we didn't think we could too easily and
upper cap made it happen

287
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,790
and then more people started helping out
and that pretty much brought us to

288
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,069
the point where you know the radio
station streams all the time and

289
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,180
we stream all the shows and we have an
incredible archive shows

290
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,149
and I I like occasionally just putting
on old shell from say ten fifteen years

291
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:28,040
ago and just

292
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,350
hearing how things were different and
how the from

293
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,010
systems and a different when you connect
calls you've heard all kinds of things

294
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,459
you don't hear any more different

295
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:40,730
kinda rains clicks on the way that the
connection are they overall quality of

296
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,000
online

297
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,580
so a lot has happened and I'm sure I
will happen in the years ahead

298
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,630
so it's it's good to be paying attention
so that you know when things are

299
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,470
changing

300
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,690
and playing with technology as much as
possible

301
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:56,620
on atmosphere and he is been putting
together the network

302
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,890
downstairs and working tirelessly

303
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:07,329
on

304
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,230
thanks I'm

305
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,900
I've been up since 11 a.m. yesterday so
I

306
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,230
have pretty decent bring capacity but my
I'm losing

307
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,049
motor skills my mouth so I don't also
all right now and

308
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:23,129
I don't usually talking do public
speaking that well either sell

309
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,910
we'll see how this goes the

310
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,280
big news is that I'm after abouts

311
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,610
I guess eight hours of constant
pestering and social engineering by

312
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,929
my gosh check she be read

313
00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,090
horizon and MCI and actually dealing
with the

314
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,639
t1 issues we were having and as a about
half an hour ago we have

315
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
both team lines up and running are right
the

316
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,429
on we all know its support to the geeks

317
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:59,350
yeah it's amazing how every time no
matter how far in advance we plan it out

318
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,510
horizon always comes through in the end
and screws it up well that's what they

319
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,000
do

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,140
you know it seems that way that's why
the European hacker comes work so well

321
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,510
because they don't have Verizon

322
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,690
try to buy a good t1 briseno area

323

actually got to peace and quiet for the

326
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,280
last six hours

327
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,690

magazine in meeting up with DIRECTV

329
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,110

330
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,030
occurs and newsletters a good things a
and we talked about selling corruption

331
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,918
was circumvented DIRECTV's been hacked

332
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,240
before was DirecTV sky the sky in the UK

333
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,260
use the same smart card encryption I

334
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,450
I don't think hey you know anything
about smart cards a

335
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,179
my girl at a conference said badges were
smart cards

336
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:07,710
hey there yet they were flying out there
in the well with the show area I

337
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,289
remember that

338
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:12,440
but anyway we talked about when we talk
about what happened to me I was soo to

339
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,770
death by DirecTV

340
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,168
they won a million dollar judgment the
only way they wanted

341
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:21,059
is I ran outta money and

342
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:25,158
there put an end to that print
publication by the way you guys

343
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:29,620
always take care your print never let
your mind get caught up too much

344
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,690
in computer news what can happen to a
website tomorrow morning at the All Good

345
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,620
good ol US government wanted you're in a
bit it's gone this man sells print me

346
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,040
the same thing I did

347
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,879
print media is the truth if it's written

348
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,240
as well as his it shows up on the due
date

349
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,720
and the government is not taking down
the band with

350
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,120
to eliminate it because they don't like
what someone is saying

351
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,860
always support 2600 they do one helluva
great job and I'm very proud of the man

352
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,650
you on the team

353
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,909
everybody involved is a real great job
thank you very much for your efforts

354
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:10,169
%ah

355
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,700
its

356
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,890
it's really it's really an honor to have
people I can hear

357
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,159
understand the importance speaking up
and

358
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,169
very often pay very dear price for that
I think

359
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,309
well here too to support him and support
each other and

360
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,139
in those endeavors you know manual right
after you made that statement about

361
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,460
price and sucking the ISDN line went
dark

362
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,970
for 60 seconds it's back

363
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,340
are actually but what would you say
they're listening a

364
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,658
work by the way we should talk about how
we connected tonight to the radio

365
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,419
station Mike you wanna tell us something
about this

366
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:48,100
sure we don't actually have an ISDN I'll
so we have

367
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,860
to analog phone lines is we're using one
analog phone line in this new device

368
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,740
called the

369
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,440
zephyr export which is basically it's a
a fan the modem

370
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,280
with some my AC cortex which is sorta
like mp3 only different

371
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,280
the so I'll plan on the analog phone
line were transmitting

372
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,649
our radio quality audio to the radio
station

373
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:13,820
and it when it works it works pretty
well it's that this is the second time

374
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,399
tonight that we've had a about a minute
where we have to go but over the machine

375
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:18,020
kit

376
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,840
up but it's pretty neat technology

377
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,850
yeah 1997 we is every unit

378
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,950
we had ISDN line installed at the park
building downtown

379
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,559
and we connected to the ISDN number

380
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,168
at the radio station I but this time
we're using regular pots lined

381
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,970
thats that's a first for us to be able
to do that and they also means that

382
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,850
theoretically

383
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,480
anybody with the phone line can get at
them how the sound if they connect to

384
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,799
an ISDN line so it's getting to the
stage where

385
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:51,429
phone sound I think improve quite a bit
and

386
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:54,809
I could have you on FM magic talk to
someone in the phone it as a salad on

387
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:55,950
the phone I think one day

388
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,530
that will be the ancient past where you
now you sound like you know the Sprint

389
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,158
sound as fun talking about

390
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,159
that will be a thing of the past and
sound like you talking somebody right

391
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,460
next to you

392
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,139
okay I guess server ready to to take
some questions are people while lineup

393
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:15,909
and you know make like you calling in I
guess that means rebel

394
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:19,799
the first cell stay right next to the
microphone there

395
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,940
I'm gonna be one more later before a
hold the microphone for the form I start

396
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,929
writing up

397
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:28,850
on I used to get telemarketing calls
from a live person till I signed up for

398
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,179
the Do Not Call list

399
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,260
ever since I did that the white people
stop calling and I now get calls from

400
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,429
recordings

401
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:38,130
I have anonymous call rejection and call
interceptor my line but that doesn't

402
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,290
work because I get calls on my caller ID
with the number

403
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:45,570
802 03 for 7800

404
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,210
I may have to change my number I tried
call trace and that didn't work

405
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,700
signed John from Brooklyn well john what
you're seeing is manipulation

406
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,399
caller ID data where basically any
number can be sent

407
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:03,100
and it's a number 034 exchange cannot
beat I'll see you can call them back

408
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,730
are they are sending the probably the a
Ricardo to which I believe is for months

409
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,770
few times are you to day one

410
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:14,440
802 instrument alright i0 to the
Caribbean

411
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,230
now that's 802 is somewhere yeah 809 is
a Caribbean my question is a test

412
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,429
now 802 is remind okay so probably

413
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:25,639
the telemarketer is in vermont summer on

414
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:29,820
and they're they're they're messing with
with the rest to the numbers but wait

415
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,049
what use is a telemarketing call if you
can contact them

416
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:36,549
I mean how it's gonna buy a car phone
and talk to them by their product when

417
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,760
they annoy you

418
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,840
they don't wanna be ignored by you

419
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,330
but when we get telemarketing numbers we
generally spread them around so

420
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,820
you can buy them whenever you want and
I'm sure a lot of people want to do that

421
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,439
on this kinda thing is is tough because
they are sending caller ID

422
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,049
but you know the call tracing is not a
rip off and I mention the child star 57

423
00:23:57,049 --> 00:23:59,000
or something paid out fifty for

424
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,520
the right to report them or something
like that you don't have to go that

425
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,679
route you can go there call nice pure
that

426
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,730
they're required to maintain and I'm

427
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,790
and the other for free and I'll track
down the number that called you and make

428
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,510
them stop

429
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,240
alright sticker first listener phone

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,379
here and and assign a yeah and then will
publicize at throughout the whole

451
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,399
conference on people now to come to your
talk

452
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:27,080
to avoid you talk it's maybe go ahead I
notice that

453
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,299
you can bill calls to your cell phone I
have a 91 79

454
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:35,240
449 exchange and I could just go to any
verizon phone here in New York City area

455
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,889
and bill a third number call a collect
call to my cell phone

456
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:42,169
can only work on local call not
long-distance

457
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:47,540
you can do third number billing to your
cell num right 917 449 exchanged

458
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,600
work for companies that 917 449 Sprint
PCS

459
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,760
just so sorry to hear that information
at it and I know it is from company is

460
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,059
Sprint PCS ideas now also you

461
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:01,149
everybody's scared ass away from that I
know but

462
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:05,230
okay bill calling cards don't work
anymore when you used to be able to use

463
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,919
a realistic on this for a second so what
you're saying is a moment Sprint PCS far

464
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:09,850
maybe

465
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,450
susceptible to somebody third-party
billing just like offer acceptance thing

466
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,169
is that they can be called

467
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:19,540
my cell phone can be called collect I
could accept a collect call

468
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,820
I I can chart let's say information
information cost money from Verizon

469
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,918
payphones

470
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:30,040
the call 0 area code two one two or
anywhere in the New York City area

471
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,030
and then 555 1212 you bill it to your
cell phone

472
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,940
pick up your cell phone accept the
charges but don't you wanna paying for

473
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,990
it and ultimate

474
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,490
now I've been doing this for away that's
the other party did mention you don't

475
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,639
actually get the bill

476
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:47,309
no all less important little fact there

477
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:51,440
okay

478
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,279
shear is

479
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,259
that is something y'know back when Kevin
was in prison we we figure out a way

480
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:57,449
that he could call

481
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:01,239
Kevin you know how we did this are you
would call my cell phone some if you

482
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,789
look at freedom downtime you'll see I'm
talking to my cell phone

483
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:07,429
and you don't want people to do that
right next to the call cell phones from

484
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:08,969
prison to get the car collect

485
00:27:08,969 --> 00:27:12,190
know what I used to do is have somebody
three-way with on

486
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,409
right so because I call somebody like a
link or collect

487
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:19,629
and then have a personal call three way
and they're like that they

488
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:24,159
no no no it's actually a rule violation
I got busted for a couple times in the

489
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,539
you know the right show up and they give
you like extra duty

490
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:29,969
we have a thing called a shot for doing
so and

491
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:34,089
get relief route 1 that's not something
the terminology the Bureau of Prisons a

492
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:35,190
call the shop

493
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,969
motorcycle incident report it rather
unlike its a little

494
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:42,829
welcome to the jungle out there so are
to your cell phones

495
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,099
have to suffer anymore arm yachts
differently

496
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,799
the frown on it upper and I knew

497
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,899
that when I was in custody ace to
monitor my calls all the time

498
00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:56,949
and I city three ways all the time but
they didn't do anything about it

499
00:27:56,949 --> 00:28:01,389
I think you're more interested did in
what the conversation was going to be

500
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:05,799
rather than the rule being violated we
use that do that regularly with Bernie

501
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,039
was a prison he would call

502
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,609
me remember bernie yes I we call a

503
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:14,418
some special number that was set up with
nine you call or go you called me

504
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:18,479
which must be revealing all this the
well the statue limitations has run out

505
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,159
I hope

506
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,539
yeah I don't know if you are a great I
the only one who could probably get in

507
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:23,049
trouble

508
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:28,229
our cover your ears so you would call a
number that we do what exactly call

509
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:30,109
special number that I think would be
forwarded

510
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:34,689
to I studio we did it we did enjoy

511
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,839
and now after her to call collect if
that's the only way you can make calls

512
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:38,589
from prison

513
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:42,569
most prisons anyway so on I had to make
these collect calls in

514
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:45,809
I'm in almost a week really kept me
going. calling almost every weekend off

515
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:46,639
the hook getting

516
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:49,999
be back in support from people really
kept me alive frankly we had two wines

517
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:53,359
at what we did was get one like we
called the special studio number the

518
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,759
other one you call this collective and
we just

519
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,319
through it and work very well there was
a period I don't know if it was you

520
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,139
fiber or Kevin

521
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,359
where you could call a cell phone
directly

522
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,759
collect and we would never get the bill

523
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,690
yeah I call that was Kevin yeah 7 sonar
you collect a few times and

524
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,440
for some reason even get the bill I
don't know why I mean you know I would

525
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,549
gladly pay the bill

526
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:19,609
but apparently they their billing system
wasn't set up

527
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:22,908
that they could handle that some reason
and then I got turned off

528
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,099
some interesting when I was in when I
first got arrested in Raleigh North

529
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,859
Carolina 9530

530
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:31,958
put me in this County Jail call in
Smithfield North Carolina

531
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:37,119
and somehow they have these private
companies I would put in these prison

532
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,179
type telephones

533
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:42,749
and one of the other guys accidentally
dialed like a 113

534
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:46,709
in a drop them into a dial tone and from
a dial tone they can call anywhere in

535
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:47,549
the world for free

536
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:52,289
right so everybody was using it
excitement because I was using it was to

537
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:53,489
start a nuclear war

538
00:29:53,489 --> 00:29:57,249
but if anyone else was easier its public
in a free phone call so I

539
00:29:57,249 --> 00:30:01,889
I was called a lot hackneyed in discover
the 113

540
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:06,989
because I decided it would be would be a
good idea to be playing on the telephone

541
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,479
yes

542
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:12,089
up did you program the 113 did you set
it up

543
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:15,408
I don't think the statue of limitations
as well

544
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,989
okay Nextel Corp talk about that I

545
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:23,099
next well in other questionable make it
passes people waiting I'd also like to

546
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:23,749
mention that

547
00:30:23,749 --> 00:30:27,319
their 800 numbers that are being taken
over by cycling in other words if you

548
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:27,899

552
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:41,489

553
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:45,190
on my talk tomorrow a on nichols' to a

555
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:49,789
questions

556
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:56,789
yeah good alright next expressed in hi I
am A hartman from Louisville Kentucky

557
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,399
now I was wondering out what are some
other specials on the freedom downtime

558
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,299
DVD

559
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,979
specifically do you have that one
screensaver looking

560
00:31:06,979 --> 00:31:11,200
thing with all the media icons arm way
I'm not sure what you're asking what

561
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,399
when you were talking about the media
there's a buncha

562
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,769
I want the media exactly

563
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:21,950
for freedom's greatest hope for Sun yet
what what are you asking how we did ABC

564
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,959
wrote to you have like that as a

565
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:27,339
always a screensaver in savers that's
actually really good idea which I never

566
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:27,839
thought

567
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,069
for now we we did that inside ability
does

568
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:34,579
those an effect on in there within
that's like screensaver

569
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:37,969
but that's a good idea as a good idea
but you know so many them

570
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:41,019
consolidate since then it'll be a lot
smaller than it was you know all these

571
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:42,389
different entities

572
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:46,099
but yeah it's a it's it's a cool effect
because they're there are love real good

573
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:49,259
specials on a disc in the one I really
do want to point out because it was

574
00:31:49,259 --> 00:31:52,989
actually really amazing our friend
Bernie s your nearly took out the head

575
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:53,869
of the Mafia

576
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:57,159
Philadelphia got a story on a DVD

577
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,799
in Telerik told is re great version
history I don't wanna tell here because

578
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,889
it took half an hour to do it before

579
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:08,249
but there's this half-hour session any
on our singer Alesha meows those hang on

580
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:08,879
every word

581
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:11,950
and you really have to see it it's on
the second this special

582
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,789
I think a the second is as long as the
movie itself isn't it yet somehow we

583
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:17,329
have something like three hours

584
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,479
up deleted material or any material we
didn't use

585
00:32:20,479 --> 00:32:23,940
and saw that is just priceless but had
nothing to do with the subject matter

586
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,239
I for instance week that this whole tour
foundation imaging

587
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,409
in california because we were friends
are some people over there

588
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:33,279
and it is to this on this incredible
tour in there the talking all their

589
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,839
high-tech equipment which

590
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:38,769
no feel he is now high-tech by today's
standards and how it takes like

591
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:41,779
hours and hours and hours to render a
single frame

592
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:45,690
and just things that have changed so
much I mean TV shows were being rendered

593
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,859
on amigas back then

594
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:51,809
and now you have the equivalent of
praise doing it

595
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:56,819
its its on believe what is going on the
store in seeing how things changed

596
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:59,950
and so we included there really had
nothing to do with Kevin story

597
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,309
we've done that anyway and saved for for
now

598
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:06,369
thank you right question

599
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:10,019
I am i come from model or Canada
absolutely

600
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:15,149
on just a coming Korea's as to what your
thoughts are on the recent ruling

601
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:18,889
of silk and verses me a nice piece

602
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:24,029
so can if some people here don't know is
the cleaning equipment the RIAA

603
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:27,319
and how they were trying to use much as
what are aided was

604
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,658
gather information from the ice he's as
to who was downing

605
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,389
still ongoing day on the ice the spot
this

606
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:38,159
to maintain i've seen users anyone

607
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,859
I remember that now is it as a good
thing I remember also hearing

608
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:44,979
was a Paul Martin the new prime minister
he said that

609
00:33:44,979 --> 00:33:49,289
they're gonna fix this absolute so what
exactly does that mean

610
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:53,039
gonna change the rules on it depends

611
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,739
I mean Martin is no longer majority
government minority government song

612
00:33:56,739 --> 00:34:00,309
their build its I guess it's

613
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:03,529
it's up to the courts decide help people
in Canada generally

614
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:07,289
view what's going on this country
regarding MPAA RIAA like anything

615
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:10,719
is it is it something that day shake
their heads at or something that

616
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,139
is a few months to lay out their

617
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,720
on own we get the news prairie quickly
and you get your news as well

618
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,059
a tan our views on inter

619
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:26,440
being late on were a bit scared been

620
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,899
because oftentimes Canada will often USA

621
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:33,250
what I mean is a is the latest bars it
is is delayed

622
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,839
in limine you're using year year and a
half behind

623
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:40,518
Spurs policies against but

624
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:45,779
I'm not sure I mean a lot things could
change the next year's

625
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:49,018
so do you feel safe downloading music up
there absolutely you do

626
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:52,129
absolutely I understand have reading
policy

627
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:56,268
from I use Rogers internet which is a
cables to

628
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:59,720
on and the policy then they do do not
share any

629
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,460
the public information with any for any
reason

630
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,720
so it's pretty sick of course the
written policy often yes from what they

631
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,099
actually do

632
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,119
it does busy boulevard I'm asking you
questions what's true

633
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,250
that the MPAA have any kind of power
over

634
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,420
people there as far as as

635
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,420
none whatsoever none whatsoever no they

636
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:30,009
they are

637
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:33,469
I guess against the the MPAA's

638
00:35:33,469 --> 00:35:36,910
they have sorted a branch of it

639
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:41,210
was the so can which is equivalent to
the MPAA was someone founded by

640
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:46,469
the MPAA but aside from that day they
are full independence

641
00:35:46,469 --> 00:35:53,210
arce neighbors to the north thank you
could

642
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,219
because a lot of Canadians at the school
I know you

643
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:00,180
I am risk taker on from Germany and
risk-taker here that the translation

644
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,250
freedom downtime

645
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:08,250
into German on the DVD

646
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,660
you mentioned earlier how author my
watch magazine was shut down

647
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,038
how that could happen to anybody um do
you have an explanation why the

648
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:21,450
have happened 2600 yet

649
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,739
you know then what do you think we do
for this kinda thing

650
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:31,359
you been lucky I I have a lot of rent
action actually yet

651
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,799
it's a wonderful thing as a matter fact
if anything unlike myself

652
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:38,809
when I got popped I was doing talk radio

653
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:41,910
did a show every Wednesday night about
satellite you know the victor

654
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,930
packing topic there a reddish every
Wednesday night

655
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,210
it's amazing how this acting magazines
radio show it

656
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:52,380
namely anyway are

657
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,079
I was kinda in niche packing business
satellite TV is really new cheats

658
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,099
very small so you're actual subscriber
base

659
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,109
probably hasn't grown to attend the
years it didn't go to attend the years

660
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,710
the this is a different type the vacuum
here's a very diversified

661
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,770
2200 very diversified I wasn't everybody
promised money

662
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,609
and God bless a few that did donate im
pretty substantial I'm into the tube

663
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:22,578
five thousand dollars in we need about a
million dollars to win anything

664
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:26,219
but anyway we someone did if he ever
does get in trouble

665
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:32,029
reach deep protect with you have because
with his print media is gone

666
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:35,730
who's the next one is there any more
that do you

667
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,599
with 2600 has done for everybody here I
don't think so

668
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,420
you know I have to say week we were
attacks back in 2000

669
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,890
by the MPAA sued us

670
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:51,069
simply for having to the CSS code on our
website

671
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:55,859
and I'm you know it was scary but I was
never really afraid because so many

672
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,969
people were there supporting us

673
00:37:57,969 --> 00:38:01,719
are not least of which course being the
Electronic Frontier Foundation

674
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,910
who stood up and provide us with lawyers
and defense not like anything

675
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,098
and while we lost the case we lost the
appeal

676
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:13,680
I think we we won the war because we got
the word out about the Digital

677
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,969
Millennium Copyright Act

678
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:18,250
now he say the MCA a lot of people know
about it

679
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,270
and nobody knew about it before that so
I think they'll be a better candidate

680
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,969
for someone who can actually overturn
this law

681
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,400
in the future am just happy that we were
able to play a part in getting to that

682
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,369
stage

683
00:38:29,369 --> 00:38:32,670
and you know they could have done all
kinds of horrible things to us

684
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,279
by I never doubted for a month there
weren't enough people around

685
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:41,049
to really make a big stink and just be
there when we needed them for

686
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:45,460
whatever emotional support whatever is
needed so you're with an says definitely

687
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,950
makes a lot of sense and I think if we
were focused on just one thing for us

688
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,059
just focused on computers or just
focused on say

689
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:55,980
back to be a massive nothing else yeah
maybe you know

690
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,849
be easier to attack it just for that as
we focus on so many different things

691
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:04,079
as hacking encompasses such a wide
variety of subject matter

692
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,279
you know we all understand the
importance a continuing

693
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,920
even if we don't necessarily understand
the material that's being defended

694
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,180
were presented so I think once we get
all these different people under one

695
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,899
roof

696
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,910
we agreed that this country thing is
good

697
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:25,009
that's a lot of strength there I think
we see that around today

698
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:28,440
yesterday a quick question we talked
about the magazine we talked about the

699
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,390
radio show

700
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,500
I'm just curious because this is kind of
a first for me

701
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,920
but how many people are here because the
magazine

702
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,039
and how many people here because the
radio show so just

703
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,950
how many people here because the
magazine's which an opponent curious

704
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,880
people radial and Boyd we can see that
that's something

705
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,039
okay tell who's here because the radio
show

706
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,599
to make you happy to hand out twice fun
though they put

707
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,910
they put up there other hand yes

708
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,319
this guide him well I'd say it's a
little more further

709
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:04,770
further magazine yeah but not their
number see we don't get to see what's

710
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,000
going on we do the radio shows the scan
fun

711
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,359
how people here because the Village
Voice article this week

712
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:15,969
well I I guess recyclers

713
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:19,049
any ideas coming lawyers are in the
audience

714
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,460
us not I I would've got a lynch mob or
anything

715
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,900
for a number of years company are here
because they want to be a groupie for

716
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:32,700
anybody on this panel the heads up yard

717
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,920
ok are you finishing ever the question

718
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,920
thank you okay thanks thanks again

719
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,339
cause I just wanna say a word for all
the people who helped out on a DVD we

720
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,529
had so many people

721
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,480
we have twenty languages that were
translated

722
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,319
on that thing 24 subtitle track to
figure it out

723
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,450
and I'll and basically what that means
is people

724
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,049
and and sometimes more than one person
for language got together and did the

725
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:06,559
translation and

726
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:09,809
you know I don't know the language is so
I don't know how hard it is to imagine

727
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:10,410
Stan

728
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,770
easy task to sit there and go through
all these words and get them right to

729
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,059
make sure that

730
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:19,789
it makes sense in a different language
so I like to think that something is up

731
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:24,140
opens up to a lot more people to enjoy
the film understand agriculture

732
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,779
yes hi I'm Dan from Albany the last
couple of Grand Theft Auto games have

733
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:29,180
featured

734
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,509
voice performances by some and as luck
would have it there's another

735
00:41:32,509 --> 00:41:34,549
installation due out this year

736
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:38,509
can we expect another cameo laszlo I
think you're the person asked this

737
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:39,539
question

738
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,670
out because you're the one responsible
what happened in the past

739
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:48,119
I have no official comment I

740
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,140
what for those who don't know well as
look at Bernie s onto

741

but

745
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,309
I'd love to possess what one of the most
interesting parts of the Grand Theft

746
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:09,279
Auto 3

747
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,430
as far as the part that the liza got me
on was a

748
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,460
were able to hack to get hacked the game
from a stamp on it for

749
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:22,460
I was able to shout free Kevin in the
desert there is anything I can reference

750
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:31,120
that's true a message got into a whole
lot of different like TV shows right

751
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,049
want to show like a hacker in his room

752
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,780
was a TV show in WB that did that but
doesn't speak

753
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,610
know what I was misty well bosley was a
share

754
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,880
yeah publicity I think that was it free
Kevin sticker on the wall and

755
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,640
you know you just see these things in
the weirdest places and you know

756
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,960
sometimes ask permission which you don't
need to do but just

757
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,190
its chemical that message got out I have
to think

758
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,720
no one of the weirdest places I ever saw
the message get out was in AM

759
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,550
a cable and wireless advertisement I
think we printed this

760
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,780
for free phone service so he could call
your friends

761
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,850
and they were saying you know the
person's name and it said

762
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,970
three Kevin meaning you call Kevin for
freedom's the same type facing the same

763
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:11,720
color

764
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,270
and then there is a Forbes magazine was
in there

765
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:20,259
we it always media hacking unintentional
media hacking with the 2600 Forbes

766
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,170
magazine there's a cover 2600

767
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:25,290
probably back in nineteen ninety 8
wasn't

768
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,580
on the subway yeah citicorp's

769
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:33,540
up fifty person like second a subway
stop with you take LED signs along all

770
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,040
the people coming up the escalator

771
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,720
and and there's a sign about their
studies big LED signs about the

772
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,730
escalators and someone hacked into the
signs to say

773
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,420
I the hacker quarterly and what issue
was coming up

774
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,120
and somehow somebody took a picture that
and ended up on all the

775
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,960
made tele-t_v_ new stations in New York
like substance hands hackers hack the

776
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,860
side anyhow

777
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,040
I somebody took that picture and

778
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,110
I happen to know her and I said what do
you call AP and see if they wanna buy a

779
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:03,630
picture

780
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,180
she was a legend photographer she never
sold any other work

781
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,330
so I she whenever a pea in a pod her
photographs

782
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:14,509
so um atticus ended up in the in the
Associated Press said

783
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,680
photo database and force magazine a few
years later put it in some article about

784
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,910
the economy not realizing that is said
to

785
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:23,970
the hacker quarterly and what if I am an
issue it was so

786
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:29,460
just amazing out where this stuff and
sup is the statue limitations over on

787
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,180
that yet

788
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,680
thinking was all coincidence I I don't
know you know

789
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,730
I'm not taking responsibility for
anything okay but just imagine if you

790
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,220
will

791
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,330
someone tried to hack a sign on an
escalator

792
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,009
trying to enter whatever code and typing
in a message

793
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,940
while moving backwards at the same time
you know trying to beat the rush hour

794
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,660
because

795
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,990
sweeney it is the people knew that their
had the rush hours gonna start all these

796
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,040
people to come up the stairs now is the
cover

797
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,540
whoever did it was truly crazy it was
something it was genius

798
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:03,620
Emmanuel like someone asked where I
showed up in that the other I'm on the

799
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,200
radio

800
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,280
so if you stealing a car listening to
the radio which I would never do

801
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,810
to steal a car you have to concentrate
never 200 are very well

802
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,340
the the free Kevin sticker on publicity
was

803
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,430
the worker JJ Abrams who is also created
alias

804
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:22,790
any contacted me when I was a key if I
talk show host

805
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,070
and said hey I i've been watching your
case for all these years and would you

806
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:28,210
come on a Leah simply an FBI agent

807
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:33,030
right saw the to kinda be like get back
at the government so

808
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,160
the cast me as a CIA agent in very small
role in

809
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,710
the fifth episode but that's why put the
free Kevin bumper sticker on the show

810
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,350
was critical here after a life that
question

811
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,890
I do love occur

812
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:51,020
key from west side to if I made
aggressed

813
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,290
to caller ID quest has been ripping
people off for 295 a month

814
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,080
with think all securities screen you can
break through it

815
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,100
with the complicated AXA up diverting

816
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,660
or using a calling card and of course
moving your caller ID

817
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,819
the same time and also what

818
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,340
was comin what the community

819
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,290
common agreement what was flex Anne is
now

820
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:19,540
as come out that it is see

821
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,029
and call part number you can hear all
about that the paltry do it

822
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,030
31 so it's it's changed things change

823
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,940
that's up from strong carlson's mothers
can you just tell us for the

824
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,110
people listening maybe people who don't
know up diverting to set an example what

825
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,290
that what that means exactly

826
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:40,270
going to an operator lock locked into a
day many ways

827
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,540
getting them to connect a call for you
that's right and very often they don't

828
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,970
wanna do that they say they

829
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:48,370
they're not allowed to do their they
can't but usually they can I'm special

830
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:52,850
visually impaired and on yet so their
quest has been ripping people off

831
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:58,420
a long long time on and housing ready
for radio what's that people rated 0

832
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,330
comments are likely to 25

833
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,170
the corner was on there I was on mister

834
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:07,510
very good show but a good freaking
information

835
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:14,510
good stuff thank you thank you

836
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,020
leo there's a voice heard on the radio
sometimes yeah you have a question

837
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,740
%uh well as its a few comments and on
his mention the

838
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,430
after burning bassinet see mention it up
to those

839
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,730
call call 1010 28 0

840
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,690
is a teensy long-distance then call a
bill South number which item number

841
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,080
and I'll and when you know both cell
using 1010 to a

842
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,770
you any I it's not from one in san is 92
passed civil cell

843
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:46,130
so the South as he would not be calling
from given any number that's

844
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,700
like you know 10 digits and that's the
any entities and their

845
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,930
which is why I keep getting phone calls
in the White House Situation

846
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,399
everyone always does the white house is
the first number anyone ever programs in

847
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,130
it when they wanna

848
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:00,370
send a face and most recognizable number

849
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:05,790
you know what the number is his
donahue's or something

850
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:12,790
I'm impressed tighter 46 bison anyway
284 561 414

851
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,250
nothing is also the coke cans I was
reading some article that mentioned

852
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,660
coca-cola said they cannot be each the

853
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:24,660
cell the can to the seller on inside
look different and they are heavier than

854
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,250
the normal

855
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:29,300
hands which makes you wonder how its
contest that's random

856
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,560
I mean if the hymie can play

857
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,529
I asked about a microphone your

858
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:39,940
the coke contest is actually on the in
case quantities

859
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:44,380
when you get a case of 12 and Co you
open it up and one at the Cannes

860
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,250
be the special cell phone can and you
can't tell until you've actually open

861
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:49,950
the case

862
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:53,100
which case contains cell

863
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,270
also unleashed to that the for bees

864
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:00,600
did not record your voice it's actually
just random sounds at the produce

865
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,620
and how did know which when you're
speaking to them as a

866
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:07,900
nazis after the sounds and technical and
sound

867
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,920
they respond and but the NSA to know
that that's

868
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,960
that the record your voice and therefore
bannister

869
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,700
well there are actually concerned that
someone could could have hacked the for

870
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,400
a Furby

871
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,420
and change the change the code in it to
actually record classified information

872
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,820
there that paranoid but I guess you
gotta be careful

873
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,930
Mia and a one more question which is %uh

comedian from

899
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,600
auto or arm and calling I actually a

900
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:53,140
been them trying to educate politicians
in Canada make sure that Paul Martin

901
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,549
doesn't

902
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,210
fix this as he said I'm just wanted to
clarify come can i interrupt

903
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:02,320
you have politicians were capable of
being educated I don't understand that

904
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,870
remains to be determined actually want
one of the interesting things is that in

905
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,190
our

906
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:09,600
in our in our recent election on there
was a

907
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,770
you know a roll up to

908
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,230
who would be the leader and are one

909
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:20,000
woman who lost the race was in charge of

910
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,090
hurts Canada who's in charge all the on

911
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:28,610
laws involving a what record companies
are gonna take from you

912
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:31,850
on so she lost she's out not even in the

913
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,400
in there so they owned her and she's not

914
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,010
doesn t power now so I don't software
that powers gonna go and

915
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:42,990
its remains determined but just to be
clear so can't actually

916
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:47,930
not the group that you think it is not
eat median version the REI

917
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:51,790
there's a group called Ceri be Priya

918
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:55,180
and they're the people that are the
Canadian version that near the people

919
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,180
that

920
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,130
have tried to have get again get IP
addresses

921
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:04,370
people a customer information the case
was so can as

922
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:09,000
actually even more bizarre than you'd
imagine the cases so can so can is

923
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,640
a group in Canada that region listens to
radio stations are actually makes the

924
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,990
summit playlists

925
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:17,310
collect money from radio stations and
redistributes artists

926
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:21,270
not independent are it's not real artist
just record companies really

927
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:25,130
but anyway on we've had for some years

928
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:29,330
arm immediate left seen by a blank hard
driver plenty

929
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,990
for a blank the DVD or CD you pay a
certain amount to go so can

930
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:39,030
and so can redistribute it since you
already paid the fine

931
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,300
doing the crime is legal in Canada

932
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,980
that's why you can quote download I put
that in quotes because

933
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,600
on TCPIP doesn't really have any concept
upload and download

934
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,640
all connections and the politicians
don't

935
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,480
yeah that okay so that's a real question

936
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,140
what isn't upload and turns open upload

937
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,160
is illegal in Canada so it's illegal to
rip off an artist in

938
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:09,069
give their stuff away but its ok Hindi

939
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:12,320
to borrow someones the in Copiah

940
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,930
as long as you are downloading not
uploading and

941
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:19,350
if you can figure out the difference
between those two arm

942
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:22,350
you have a future line inaudible

943
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:27,220
okay but just wanted an so we have this
weird situation in Canada

944
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,310
were so can having lost particular
battle

945
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,490
they just fought to get on I

946
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:38,330
information ISP ISP 7 said were common
carriers blah blah blah we don't have to

947
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:38,660
be this

948
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:42,790
out to you so can as say a hot

949
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:45,870
therefore you have to pay us

950
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:50,290
our subscriber for everyone in your
subscribers

951
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,500
so it's kinda weird between a rock and a
hard place if create run

952
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,970
wins we can't download if so can wins

953
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:01,440
we have to pay for the privilege even if
we're not downloading

954
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,450
so we'll see what's gonna happen okay
his ass reminds me something else aside

955
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,220
an example of how

956
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:11,790
government doesn't get it when they make
laws Nats this concept I P portability

957
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:16,820
heard about this where basically you
have the right here I P if you switch

958
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,310
to a different service and I can
everything is just it's gonna it's gonna

959
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,240
break things

960
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,270
like you would not believe it's not like
a phone number

961
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,030
arm I guess we if we had more time to
talk without it reminds me of when

962
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,320
congress said

963
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,740
back but was early part of the century
they legislated that hi

964
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,859
shell equal a a finite number because it
was too complicated

965
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:42,870
to to work with gladys was I read it in
a book

966
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,830
little-known fact they were you look at
our group whose the I believe the

967
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:49,000
Illinois state legislator ago was one in
the ICU is

968
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,130
Kansas Indiana I you're right in the NL
Manager

969
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:56,650
I okay adam has something to add

970
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:59,730
just i on the subject VIP portability
issue

971
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,200
I the provider that brought us the
Internet knack

972
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,300
they have been sued for our customer

973
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,580
that want to keep his address space I
actually filed a

974
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,990
a the testimony CS stating that how you
know this goes against every

975
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:18,940
you know architectural design the
internet and you know

976
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,670
we encourage people to actually you know
know about these cases actually file

977
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:25,790
testimonies with the lawyers you know

978
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:30,270
handling the defense these cases a judge
it says that you can actually

979
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:36,170
or for an IQ test nice now happened to
judge me

980

spoofing the caller yes

1001

it's a has a telephony community
developer community

1003
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,900
and I was able to work with the another
friend of mine and rewrote in XML script

1004
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,310
Voice XML scripts so we can basically on

1005
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:11,120
run this run the script to their side
and where

1006
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,509
able to basically punch into a DTMF the
number that were calling in the number

1007
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,550
we're calling from a car script that's
running

1008
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,560
and their equipment actually use the
caller ID for

1009
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,520
okay what you know exactly what it but
many I don't want to say publicly right

1010
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:25,930
now

1011
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:30,050
for you public talk to be private okay
around okay we have time for just one

1012
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:33,140
more question I also want to welcome
Cheshire catalyst here who has been

1013
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:40,140

1014
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,980
Jeff you to everyone about conference is
correct are yes this is my fifth whole

1015
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:45,750
conference

1016
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:49,680
alright you're a lot two years ago when
I was here actually I got something

1017
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,210
accomplished by being here

1018
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:55,820
are rise in telephone was not be found
under drug resistance

1019
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:59,680
and two weeks after I got back to work
about the time it takes for locals

1020
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,090
to my credible national directory where
I my best friend my

1021
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:07,190
records is causing a lip authorizing
work we could find

1022
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:10,930
their number on so I figure why should I
be the only one

1023
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:14,030
