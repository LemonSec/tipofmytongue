1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:04,970
and they were

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,400
later house duct tape by the front door

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,240
people

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,719
looks on their faces like the world was
coming to an end is on

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,539
our next panelist security liberties
trade-offs in the world terrorism

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,539
it's not about its peers this is a
security expert Bruce Schneier

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,950
on is an author beer

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,400
grams literacy is a nice take

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,400
%ah

10
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,650
this I was at the first hole

11
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:51,410
your ass years here's

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,820
I guess I feel you explain the world

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,340
I'll we went Michael the silly
securities

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,649
class that's going on fundamentally
makes no sense

15
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,920
security guy wander around you wonder

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,640
you know but still here I just

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,729
what's going on here because me when
something doesn't make sense

18
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,450
his still first if he can

19
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,500
me excess to get what's going on here

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,200
rights school and

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,370
this work I just developed

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,920
in the Middle Ages here us up

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,130
as the book now several months ago

24
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,100
size 200 cryptogram sons those I will be
writing

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,210
months so this two cents

26
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,750
way sorry this took is security is
always a trade off

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,479
is no such things here this is actually

28
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,850
really copies we all know this

29
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,979
this to the to look it to our national
sea level

30
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,560
but sadly it people yes my security

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,739
wats give up to get the sample is in the

32
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:19,410
16 other for st. it

33
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,430
his youngsters sent

34
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,360
now mace

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,780
so is this works although makes no sense

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,980
his worth I about

37
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,730
in the powers days that's exactly what
listed

38
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,850
you know it anti-tax

39
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,920
with you from but they entail
surrounding only if

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,220
see the reasonable security truth

41
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,989
even though days see

42
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,280
remember securities always is what you
get

43
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,560
purse which the next

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,070
or all securities and

45
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,090
ass is not will this

46
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,489
base worse here question fastest

47
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:18,810
is worth is

48
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,010
your UK worth he

49
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,290
security consumer gay

50
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,760
to: his 32 we spend a lot

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,108
couple hundred billion dollars fighting
terrorists country

52
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:37,400
are you yet couple hundred billion
dollars

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,070
terrorist if we're growth

54
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,858
if we go I

55
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:50,519
ECC this awful this little

56
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,850
this my guess is that nobody will use

57
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,060
where is not it's because

58
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,120
trail trio money

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,199
ashes his labor issues getting up there

60
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,449

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,650
civil rights privacy unions

72
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,720

for its comments

76
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,360
people two ish

77
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,720
trails it's hard people I and every

78
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,190
creature on this has natural

79
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,930
Trish trails is that its wholly raise

80
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,610
but everybody ace three trails

81
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,110

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,409
this rule this is

91
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,500
which is for poking at Italy's

things the controls control exit
evolutionary service

132
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,649
the is girls they're actually to

133
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:58,519
important differences here

134
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,610
us there's

135
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,620
I think really here me

136
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,730
scales their technology I think

137
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,950
what they do stay short

138
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,170
people this trade-offs based

139
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,339
this iris its

140
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,350
cars dangerous we know that these

141
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,840
says and with me

142
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,030
three interest is the saturates

143
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,600
attack rare downplays

144
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,020
commonplace this

145
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,990
health tell people its whose don't worry
about

146
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,070
did in the news almost

147
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,019
something is

148
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,600
Lori which is why people are afraid to
fly

149
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,249
free to try which white people or

150
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,959
freeing up remained strangers House Inc

151
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,449
children Prado relatives and friends

152
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:06,319
people don't get me the risks because
the media

153
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,519
exacerbates said almost so we think

154
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:15,829
first terrorist is a direct result

155
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:21,360
yet was the play times

156
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,550
like here the year

157
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,839
your for secular rare money this

158
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,749
this witnessed miles articles

159
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:40,970
another problems and will purity so we
see

160
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,639
there the girls your favorite friend
just gets

161
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,259
here I burst debate

162
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:52,079
problem is technology speakers things
work

163
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,870
it's very hard to make trade-offs

164
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,639
on okay systems the slide will get a
free

165
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,040
to take credit card numbers SSL

166
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,110
but not afraid the credit card

167
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,769
way ways it's because

168
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,279
here is strange that's why cyber
terrorists

169
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,970
all is there is

170
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,829
yes her is in my zeal

171
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,230

understands English close

342
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,450
negotiations times will

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,679
all carried out wat they jump

348
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,280
negotiations their forced to do which
want

349
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,300
for the pair it

350
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,710
happens a lot done a lot of things for
me wasted on us

351
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,800
without power negotiation

352
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,010
Patriot Act cast that see here

353
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,400
there's sample ellijay without

354
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,510
bush and by that

355
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,040
governments industries companies

356
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,159
civil organisations people like voters

357
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,490
versace's this

358
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,220
good examples this in the months

359
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,380
11 the want

360
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,700
I want it for a while why media

361
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,650
when we were dating things like the
Eagles corkscrews

362
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,660
European fighters actual must

363
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,290
iight said this for a couple years for
like

364
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,420
installing under baby

365
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,960
the cigarettes to congress the airlines
one say that God

366
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,060
wanted today tops last

367
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,230
clapped the airline said no we lose our

368
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,820
is strasslers I cost to

369
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,750
that conciliation his

370
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,050
travelers me themselves powerful as
Spurs

371
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:29,310
and this detail basic

372
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,740
example is thank their quiche

373
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,540
checks thanks to their

374
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,810
prices on ships announce under some very

375
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,020
because from the

376
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,780
thanks perspective if the customer
doesn't notice the

377
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,420
his was

378
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,750
was the day here so the

379
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,770
forces customers

380
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,120
to look at the checks if they want
that's here

381
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,990
now source from a utilitarian radio

382
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,570
raises security police cost this clearer
efficiently

383
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,620
dead you know with some thought you get
18

384
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,870
process pretty well have Texas

385
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,510
for for check verification thanks do but
the banks

386
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,700
agenda does doesn't make

387
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,470
bank just be less

388
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,630
do it because

389
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,620
is the fact that you compare that with
the with down's checks

390
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:39,810
issue down check thanks so the bank

391
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,530
looks check that's it she just steal it

392
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:50,920
because their needs I think for ladies
in their lives

393
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,700
this actually interesting 1 here's a
sample

394
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,300
a security measure sold book is
terrorist

395
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,960
which actually airlines race over the
decades

396
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,520
their all suspicious that the government

397
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,430
most airlines the airlines and flight
everyone a

398
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,590
what we think it or years the only 180

399
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,170
light is the i th the reason is it's all

400
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,870
a airlines the reselling

401
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,150
non-refundable tickets they had a

402
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:30,560
problem people reselling tickets

403
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,720
the song feature but

404
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,550
pretend the government may terrorist
example

405
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,430
jizzed so useless

406
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,480
you almost no

407
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,060
control Oracle's security in our life

408
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,570
security test

409
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,250
just this its work powerless

410
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,520
two that rose here me

411
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,690
here hi I'll properly like is to get

412
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,620
world power negotiations Christian
Windows

413
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,330
I walking airline security

414
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,360
is the wrong time to negotiate is
anyone's

415
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,640
comment security while the search

416
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,200
knows is

417
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,710
around the house

418
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,529
this is Society Nass a-sixes

419
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:36,580
security when you airlines

420
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,389
curious first searching you is not or
lugosi

421
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:45,570
he's effectively a college he has no
power to negotiate

422
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:49,939
and the most negotiate is the
marketplace

423
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,599
can't fly water no worse here airlines

424
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,799
the background checks or less secure
it's there less

425
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,960
there is in the marketplace the
airline's

426
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,320
here but like there is yes so we're
sorry worst

427
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,399
get yes anyone ago she

428
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:18,299
we can't do it later in life not
previous

429
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,239
New York I went into a hotel II

G

441
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:11,009
always negotiation miles that this

442
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:14,450
way to said yes carry is

443
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:19,509
change the environment to change the
system

444
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:23,789
under which people negotiate to CiCi's

445
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:27,269
players their monthly accomplish this

446
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:31,039
I use the form things that various

447
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,580
uses look a little he's decided like

448
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,129
thank you its see cases as

449
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:41,229
s pornos and their needs

450
00:29:41,229 --> 00:29:44,700
turn years government intervention

451
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,979
laws regulations towards

452
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:53,139
EU want to improve

453
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:56,559
security you make a list

454
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,009
past hitler's think you that she teaches

455
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:08,009
players his illegal it is a legal thing
to mind frontline leaderless

456
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,479
likely to do it trade-off you're gonna
make

457
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:16,690
the weather your lawn will be different
you think you might go to jail

458
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,729
do it way

459
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:23,190
do that towards still environmentalists

460
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,460
for these trio is we are there

461
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,289
capital planning the river seemed like
downs

462
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:34,269
who cares musical trio it go dancing
this

463
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:37,739
you certainly his said

464
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:44,739
not 3 it the overall to me this is the
best way to braced security if there

465
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:48,849
were major

466
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:53,070
this action suit against microsoft for
security damewood

467
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:58,908
mike says much here's our company as
long as she's pretty insecure is

468
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:03,220
here believes here if you want to be

469
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,229
cheaper to be secure where the waste
that

470
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:09,249
is liabilities so

471
00:31:09,249 --> 00:31:12,619
with these Haas did not lighter

472
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:16,210
of business services your politics
always there

473
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,029
russians government

474
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:24,849
there's the market forces I think licks

475
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,320
were following the security every I

476
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,869
the its no

477
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:37,179
and maybe you can see tax was

478
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,369
examples mark force there was one and
finance

479
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:45,239
examples of safety people strike buying
it so

480
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:50,549
to the fish started cash into said like
it

481
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:55,129
his example no government attention but
the market forces changing the agenda

482
00:31:55,129 --> 00:32:00,929
where is accused

483
00:32:00,929 --> 00:32:04,239
example if we all as furs

484
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:07,529
did that we're not official like these

485
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,970
hotels would stop doing it it

486
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,700
just like consumers said your list

487
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,799
here so

488
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,899
workforce technologies has things become
cheaper and works

489
00:32:23,899 --> 00:32:27,539
senses them or less like winter looms

490
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:31,729
came Wireless yes sales increased he was
a

491
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:34,909
much less barrier to entry but alas

492
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:38,139
house trio's a lot less because the
technological

493
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:42,489
its his heels

494
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:45,940
ass as were able to do things

495
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,499
more like wanted %uh last yr

496
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:53,970
less changes social norms this those

497
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,109
for 100 injured here nobody

498
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:02,479
bicycle locks as apparently still
bicycles bicycles

499
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:05,679
or worth the social

500
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,940
or sport yeah

501
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,539
this is so gay and straight Education
here

502
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:18,319
convince people to open stream: its

503
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,479
not click on strange or else that if we
could

504
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:27,999
we can change social norms we can make
yourself more secure

505
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:31,919
you respectively thing else it doesn't
work

506
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,450
it's a good solutions launchers so me

507
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,059
but I think security problems

508
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:46,319
knobs solutions one of my goals

509
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:51,069
technologists to light truth bills

510
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:55,009
so good security utilitarian for you

511
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:58,529
I get the most security overall for
release

512
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:02,190
of all legal players

513
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,309
and was least is to be

514
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:10,859
the person who can best security being
charged security

515
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:14,000
that goal security system is to manage
this

516
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,679
at least and to do that

517
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,329
he said if the Fed Ex Libris and which
will

518
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:24,619
82 to get there

519
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:28,250
here whose in the best she spent

520
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,960
the accountable Fort securities

521
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,418
one is here Wireless are old-line

522
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:39,109
each's players airlines

523
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:42,288
like photo ID required because it
matches

524
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:45,619
there their loss

525
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:50,450
other examples this ATM machines

526
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:54,538
in the US in this year's example it is

527
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:58,710
to invite deals in the US when there was

528
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,299
k-state control that they have

529
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:06,099
the customer guilty for the day 8

530
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:09,559
in the UK was the offices if there was
this is a

531
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:13,609
oil cost who this is with a customer

532
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:17,119
8 which it in the US

533
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,420
ETS security whose well in the hate

534
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,650
because the thanks were the only 30

535
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,690
can't movies insecurity millet said

536
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:33,259
to do so you we're seated US

537
00:35:33,259 --> 00:35:37,430
that's the difference it's at airports

538
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:40,680
Air Force leaders you mean lower

539
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,078
TSA the 12 his people government

540
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,140
please that they will no longer

541
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,308
contractors for the airlines no longer
ship

542
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:53,660
airlines agenda gay quickly smash

543
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,089
government agenda %uh sweet

544
00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,460
problem right you email me at work

545
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,849
that's the basic

546
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:09,000
me another way to see action this is my
favorite ever security

547
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,799
illegal status people see this when you
go into the Sun

548
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,710
stores historical in retail stores
there's a sign in

549
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,989
treasures as your purchase free get a
receipt

550
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:25,890
that is a security countermeasure is a
really insecure

551
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,569
it workdays explain

552
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:33,049
I'll as here the things you were doing

553
00:36:33,049 --> 00:36:36,290
simply and over the years

554
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:41,430
past centuries there the number of
security measures designed to

555
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,940
protecting its employee theft first
floor

556
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,309
was a here register with them

557
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:51,770
deliberate different escorted

558
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,890
thousand acres store owner where he is

559
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,470
open the cash

560
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:01,739
on another on the day she was the rest

561
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,849
wished is what ice

562
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:08,040
and and again the policy like that

563
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,500
and the eighties Force team play true
were all transactions

564
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,049
onerous if University at the end day

565
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:20,680
you look at the total T a little cash

566
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,069
a difference the play yesterday

567
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:27,279
that works lines

568
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:30,720
here's a look tonight he

569
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,830
1

570
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,009
is to get purchases all the rest

571
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,560
you could sell something never really
don't like to register

572
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,710
you can't so now player

573
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,470
wants to ensure cool worse Columbus

574
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:51,150
are too happy to do this kissed and
watch

575
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,800
you did that

576
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,920
play employees just

577
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,640
so hit two is the higher the cost

578
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,859
customers their transaction Spurs agenda
is

579
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,620
here care with

580
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,000
what's desired I

581
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,740

582
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,050

586
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,360
and it does work the suggested

587
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,140
doesn't work because is still in place
after loss away steel

588
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:48,140
against that particular that works with
circular

589
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,830
countermeasure Italy ily attacks today

590
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:58,810
ash the government wanted to make sure

591
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,290
retail stores properly declare

retail stores must recordings of the

594
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:13,130

us both possible

609
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,560
there which make

610

differently your age solid

611
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,540
ever KL versus other this

612
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,300
clearly shot down over Russia the Far
East

613
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,620
with it this straight so yes

614
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:28,350
the general charms sherry night where
the plane shot down because the previous

615

charges jury airplane injured

616
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,650
so airspace was jailed

617
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:41,740
surgical stable his this did

618
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:48,740
nations the world the gym the first

620
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:56,980
that must accept

621
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,690
Chris life itself is Chris email or
security

622
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,370
measures the install we can never really
useless

623
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,670
and leases just

624
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,050
reached want which this'll

625
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,120
level where it makes says trails first

626
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,450
you each much

627
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:23,520
get little it not so

628
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,080
we eat negotiators mitigate the risk

629
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:34,080
this and accept the rest and ask her to
be able i

630
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,790
so the question syquest like their
