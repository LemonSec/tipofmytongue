00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,130
and yeah so they can for

177
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,270
for actually have any workout heart

the

179
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,670
to people who walk past a payphone
one-year that we saw it as I was I was

180
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,230
Alan here RBC yeah early sometimes
directories to do that or something but

181
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,590
anyway

182
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,000
was can I was now mines

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,240
tengo que so we are so there was a tough
thing

184
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,760
now I'm a I don't think they really have
to explain it too much but the

185
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,950
I I can explain that there are many a
comment because a

186
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,030
boxing still works but people keep
saying that

187
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,480
they don't often take the salt intake
phones when reality

188
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,580
that only arm its actual method that a

189
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,740
up red boxing like in the video they
just

190
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,660
the phone now number and red box when we
live doesn't work because

191
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,680
a the hands as needed or just the actual
switches in

192
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,000
recognize the box below and the white
other it like to know more

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,640
ally bad people in security measures but
%uh when the older methods that people

194
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,230
use in

195
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,470
price alerts today as they sell 11

196
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,440
baton was still free and the one ask for

197
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,959
mass renumber like the get the

198
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,580
persons name the event number in the
Cook push 12

199
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,890
to for eleven's gonna them and one

200
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,319
from 11 asks for money and the Redbox

201
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,490
into the handset any custom phone calls
are being made

202
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,480
and after the answer in hanson was a
muted therefore

203
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,720
even run docs and production has become
ease but

204
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,050
not to that glasses to come

205
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,450
%uh one in San easy napping papon's Gaza
Valley some havens now

206
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,360
specifically New Jersey don't need the
handsets

207
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,760
not all that's that's not like a growing
trend or anything well

208
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,540
date what they usually do is a have a
live operator online on it

209
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,080
i mean sometimes it's confusing for
people an army like now these kids

210
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,089
and and sometimes New Jersey Eden just

211
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,700
goes up the phone now number and one box
and that doing anything else

212
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,209
and then no through yet but that's
that's New Jersey

213
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:44,060
yeah I mean necessarily from here to try
air

214
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:51,060
yeah yes we have your suggestion

215
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:07,050
they have to

216
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,909
really into it I know I know the
operator

217
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,929
said she would be at my say that because
I couldn't hear that

218
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:24,260
weaver we've just been told that
operators with the red boxing and that

219
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,220
are not allowed to make the judgment
call and have to let your call go

220
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,630
through

221
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,570
horizon operatives yeah horizon up early
and I quest others

222
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:37,570
the trip

223
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:54,390
the problem

224
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,530
but did you have to report a bit
security so we will not be turned down

225
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,649
we're not be undersold waiting after

226
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,160
the security of the suspected toll fraud
did no I mean

227
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,640
yes

228
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,510
exactly okay so every boxing of course
was a an integral part of the plaz

229
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:36,510
birth

230
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,210

yeah

232
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:54,859
that this seems to be the consensus

233
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:58,769
so I'm moving on the

234
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:02,460
the killer is not always been known for
iPhone related pranks and

235
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,979
stance on things ways that is now is
that genetization but they've also

236
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,659
it was so overcome by well known for
their life frank's one of which were

237
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:10,399
about to see

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,260
a taco bell with the modified the AC ham
radio much like this on freedom downtime

very

307
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,340
technical prank at all so I'm here it
shows like with ingenuity the delay has

308
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,290
at its not just

309
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,159
about phones it's about general comedy
tonya be quite honest

310
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,170
anybody this attacking varies

311
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,080

no console with either has privately
over the course of the con-

314
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,020
month but um that's the reason that

315
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,340
the plae is been such a draw for people
when people just aren't getting into it

316
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,840
its it's kinda like a job to the people

317
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,330
go off from the VLAN they do better
stuff

318
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,760

over IP service

660
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:46,269
