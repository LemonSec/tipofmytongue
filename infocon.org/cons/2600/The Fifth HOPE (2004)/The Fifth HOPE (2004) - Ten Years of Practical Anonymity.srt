go over briefly

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,610
of the history of

20
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,870
anonymous

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,240
services deeply email services on the

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,650
we feel it is to go

26
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,680
the starting point

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,189
edited on internet i'd

28
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:17,400
believe has to be the on dot

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,690
dot if i remember which

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,660
wasn't what we would consider

31
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,130
fully anonymous and isn't the first
mention of

32
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,589
anonymity

33
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,940
in the literature or

34
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,039
in the context of networks

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,730
is the first time that that a wide

36
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,710
internet audience had the opportunity to
experience something uh... remotely

37
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,030
equivalent to anonymous

38
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,330
email services on the net

39
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,500
pennant was

40
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,040
probably

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,240
accurately describe as any

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,370
sign-in server rather than avery mailer

43
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:58,130
users were able to register themselves
with this

44
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,140
mail service ag create an account

45
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,300
that was

46
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,649
something of the

47
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:04,790
equivalent one on one two three apt

48
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,279
anon dot uh... high

49
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:10,609
for the use of

50
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:13,799
the basic tools for step to retrieve
their mail

51
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:17,819
by setting up forty between the uh...
the kind of server and their actual

52
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,409
real address

53
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,759
uh... this

54
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,939
had one major flaw security standpoint
which is you've got to take out a base

55
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,739
of mappings of real addresses too

56
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:29,909
sydney's

57
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,918
on the server at that a base and that's
out

58
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,649
easily attainable through

59
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,859
packing attacks or

60
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:41,819
beaufort was legal attacks

61
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,579
cut subpoena records

62
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,029
that that is if one wants to avoid

63
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:50,179
britain the longest breaking in and
taking them which uh...

64
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,109
i have purple

65
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:54,869
people say that

66
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:57,029
during the time to penetrate

67
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,999
was an operation the early nineties

68
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:05,418
finally checked on it believe it

69
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,329
while parent was

70
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:10,389
gaining in popularity now member at the
time dependent with offer and we didn't

71
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:13,989
have petty things like uh... yahoomail
or hotmail hotmail

72
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,939
what sort of again talking ninety-five
so

73
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,698
uh... the idea of a

74
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,149
an email address that one could attain
that wasn't lead to severe

75
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,169
real name was

76
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:26,819
pretty far in there was

77
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,150
very little of away a free e-mail
services out there you

78
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,339
how do you get the using nice p

79
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:33,059
uh... or

80
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,769
you had to be going to a school where
you had

81
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,379
eagle account and i

82
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,268
internet login

83
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,579
as part of europe

84
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:44,999
that as being a student

85
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,619
the server

86
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:51,329
seventy-fifth is

87
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,389
and anonymous

88
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,989
mail service

89
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,969
only anonymous insofar as

90
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:00,239
your real name is attached to it but
when

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,759
we in the computer security

92
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,569
feel pop

93
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,779
applying something much stronger dot

94
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,269
the talks with vanity

95
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:11,009
is to find as

96
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:13,529
the state of being indistinguishable

97
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:14,289
within a group

98
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:16,999
within a certain set

99
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:20,599
other like individuals

100
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:21,680
if you are to be

101
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,009
truly anonymous

102
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,210
you are in player

103
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,729
in a group of

104
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,889
other actors that are

105
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,289
not significant view hand

106
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,270
vice versa

107
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,919
early

108
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,760
anonymity proposals

109
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,289
well before habit or before any of the
uh...

110
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,808
the real research into

111
00:04:46,809 --> 00:04:48,970
the issues involved in the movie

112
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,090
shortly after

113
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,959
the discovery of publication of

114
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,450
the concept of public key

115
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,960
poverty

116
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,460
excel but i didn't get a chance camel
with

117
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,340
very simple method of

118
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,430
using public kika poverty

119
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,999
created a construct which

120
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,900
allow people to have

121
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,210
truly anonymous

122
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,079
medication

123
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,919
for cultural described in a moment

124
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,370
was a time to be resistance against

125
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,509
more tax than just

126
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:26,900
keeping your name sever from your
postings

127
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,580
having

128
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,919
idea of different threat models

129
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,609
knowing that you have

130
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,390
very threats depending on who you are
who you're hiding

131
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,128
yourself from uh...

132
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,020
leased it understand how

133
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,580
an important distinction here between

134
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,990
using panicked or using a uh... hotmail
throw a cap isn't like your name it

135
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,610
for instance you

136
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,959
have they concerned dept

137
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,210
there are

138
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,520
potential adversaries that are
monitoring

139
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,330
the flotilla list is on the internet

140
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,990
or watching internet traffic

141
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,930
idea that you are hiding your name by
using hotmail or by using

142
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,779
yahoo mail

143
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:13,839
does out the window

144
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,129
you dial account to be linked to you and
you're going to a website

145
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,370
an observer on the network

146
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,749
will be able to

147
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:23,020
determined that

148
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,210
bala hotmail dot com belongs to you live
in the evenings bob

149
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,759
we want to be that

150
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,800
uh... we also

151
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,539
want to avoid

152
00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:38,409
a large creature tax which i'm going to

153
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,930
brush over because

154
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,460
nick map since going be talking in or a
bit more detail

155
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,189
about tax in particular on and the
systems

156
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:50,970
in addition to the the concept of a

157
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,319
global passive

158
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,050
attacker or

159
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,469
omniscient observer

160
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:58,840
just sits a monitors the

161
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,789
looking a traffic or living centers

162
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:04,870
with identities you can do member of
different

163
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,099
more active attacks which

164
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,389
allow you to determine

165
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:15,240
is behaving

166
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,339
similarly twisted name and then

167
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,490
when sent together

168
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,520
again i'm going to

169
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,729
let me put it because of that

170
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,150
the principal concern with

171
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,910
system what pennant

172
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,589
not even the the idea that there would
be

173
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:34,930
an observer

174
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,659
network traffic

175
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:40,529
you have this database uh...

176
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,430
real names

177
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,110
they're really addresses to s

178
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,440
scotus addresses

179
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,120
somebody could post

180
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,340
some controversial material

181
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,659
for the past email

182
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:54,139
around have

183
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,059
years later someone else

184
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,209
attain

185
00:07:57,209 --> 00:07:58,759
the database

186
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,619
and records of

187
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:01,539
once built

188
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:05,159
you know address and correlate that back
to a previously so-called islands

189
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,009
posting

190
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:07,729
and burbulis identity

191
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:09,619
uh... this is a problem

192
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:13,689
this is a problem not only for the users
but also for the operators

193
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:14,870
certainly don't want your

194
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,259
don't be stupid have to give up power

195
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,799
the before

196
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,240
feature provided by the serbs see yet in
the video cell

197
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,610
knowing that this

198
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,759
potential existed

199
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,929
a group of

200
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:31,919
programmers in the the early nineties
artists like punks

201
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,019
started to

202
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,010
look at ways countering this and they
got up

203
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,390
uh... some

204
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,199
david charms works and said hey this
problem bought up before we can

205
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,350
we can do this

206
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,720
and implemented a

207
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,620
proximate renault what tom was going for
with number of

208
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,370
uh... serious shortcomings

209
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,660
refer to as the type one we don't work
for the second for milk

210
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,610
the way this works

211
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,950
interest the concept of change requests

212
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,360
rather that having one rebel which you
had trust i was not a problem with pat

213
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,079
it was

214
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:11,530
not only are you

215
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,420
yourself to the risk the picnic broken
into or

216
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,140
the records subpoenaed but you also
haptic here we trust that the operator

217
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,160
is honest doing sanctity

218
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,900
generally not something that

219
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,519
many people are going to be able to

220
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,980
put into their

221
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,670
so if u

222
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,130
want to avoid having to trust a third
party you can do that

223
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,450
number ways feed

224
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,670
the simplest way is to

225
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,990
assumed that you can trust anyone
third-party

226
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,690
but that you can use multiple third
parties and

227
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,760
make the

228
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,770
the best guess but they're not all going
to offering if they're all

229
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,319
individually untrustworthy

230
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,600
they're not as a group untrustworthy

231
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,990
of more four different retailers

232
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,320
and you've changed your message through

233
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,770
hopeful hops

234
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,780
then you have a iraq insurance that
you're not going to have to

235
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,600
worry about any one of them out at you

236
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,760
the whole of them all getting together
and agreed to break unanimity

237
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,189
now there's again the problem uh...

238
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,960
ball care for forwarding messages
through multiple

239
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,040
what's stopping one

240
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,839
reading the contents up

241
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,990
message and figuring out whose courtroom
where it's going to

242
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,710
that is a problem

243
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,870
due to the

244
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,430
prevalence of

245
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,600
the early introduction out

246
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,460

247
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,420
the internet

248
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,579
in the early nineties pgp

249
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,410
this problem was

250
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,469
roughly salt

251
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,610
that procedures support you take your

stripping off the encryption

simply saying from this on to the second

any question with that

277
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,390
this is the solves the problem of

individual

279
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,160

they can only tell

284
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,299
now the first a look and tell who's
doing sending blast millie tell who's

285
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,090
doing the receiving

286
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,730
and all the imagery retailers can't tell

287
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,230
anything except that there's nothing
with what we know we're going to another

288
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:27,920
and no one party knows both the sender
and the recipient

289
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,319
infrastructure is still in place today

290
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,610
because there's a anymore

291
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,090
addition to this which allows people to

292
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,380
receive messages

293
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,860

actress mapping refer to supply plot

297
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,800
allows you to receive messages acting in
server address which then

298
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,320
forwards to your message

299
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,870
along with

300
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,010
this reply block which is actually a

301
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,360
nest of

302
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,870
instructions to other email alerts on
them

303
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,930
quickly over this

304
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,710
but the

305
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,870
this is important to mention because

306
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,080
uh... it has

307
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,370
one serious problem and it has a

308
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,529
major feature dick

309
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:21,170
people want to be able to receive mail
anonymously and not just send it

310
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,970
reno systems are not really

311
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,180
nearly as useful if you can only send
mail not mislead cannot receive

312
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,460
anonymously that's a major

313
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,520
feature deficit if you just only does
sending

314
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,590
uh... however

315
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,050
the way the type one system

316
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,620
designed

317
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,360
allowance for reply blocks for

318
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,220
return messages through the system

319
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,940
opens up

320
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,410
major security problem

321

index

322
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,380
are receiving messages coming back to
the network

323
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,689
multiple times

324
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,760
each time send it reply back with a
reply block

325
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,300
you are basically

326
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,760
setting yourself up to be

327
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,630
observed as uh...

328
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,880
it's rosa replaced

329
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,970
somebody observing the network ken

330
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,350
witness

331
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,480
replied lost with him or all times and

332
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,080
realize that hey this this message you
always get sent these emails after it

333
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,510
sent through

334
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,050
let's watch this and let's see

335
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,360
is there any pattern to whose receive
email whatever

336
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,980
message i sent the supply block

337
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,460
dispute times and your cable to
determine who's sending

338
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,350
there who's receive masters at a given

339
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,840
nim address

340
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,990
additionally because of the allowance
for this feature

341
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,800
the

342
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,329

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,850
prevention methods

345
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,210
general replace

346
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,260
if you wanted to intercept a message
going through the network

347
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,840
and you have the ability to watch pieces
of the network can determine

348
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,040
that message is going to multiple times
you can then re inject that message

349
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,250
patent

350
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,250
observe it going to rig and i'm not
going to

351
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,970
too much detail here either because had
to leave

352
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,110
nick talk spot concept of replace packs

353
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,920
a major distinction between

354
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,230
the type one system in the

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,200

356
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,720
in a moment

357
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,820
take-two

358
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,280
which is

359
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,100
the network that

360
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,020
a couple free miller suffer packages

361
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,740

362
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,090
and reliable

implement

364
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,700
the typo insistent had no real standard
way of doing

365
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:45,060
uh... message reordering part ways

366
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,430
i'll get the padding in a minute

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,640
with uh...

368
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,670
who are you by the way

369
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,920
people would know about having their her

370
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,740
have to be off there

371
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,539
when you're dealing with the with

372
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:05,689
re mailers you

373
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,720
have the opportunity typically with
layer encryption to uh...

374
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,910
order number of attacks

375
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,829
if u

376
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,720
hotmail coming into remailed

377
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,110
you can we want that mail to go out of
three millimeter order bennett arrived

378
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,070
some whatsoever punks type one
implications do this others don't

379
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,430
there's no real shortens the somebody
watching the reno network and just track

380
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,200
messages going in and coming out in the
order they go through him

381
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,950
annalise

382
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,700
watching it backwash the ball back on
something you know

383
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:43,070
with the center is that the serbians

384
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,390
in the uh... anonymity literature others

385
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:47,279
multiple different approaches to doing

386
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,250
delays

387
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,690
method

388
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,990
that is

389
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,050
in use

390
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,360
most quietly is what's referred to as a
poor max

391
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
where you have that's just come in and
they landed bucket basically you've got

392
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,700
for tax year

393
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,130
messages coming to the network and when
they

394
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,560
you know to debug it fills up until
there is sufficient messages in that

395
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,720
packet that you start sending them out

396
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,920
date gets sent out in random order so

397
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,200
messes coming in are mixed with

398
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,130
autonomous just copy and and

399
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,430
than the ones that have delivered are

400
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,589
consequently leading intelligent working
their rights

401
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,230
happens every node in the network

402
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,870
and you have

403
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,800
good reordering h hop so

404
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,310
adversary that's what's network camps

405
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:45,510
simply cannot trace the uh... the
masters going through

406
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,090
mix master software beheading

407
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,689
a scene way of doing reordering whereas
cyberpunk systems at the records had no

408
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,370
we will bring it all and the

409
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,570
supporting winds

410
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,450
did something less secure

411
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,679
methods of doing reordering

412
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:05,950
petted being generous but

413
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,830
for some adversaries that works
sufficient

414
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,379
aspect is padding

415
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,470
with

416
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,210
pgp

417
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,529
do you have

418
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,900
couple problems

419
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,430
it's generally

420
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,909
can be assumed that as much as travel
for the networks are going to get smog

421
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:28,040
because removing layer concoction

422
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,120
and you have

423
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,440
consequently for removing envelope from
package you've got

424
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,580
smaller package

425
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,120
the way mix master

426
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,299
deals with this every packet it's the
same size

427
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:43,379
messages are

428
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,060
either patent altitude fixed size or
they are split into multiple chunks and

429
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,850
last one if it's not of the

430
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,510
normal sized pat about

431
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,670
you have each message ice excise and

432
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,480
as they travel through the network

433
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,290
padding is added in a way that is that
it's in trouble from the

434
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,590
blah

435
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,668
all packets joint network

436
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:07,710
are identical

437
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,340
they're all carpet garbage and they're
all up the same size

438
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,429
adversary camp watch individual message
and

439
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,950
assume that

440
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,800
dispatches coming in is that it's going
out based on the sides duction or

441
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,080
clever techniques that

442
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,899
politics cust next hour

443
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,289
there's no real way to get this with pgp
which is

444
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,680
white mix master with its own

445
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,880
fiction scheme

446
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,039
uh... there's also the cuts that packing
attacks which allow

447
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,610
an attacker to

448
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,490
manipulated the secretary stand such a
way that the message will still be

449
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,610
old possible

450
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,640
will have some

451
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,810
visible

452
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,540
alteration in the resulting plaintext as
a message travels through system

453
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,620
salvaged

454
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,090
flipping one bit on a uh...

455
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,439
dramatic before enters

456
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,970
i know it will result in you be able to
determine

457
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,860
which message that was as a leaks

458
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,570
that is very easy to do with the pgp

459
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,340
network still possible with an expansion
at work

460
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,408
don't reveal

461
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:18,419
the way peter message format it's
designed of course p_g_ was designed not

462
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,280
as a

463
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,879
a printed for reno networks but as uh...
estrogen

464
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,100
protocols so

465
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,660
these are attacks

466
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,850
against pgp it

467
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,580
for a use that it wasn't like that

468
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,250
it should be

469
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,990
i'm not poking pgp here

470
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,919
but uh... this is

471
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,900
a problem with trying to use

472
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,230
pgp is a general purpose

473
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:47,470
p_g_ which is general purpose a caption
call for a very specific application

474
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,010
there's

475
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,770
one major problem

476
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,440
nexus at work

477
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,280
most read models it is

478
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,980
it is perfectly secure

479
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,280
there are

480
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,090
it's hard to prove its that

481
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,949
are being made on it

482
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,860
biggest failure it's had is that it has
not replace the type one network

483
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,240
there are still plants and still really
felt that was operate the sacrament

484
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,440
network even though it is inherently

485
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,810
very insecure compare to

486
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,360
the effort somebody puts into using it

487
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,290
and that is there's no way to do

488
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,520
return messages next

489
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,470
because mcmaster has

490
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,550
awareness of the replay attacks and has
built in

491
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,770
protection mechanisms against the flat
tax

492
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,080
it has been a method to plot ox

493
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,799
so if you want to be able to use

494
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,870
and in server

495
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,960
based on a plot blocks like and and dot
earliest dot net system

496
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,800
mighty

497
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,390
you are stuck using

498
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,070
type one system

499
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,510
because of that there are still tightly
miller's exactly clients

500
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,580
and this is

501
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,040
overall a bad thing

502
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,408
funk network

503
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,720
was based on software that

504
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,760
a couple of hackers in the bay area for
together in a weekend as occurred

505
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,730
concept

506
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,669
this was back in ninety two

507
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:08,470
patent

508
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,190
it's still being used

509
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:15,830
nextlast has been around since late
ninety four

510
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,780
phased out type one system

511
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,680
because of the

512
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,679
parents asked the apply blocks for the
users

513
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,210
it hasn't

514
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,130
is still usable that what the sent
forward messages

515
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,500
that is a a small minority

516
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,210
compared to people that

517
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,580
use the type one system's reply blocks
and further compared to the people that

518
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,580
use keypad system

519
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,610
because of its ease of use

520
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,770
so

521
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:52,908
the goal in recent years has been to
build a system which is

522
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:54,799
at least a secure or more

523
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,330
that mix master

524
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,649
allows the utility of

525
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,740
return messages in some fashion

526
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:08,740
and achieve the greater ease of use

527
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,740
that's

528
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,330
the question was what's to prevent
encrypting or throw email address in

529
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,049
message to send out through mix master
and then

530
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,279
somebody else manually reply to that
there isn't anything rent that however

531
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,850
it's not all the medical

532
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,330
when a message comes out of the mister
network it comes out as

533
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,870
the i disagree mail are saying do not
reply abt we know that work

534
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,530
so

535
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,620
short you could put in your message hi
this is

536
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,780
deepthroat w_b_ to contact me send me
mail at this address or

537
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,020
i think nick that's used fairly
regularly is uh...

538
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,330
corresponding pgp key which has the
actresses

539
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,199
all autonomous dot messages

540
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,610
where uh...

541
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,669
its use that group and you bc accepted
messages

542
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:07,360
perfectly easement group and

543
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,420
ben canh

544
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,720
obtain email

545
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,120
in a somewhat anonymous fashion

546
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,980
however there's

547
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,950
this problem for the problems with that

548
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,300
that the first problem of just like a
hot no account by receiving mail at

549
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,850
again

550
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,490
you're going there from here

551
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,860
akki address of your

552
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,100
home computer or out the the proxy
server a proper to rip extended you

553
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,330
found or

554
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:34,629
your again not rich in security that you
could she do with the

555
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,210
picture we know

556
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,740
ed and somebody watching the network can
observed

557
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,400
your traffic for

558
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,919
uh... your email traffic

559
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:44,360
and different

560
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,280
simply by replying to the throwing all
address

561
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,860
your uh...

562
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,919
you are the owner of that email address

563
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,130
likewise the argues that solution is not
the greatest either uh...

564
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,240
it's more secure

565
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,050
in order to be truly anonymous you've
got to be hitting like everyone else

566
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:03,870
people that are

567
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,060
accountant it

568
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,769
in order for this to work

569
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:09,870
in a perfect world everyone would
download

570
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,279
the contents of

571
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,220
all thomas passages

572
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,730
everyday at the same time

573
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,530
and

574
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:18,160
they went cherry pick which

575
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,440
which passes they want to be would look
for particular rest easy to certainties

576
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,890
or certain subjects they which is crap
everything

577
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,720
and fold you grab everything

578
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,809
one person when standout as

579
00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:31,270
looking for

580
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,190
they give a message

581
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,280
in actuality the way it's our work is if
you're expecting a message early

582
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,899
check-in

583
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:40,760
hopelessness if you're not expecting a
message

584
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,490
they're not going to check it or you're
going to look at it depicted subject

585
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,570
lines and not ever download anything
less

586
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,860
what you want is there

587
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,360
but you might think you're clever and i
want a whole bunch of other things at

588
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,000
the same time

589
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,790
an attacker who is

590
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,850
watching this behavior can

591
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,000
pretty quickly determine

592
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,700
when you're downloading when you're not
based on

593
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,110
when a certain

594
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,710
he has been positive

595
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,930
you've identified the debbie problem
there outside of not on the ability and

596
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,330
laziness

597
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,230
and

598
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,950
key problems anything that assumes

599
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,790
that the system is only anonymous visa
does the right thing

600
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,200
is broken

601
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,560
since have to behave

602
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,230
properly by default

603
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,350
there needs to be

604
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,679
one standard way of

605
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,330
operation

606
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,310
standard with operation everyone behaves
the same evan does the right thing to do

607
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,918
it a turtle offered to him

608
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,140
incorrectly

609
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,260
type to not having

610
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,010
phased out type one after

611
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,200
nearly a decade now

612
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,410
the problem

613
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,170
has become

614
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,380
blatantly obvious that we need to do
something about

615
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,570
getting rid of this type of type one
network and providing

616
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,070
eminently solutions which addressed

617
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,490
uh... address that the problems that's
type two addresses

618
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,659
preserving a minimum level of
functionality

619
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:17,340
that type one system had preferably
improving upon back

620
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,600
enter the type three network which is

621
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,530
currently one software

622
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,529
program called mcwethy in which is also
written by next

623
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:29,850
implementing a protocol which

624
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,320
i'm not going to go over into too deeply

625
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,649
as well from some pressed for time but

626
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:36,580
it has the

627
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,960
did as cheap scheming

628
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,280
goal which is to

629
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,730
provide a secure method of doing applies

630
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,330
so that there's no

631
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,290
there's no longer any

632
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,220
functionality requirement to keep type

633
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,500
one network alive

634
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,630
however anonymity in addition the
addresses a number of

635
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,990
problems that i can ever that

636
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,180
come into play would be stricken from
model than just somebody watching

637
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,409
messages on the on the network observing
tricking packets and so forth

638
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:10,210
nicholas still

639
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,050
rather important

640
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,620
mix of tax talk will

641
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:22,120
cover those more details please

642
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,260
keeping for mating are

643
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,640
usable clients

644
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,980
type one system has been around for
almost a river over a decade now so

645
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,060
there's

646
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,280
a number of different windows three
applications out there for them

647
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,310
uh... but in order for

648
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,740
picked reidtemple discuss polled room
will need to have

649
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,240
again usable

650
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,820
systems i'd like to see something far
more usable we have for type one

651
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,240
already perfectly

652
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,860
plug-ins for

653
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,220
there is no clients and so forth

654
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,410
that opens up

655
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,929
home of the layer of

656
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,440
adjustable poems

657
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,810
are moving toward

658
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,418
recognizing

659
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,429
in general in the privacy and security
world

660
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:04,440
recognizing that usability

661
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,280
itself is a security issue

662
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,600
users are

663
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,279
eight to daunted by pat

664
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,590
the prospect of using

665
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,250
an additional program to preserve the
privacy

666
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,210
though what not going to use it at that
point the program totally failed in its

667
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,110
mission it does not look once priced all
it's it's

668
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,700
never used

669
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,010
and then the second problem of people
using

670
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:32,890
programs incorrectly due to bad you are
designed

671
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,039
the ability to take shortcuts

672
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:40,129
is an existing problem

673
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,500
i'm going to

674
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,850
briefly cover some other

675
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,210
jump back of a key away from email for a
moment

676
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,510
and discuss

677
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,570
other anonymity systems

678
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,389
many of you are familiar with some of
that amana name some programs and if you

679
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,200
can raise your hand could hurt them

680
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,730
nike of which my with mailto engage one
of the more detail

681
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,139
have you heard a free net

682
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:07,700
you heard of freedom

683
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,960
zero knowledge freedom

684
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,810
yeah i knew about her

685
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,960
pure heads at

686
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,460
what about speed java anonymous proxy

687
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,630
actually numbers jap

688
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,390
felt the same

689
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,890
band

690
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,280
uh... cover

691
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,850
everything that

692
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,840
most of your hands went up for free

693
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,880
pets at since fina makes a lot of claims
either

694
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,890
utterly incorrect

695
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,730
i must get freed up for a moment

696
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:47,539
and move on to

697
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:52,920
zero dollars freedom system which is

698
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,770
wives it's no longer the networks want
an operation help source code is still

699
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,010
available

700
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:04,870
review since they travel soul wants to
start operating one um... once a

701
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,870
network level uh... encryption

702
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,860
and anonymity system which allowed you
to do premise the same sort of

703
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,830
nested encryption and fourteen through
mutual intrested

704
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,780
proxy

705
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,220
scheme as the

706
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,350
reno network only

707
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,650
when you're dealing with

708
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:27,000
network protocols are with us you have a
much

709
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,650
requirement for

710
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,210
low latency than you do with the e-mail

711
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,230
the fact that i knew using

712
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,669
anonymity system

713
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:37,399
right now and that therefore increases p

714
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:39,340
length of time a message

715
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,370
can get delivered via email

716
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,580
a day isn't necessarily a problem

717
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,230
if it takes you know extra half-hour
extra twenty four hours

718
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,820
i really don't care because my it's just
going through and i was cheating and in

719
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,980
the as a trade-off

720
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,180
that performance

721
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,420
albert i don't think any of us here
would be willing to wait

722
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,450
half an hour

723
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,590
or a day for our web pages left

724
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,010
or our pop three login

725
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:14,710
there are a whole new level of
requirements added too

726
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,399
dealing with a in network level

727
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,539
and in the system

728
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,899
based on the need to do it quickly

729
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:22,870
at this

730
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,520
has de facto either drastically
decreasing the amount of enmity that

731
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,370
you're going

732
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,519
to receive

733
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:34,130
vastly increasing the amount of users
you need an orange to achieve equivalent

734
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,880
activity

735
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,810
began in the de sakti is

736
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,580
the number of people

737
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,679
that are behaving

738
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,330
just like you you are

739
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,909
anonymous within that and except

740
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,100
with email it to be

741
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,899
every person who's sending within the
same rough time frame that you sent

742
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,010
a network level

743
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,390
and in the system gets everyone who's
browsing the web at the exact same time

744
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,330
you are

745
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,820
within

746
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,399
more again roughly the same time which
is that it being roughly by a few hours

747
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,830
either direction it's roughly by a few
seconds correction

748
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,320
so you need to have a constant stream of
users on all-time or the ones that are

749
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,250
on win

750
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,750
few others are on

751
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:25,180
have very little and

752
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:30,040
implicit problems with that should be
fairly obvious

753
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,750
this applies to get your router

754
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,850
system as well which

755
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,320
handles the approach to doing this on
apac level slightly differently but in

756
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,350
effect has the same sort of

757
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,139
limitations

758
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:45,260
based on

759
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,160
necessity to do things quickly

760
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,750
and

761
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,730
lack of users

762
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,200
zero three two system by

763
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,670
i've heard a couple numbers as to the
company uses they had the the most

764
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,110
frequently

765
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,269
spoken number is three thousand

766
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:03,380
that's thirty thousand

767
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,770
itself

768
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,970
so you can live let's be dinners and
assume that ten percent of their people

769
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,409
rely any given time

770
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:13,459
and let's assume that there are always
the same ten percent there on any given

771
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,368
time with each other

772
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:23,369
that's three dozen people you're hiding

773
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,099
undoubtedly discuss

774
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,819
in a few minutes out

775
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:30,099
you can google that number down

776
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:32,219
quite quickly by and number of

777
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,509
different methods

778
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:34,708
and

779
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:38,839
the update probably end up

780
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:40,998
about this room

781
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:44,749
now the number of people in this room
that you're having

782
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:50,279
as a very generous up

783
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:55,918
on a really good day

784
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,580
note about city is five hundred

785
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,989
twenty six we have

786
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:02,819
what forty people in here

787
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,288
you'd offer in on the stand

788
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:05,859
tripoli s

789
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:07,169
external

790
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:09,220
factors can be taken into place

791
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,099
suppose you're talking about

792
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:16,659
uh... your experiences with eddie

793
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:20,919
occult that wants to um... make sure you
don't spill their there

794
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:22,759
their secret killing the function uh...

795
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,459
recipes

796
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:26,339
and

797
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:27,379
tax people

798
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:28,839
in this

799
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,930
and amy said trimming the rumor

800
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,009
ab

801
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:35,759
happy practicing catholics

802
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,849
that's an external factor that
eliminates them from everybody sat that

803
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:41,859
the attacker could actually use

804
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:42,730
not based on

805
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,339
technology

806
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:50,139
often people

807
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,049
suggested welll

808
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:55,649
if you have any mails you know what what
i did all this trouble with the

809
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:58,569
you know enemy systems you can just use

810
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:02,159
pop three over

811
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,810
now they're saying pop three over

812
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,429
toward encounter

813
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,609
and send all your mail over these lower
level

814
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,489
minimizing that works and you

815
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:12,359
solve the problem injury to parade d

816
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:14,319
you know activity

817
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:19,169
the problem here is that you don't cheat
the same level anonymity in high latency

818
00:36:19,169 --> 00:36:22,699
or in the low latency in a fast

819
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:25,900
then you can reasonably expect to
achieve they highlight system

820
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,759
which is why we are building these
harleen systems which is what we are

821
00:36:29,759 --> 00:36:31,889
focusing on improving them

822
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:36,379
even though there's something its work
on the floor level

823
00:36:36,379 --> 00:36:37,989
approaches

824
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:40,599
most people

825
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,479
that have a strict threat model

826
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:45,279
uh... too

827
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:47,519
protect their attended when the course
funding

828
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,209
via email

829
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:52,118
are more serious about what they're

830
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:54,949
needs protecting people that

831
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:56,469
are doing

832
00:36:56,469 --> 00:37:00,359
casual web browsing yet don't want

833
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,619
web browsing information the

834
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:06,239
legitimate uses for thieves

835
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,879
one way to systems that don't by b

836
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:11,779
level of

837
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,859
anonymity as as a highly in system

838
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,220
began it all comes back to you

839
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,319
what individual users threat model is

840
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:24,579
who your attackers

841
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:25,900
what motivation they have

842
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,559
why they might be targeting you

843
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,679
who you're out

844
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:33,829
what the capabilities are

845
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:36,589
so if you have

846
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:37,910
if you could surges

847
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,058
simply

848
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:41,019
hiding your

849
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:43,529
present activity

850
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,829
disconnecting your present identity with

851
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:48,279
munications met publicly

852
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:49,239
conversing about

853
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,889
a lot of mailing list or usenet posts
and so forth

854
00:37:53,889 --> 00:37:55,239
tightrope lawyer too

855
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,359
wink you discussion about

856
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,419
legalizing marijuana

857
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:02,939
you might think that using hotmail would
be sufficient anand anyway that could be

858
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:03,928
however

859
00:38:03,929 --> 00:38:06,159
if expressing anything that

860
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,229
is now or potentially could become in
the future

861
00:38:09,229 --> 00:38:12,179
illegal

862
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:14,349
prospect of in trusting your

863
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,169
future

864
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:21,609
safety to be

865
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:24,649
presumably inherent anonymity of hotmail
is dubious

866
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:27,109
there are logs there are

867
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:28,619
i could just correlations

868
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,459
between accounts

869
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:34,149
and uh...

870
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:39,149
your messages could be traced back to
you

871
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:42,449
threat model is only incorporating
future attackers that are looking at the

872
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:43,519
output

873
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,809
of your messages

874
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:46,599
a post to mailing list

875
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,219
and not monitoring the network not
monitoring

876
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:51,399
you actively understanding

877
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:55,989
you have a much less the skit attacker

878
00:38:55,989 --> 00:38:59,449
you otherwise might

879
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:03,299
a system like the type one system

880
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,989
totally sufficient for you

881
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:07,829
there's no tweaking back

882
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:12,159
your real email address to debate not
restricting

883
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,839
as panipat

884
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:16,819
and there's uh...

885
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:18,919
there is future liability

886
00:39:18,919 --> 00:39:20,808
you've sent your mail for that

887
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:22,429
it's been delivered

888
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:25,749
andy norm was looking when this happened
you've got what you want to keep that

889
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:32,749
anonymous posting went back to you

890
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:40,859
after the fact

891
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,839
you're hiding you're you know this is
not being posted

892
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,139
and at the

893
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:47,179
equilibrium message

894
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:50,489
however there are toxic and

895
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:52,759
again prep model if you are

896
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:54,059
potential attacker

897
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,259
your adversary

898
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,899
is someone who is

899
00:39:56,899 --> 00:39:58,979
capable of watching

900
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,160
the network when you send your messages
or is expected to be watching what

901
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,388
you're sending messages

902
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:06,280
then there are toxic come into play

903
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,199
that ten

904
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,929
allow him to determine

905
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:12,259
however if your

906
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:15,489
merely concerned about someone in the
future

907
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:18,259
looking at

908
00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:20,809
mailing list archive and

909
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,309
messages back

910
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:24,099
after the fact

911
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:30,159
type one is really no worse off than
anything else out there

912
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:33,560
does strip layout that you know headers
it does high trivial

913
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,229
email address

914
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:38,529
doesn't give you the same level shirts
that

915
00:40:38,529 --> 00:40:42,229
you might want if your attacker is
someone like

916
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:43,989
like at the outset

917
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:45,949
presumably able to watch

918
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:51,149
blessed trapped in real time and
analyzed

919
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:58,149
getting close to five years thought
south texas questions

920
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:17,509
west actually allow you to remain
anonymous using

921
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:22,609
using the cases it now what do you think
that you are using the question was

922
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:24,529
regarding uh...

923
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:26,680
what happens if you are

924
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,969
cooking this for the state

925
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:30,830
what happens if you're in a scenario
where u

926
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,110
not only have to hide

927
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,819
your identity

928
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:34,739
but need to have the facts to using

929
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,919
and anonymity system as-is referred to
as they come out of him

930
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:42,720
the enemy systems that i've described
that we're talking about here don't

931
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,439
provide this this is a separate

932
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:50,328
security access

933
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:53,449
right now if you're in a situation where

934
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:55,799
even using in any any kind of

935
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:58,329
privacy software is going to get into
trouble

936
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,179
there's really nothing you can do about
it

937
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:04,929
uh... there are number of projects that
attempts to

938
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,990
allow copper kettle creek ation but

939
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,069
nothing is

940
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:10,269
practical at this point

941
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:12,529
the only thing that you can

942
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:15,139
really help for is uh...

943
00:42:15,139 --> 00:42:17,970
again blend in with a large crowd and

944
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,679
only four

945
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,459
chinese dissident using

946
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:24,149
hotmail is

947
00:42:24,149 --> 00:42:28,419
lengthen the can stand out

948
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:31,719
hoosier attacker what is your threat
model

949
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,179
urinated

950
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:37,039
jurisdiction of repressive government
who is

951
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:38,579
comfortable with

952
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:40,899
eight ross

953
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:43,239
conviction that

954
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,229
anonymous poster belongs to this real

955
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:47,579
like identity

956
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:49,949
and doesn't need a hundred percent proof

957
00:42:49,949 --> 00:42:52,579
you're in a lot parcel position then if

958
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:55,149
you are

959
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:56,739
irrefutable proof and the court

960
00:42:56,739 --> 00:43:01,229
for lawsuit

961
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:05,219
they're willing to round up some specs
and put them in jail for unsanitary time

962
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:07,079
because they are

963
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,669
quite likely the person that looking for
but not

964
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:10,828
necessarily

965
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:14,049
and and make them so they're going to do
that

966
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,749
expertly bad idea to make yourself
suspect

967
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:20,709
expedited to use these systems are all

968
00:43:20,709 --> 00:43:24,629
however nevertheless sort because if
people are afraid to use in a distance

969
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,449
and no one will then you have a small
anonymity sat found

970
00:43:28,449 --> 00:43:29,539
you don't

971
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:32,539
blended with anyway if you decide to use
it

972
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:35,470
i've perceived the course in courage
people to use the energy systems that

973
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,869
are out there buch

974
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:41,429
i think we end up

975
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:42,830
talking about the necessity of

976
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,390
armed revolution when where

977
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,529
dealing with garments that are that
oppressive

978
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:51,179
which is entirely separate talked and i
will

979
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:56,839
stop off on it tonight

980
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:00,759
in the uh... you mentioned freenet
system

981
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:04,919
that said

982
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:11,249
uh... and

983
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:12,890
the will

984
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,078
the biggest problem with free at isn't
isn't even

985
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,259
from its apparently architecture but

986
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:22,969
defect at the protocol has changed

987
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:25,569
many times over the past few years

988
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:26,779
date there's

989
00:44:26,779 --> 00:44:28,479
i don't want that this could

990
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:33,190
i could have an entire talk on problems
in free net i don't want that become

991
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,559
what this is

992
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:40,029
my reason for mentioning it was that

993
00:44:40,029 --> 00:44:41,909
the the

994
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:44,060
strong in the system's that are out
there

995
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,229
tend to be very cautious claims

996
00:44:46,229 --> 00:44:49,279
because the more you learn about it and
get the harder you realize it is to

997
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,970
achieve it

998
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,899
more casual

999
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,749
anonymous

1000
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:56,449
vacation systems that

1001
00:44:56,449 --> 00:45:00,629
haven't rigorously evaluate their
anonymity

1002
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:03,139
are more willing to make

1003
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:05,479
ball claims about what their systems can
do

1004
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:07,339
because they haven't realized exactly
what

1005
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:08,919
what the limitations are

1006
00:45:08,919 --> 00:45:10,379
so what i mention

1007
00:45:10,379 --> 00:45:13,779
and to be systems that admission free
not and most of your hands go up

1008
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:17,489
it is just an indication of

1009
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:20,739
marketing the women you know over

1010
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:27,739
practicality

1011
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:33,558
personally successful anonymity proxies

1012
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:39,389
commercially successful in the muddy
proxies

1013
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:43,159
well there are number of

1014
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:45,679
i'm natural successful but number of

1015
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,819
a number of commercial anonymity systems
out there which are all

1016
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:52,859
which all basically with exception of
zero knowledge freedom which is

1017
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:55,589
sadly dead due to

1018
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:57,679
practicality issues

1019
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:00,779
the overhead cost of running a

1020
00:46:00,779 --> 00:46:05,649
mclean c network level system when all
users one it down looking keep pouring

1021
00:46:05,649 --> 00:46:08,328
ault same time becomes astronomical and

1022
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:11,359
if you're charging thirty dollars a year
you can't afford to do it so they shut

1023
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,369
down

1024
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,420
with exception of

1025
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,990
zeke ass all the commercial anonymity
providers out there are trusted single

1026
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,439
hop proxies

1027
00:46:19,439 --> 00:46:21,580
so damn i get back to the problems

1028
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,859
with pat you have

1029
00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:26,799
and you have to trust the provider

1030
00:46:26,799 --> 00:46:30,579
you have to believe that it's not only
are they honest ingane

1031
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,289
that they're going to be hiding your
again before you

1032
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:35,339
but they also have to

1033
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:37,509
not happen or compromise

1034
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:40,459
haven't been broken into and

1035
00:46:40,459 --> 00:46:42,388
had some

1036
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:45,010
had your adversary backdoor their system

1037
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,140
without their knowledge

1038
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:49,790
so you can literally on a single proxy
that's split worthless to you because

1039
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,788
it's been owned by the people you're
trying to hide from

1040
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:55,609
then of course there's legal tax which i

1041
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:58,499
mentioned beginning as well

1042
00:46:58,499 --> 00:46:59,839
which or

1043
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,929
door number of the commercial additive
waters take steps to

1044
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:05,639
be able to avoid

1045
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:07,279
in that day

1046
00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:10,259
orgy walesa subpoenas because they need
to go through

1047
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,179
extra measures to

1048
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:14,849
hide the identity of their users from
themselves

1049
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:18,449
uh... again all the squeezed onto a
matter of trust if

1050
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:25,449
it using your threat model that you can
trust a third party with your identity

1051
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:30,039
you could use them but you're probably
better off using

1052
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:30,930
three systems

1053
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,269
and not paying for them

1054
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:35,869
at this point to do your your

1055
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:37,759
probly better off using tor

1056
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:40,909
denon rubber

1057
00:47:40,909 --> 00:47:47,439
something else on this one from
entrusting this third party

1058
00:47:47,439 --> 00:47:51,719
that that that go where you want to go

1059
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,000
i think you uh... already answers but i
ask you what is your

1060
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,589
prefer system

1061
00:47:56,589 --> 00:47:59,189
if all you're concerned about gays

1062
00:47:59,189 --> 00:48:02,288
i could say my old enemy opera house in
the web here

1063
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:04,669
not worried about anyone significant

1064
00:48:04,669 --> 00:48:06,100
city adversary ted

1065
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,330
we cracked packets but you just don't
want all information before now we don't

1066
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:13,979
want your traffic necessarily vehicles
bc we're gone

1067
00:48:13,979 --> 00:48:17,799
well if if u threat model was greater in
east orange crop web browse the web i'd

1068
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:20,329
say you're out of luck

1069
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,170
it's good that you're only mildly
concerned and you want to

1070
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,239
browse the web

1071
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:28,209
so you can look at

1072
00:48:28,209 --> 00:48:29,929
because it or which

1073
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:33,429
in its current state does not have a
large number of users

1074
00:48:33,429 --> 00:48:36,239
so you to keep in mind that you're in
the senate is extremely small

1075
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,199
particularly given adversary watching
you and realtime rather than somebody

1076
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,519
who is

1077
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:45,559
simply watching on the ends if or you're
really worried about is hiding

1078
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:48,799
your identity from the websites you're
going to

1079
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:50,319
you get away with a lot more

1080
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,339
then if you are

1081
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:54,810
or not hiding yourself from you know i
espy or from

1082
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,788
your

1083
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:59,479
employer or from the government

1084
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:02,239
your your committee proaches are to use

1085
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,059
denny rudder system

1086
00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:07,319
or to use a commercial anonymity
provider

1087
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,788
have any of you heard of any commercial
and flutters answer

1088
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:15,199
one hand

1089
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:16,469
prox if i

1090
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:18,539
i've not even heard of proxy fight

1091
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,879
do they make money

1092
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:23,379
graduations of them

1093
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:26,578
no one else has heard of any commercial
interests

1094
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:30,019
that's a surprising

1095
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:32,189
other questions

1096
00:49:32,189 --> 00:49:33,379
uh... have you heard about

1097
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:38,959
proxy changed and what do you think
about

1098
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:43,679
what's it changes the um... way of doing
inline

1099
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,359
you open up one open proxy connected at
the proxy

1100
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:49,170
changed maybe

1101
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,269
for five proxies

1102
00:49:51,269 --> 00:49:52,839
you kicked back to

1103
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:54,219
decide

1104
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:57,069
okay unchanged source port

1105
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:59,379
again this is uh...

1106
00:49:59,379 --> 00:50:01,308
depending on his threat

1107
00:50:01,309 --> 00:50:03,949
what the fellow it's either

1108
00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:05,839
p cheap way of hiding here

1109
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,049
happy from a website you're going to are
completely useless

1110
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,479
because

1111
00:50:10,479 --> 00:50:12,589
if there's no way of encryption no

1112
00:50:12,589 --> 00:50:14,310
remix ingo users

1113
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,589
somebody washing their purchased

1114
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:20,089
sees we are going to doesn't matter
which one to five hops

1115
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:21,379
under their hand if

1116
00:50:21,379 --> 00:50:24,999
you are trying to hide yourself from

1117
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:26,169
from a uh...

1118
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:27,888
uh... website

1119
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:30,719
sure you do that but i'm not certain
what you'd want to do it through five

1120
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,909
different dropped in just one because
any one of those five ten

1121
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,669
see where you're going to and who you
are and

1122
00:50:36,669 --> 00:50:37,919
reveal your identity

1123
00:50:37,919 --> 00:50:39,620
uh... in fact it would be better gifts

1124
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,609
pick one that you trust rather than five
but you all have to trust

1125
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:45,969
and a chain system with no encryption

1126
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:47,399
it's not

1127
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:51,009
you're not making the bet that

1128
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:52,200
at least one of the

1129
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,590
ones you picked will high trade and that
you make of that all of them will

1130
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,879
hydrate entity

1131
00:50:56,879 --> 00:50:58,400
this turns out

1132
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,439
somewhat counter-intuitive to realize
that using more is worse in that case

1133
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:02,379
but

1134
00:51:02,379 --> 00:51:04,549
turns out that if you're using

1135
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:05,669
fiber that you have

1136
00:51:05,669 --> 00:51:08,049
five times jets that one of them will

1137
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:15,049
reveal your identity

1138
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:28,058
they didn't the problems any one of
these parties could look at the met

1139
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:31,619
trafficker passing through and

1140
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:34,039
figure out what your final destination
is

1141
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:35,569
whereas within the

1142
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:39,058
with all the other systems you have
player decryption

1143
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:42,139
while one proxy might be bad

1144
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,769
and i can look at uh... the

1145
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:46,509
you know if it's the first topic and see
who is sending

1146
00:51:46,509 --> 00:51:49,689
or its last topic and see where those
bitches are going to do

1147
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,379
it doesn't see both at once it sees

1148
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:53,700
who is sending and

1149
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,279
disinfected blob

1150
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:57,480
that he knows to pass on to this next
top

1151
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,829
it doesn't see

1152
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:04,439
what the compact law barred which
include the final message amt

1153
00:52:04,439 --> 00:52:07,719
material that uh... writing material in
there that determines where it's going

1154
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:12,559
to be peter neil addresses an email
message or a final website request

1155
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,769
commute home

1156
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:15,639
when the status of expanding

1157
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,109
mister

1158
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:18,229
the old man

1159
00:52:18,229 --> 00:52:23,589
uh... idly bike and and you can drop in
creek pieces because the developer

1160
00:52:23,589 --> 00:52:26,119
next alien is

1161
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:27,219
in

1162
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:28,529
deployed data right now

1163
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:33,609
crack or

1164
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:34,509
it's easy

1165
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:37,640
it's nato trust this pretty thing really
serious at this point because we're

1166
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,219
still testing it and the protocol is not

1167
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:42,699
one hundred-percent solid yet

1168
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:48,639
but everyone should download and play
with report bugs stage

1169
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:50,989
um...

1170
00:52:50,989 --> 00:52:57,989
uh...

1171
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:02,949
uh... p_p_i_ is likely to change

1172
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:06,459
under their hemdie command-line
interface is pretty solid

1173
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:10,689
although we'd need for the a_p_ i to get
stable would be for

1174
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:13,348
someone should come up with nice clean
interface

1175
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:17,150
israel in python right now so if you
need it

1176
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,349
be written in c then

1177
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:20,339
um...

1178
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:21,549
you need to do your own

1179
00:53:21,549 --> 00:53:24,559
intimidation there's a four x see that
you could look out

1180
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,269
monarchy dirt is a speck on an artsy
level of detail

1181
00:53:28,269 --> 00:53:30,889
that you could you look at sdi
compatible implications

1182
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:35,059
one of the mix master developers tried
over the course of a couple weeks jude

1183
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:39,879
you a compatible java library and he got
to send messages so it's not hard for

1184
00:53:39,879 --> 00:53:41,509
the call to clone

1185
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,660
notes right now

1186
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,038
and speaking of cloning we're problem

1187
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:50,299
we also that mix master four point oh is
slated to speak type three particle

1188
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:52,909
so it will operate with next again

1189
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:56,129
the uh... the idea is to have

1190
00:53:56,129 --> 00:54:00,109
seem like a religion external cell which
can then be used

1191
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:02,189
in other programs ads

1192
00:54:02,189 --> 00:54:06,819
ailing coble library on cross-platform
basis so that

1193
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:10,379
hopefully people could be encouraged to
write like it's fort mill clients and so

1194
00:54:10,379 --> 00:54:11,269
forth

1195
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:13,969
that would speak type three

1196
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:19,519
how many elf beta notes do you have
right now

1197
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:25,219
affirmatively aftermath of the word
health data

1198
00:54:25,219 --> 00:54:29,579
for the currently active reno network
cartoon network a mix master network

1199
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:33,439
there's uh... felt fifty active notes

1200
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:37,879
and health forty of those at any given
time our

1201
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:44,879
functioning properly

1202
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:55,259
all typed on exp

1203
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:58,149
did rectitude

1204
00:54:58,149 --> 00:55:03,919
or at the

1205
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:10,919
edge

1206
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:16,439
what let's put it

1207
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:18,618
okay so that was a day for a week

1208
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,329
high-level brief

1209
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:22,419
intro to the the

1210
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:25,569
past ten years of history of

1211
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:28,849
low in cedar eileen c_n_n_ recessed in
the email

1212
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:33,589
and then we touched briefly on the the
lower latency

1213
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:36,679
less secure

1214
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:39,059
more usable for

1215
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:42,669
general purpose applications like web
browsing and in the systems

1216
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:44,459
and

1217
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:46,509
i guess i would reduce

1218
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,559
pick matheson here who is

1219
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,159
going to be talking about attacks on

1220
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:54,249
the various additives

1221
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:57,799
yeah might help yes your questions
thirty nine

1222
00:55:57,799 --> 00:55:58,419
and
