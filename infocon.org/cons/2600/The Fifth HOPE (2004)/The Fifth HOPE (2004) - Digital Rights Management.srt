1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,170
and this is not a technical talk

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,700
there's nothing here that should
frighten even the most technical big

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,220
people

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,580
rather intend to present an overview of
the number

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,790
trends which are coming together mostly
out of the public eye

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,340
to change how you use your computer to
change how you can use your computer

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,750
one definition of digital rights
management

8
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,699
goes like this: digital rights
management is a systematic approach to

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:29,740
copyright protection for digital media

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,380
I disagree with that definition dear am
in fact has little to do with copyright

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,040
protection

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,760
copyright protections under the laws in
the United States and have any other

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,320
country

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
are inherently limited copyright last
for a limited period of time

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,219
the copyright holder's ability to
prevent people from using his work is

16
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,180
strongly limited in the number of
different ways such as the fair use

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,809
doctrine

18
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,870
here's a section straight out of title
17 in the US Code

19
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,320
notwithstanding the provisions of
Sections 106 and 106 a

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,860
the fair use of a copyrighted work
including such use by reproduction

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,049
in copies or phone or records or by any
other means specified by that section

22
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:12,899
for purposes such as criticism comment
news reporting teaching including

23
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,209
multiple copies for classroom use

24
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:20,950
scholarship or research is not an
infringement of copyright what the law

25
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,560
says in black and white is that you can
make copies of copyrighted works without

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,849
the copyright holder's

27
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:29,219
permission under wide variety of
circumstances

28
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:32,770
criticism comment news reporting
teaching scholarship

29
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,130
research making copies for any of these
reasons is not an infringement of

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,779
copyright

31
00:01:36,779 --> 00:01:40,908
admittedly a gray areas but in the broad
strokes

32
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,429
copyright laws intended to prohibit only
bowl for-profit

33
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:49,919
copying and this is why I take issue
with the term rights in the phrase DRM

34
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:52,939
in with the definition ovett as a
systematic approach to copyright

35
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,739
protection for digital media

36
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,969
the Rams not intend to stop people from
doing things prohibited by the copyright

37
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:00,770
laws

38
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,369
is intended to stop people from doing
things that are allowed by the copyright

39
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:04,889
laws

40
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:08,258
for instance on Amazon dot com right now

41
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,469
you can buy yourself a copy of the
United States Constitution

42
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:15,689
for only two dollars and ninety nine
cents it's an electronic copy

43
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:20,049
ebook for your PDA and it comes in two
different flavors have DRM

44
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:24,670
you can choose between Microsoft DRM
which doesn't allow you to print it or

45
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,829
copy it at all

46
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,810
or you can choose Adobe's DRM which
doesn't allow you to copy it

47
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,569
but it does allow you to print it and I
quote up to 24 copies per year

48
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,469
24 copies per year you can print the
Constitution Bill of Rights

49
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:44,579
everything what mean if a sense the US
Constitution as you might expect

50
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,959
is not a work protected by copyright US
government works are not protected by

51
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,250
copyright. at all

52
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,989
US laws are not protected by copyright
it even if the document were protected

53
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,249
by copyright it would have expired
almost 200 years ago

54
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:02,030
we don't have we don't have to look at
all the exceptions carved out of

55
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,230
copyright law by the fair use doctrine
because there isn't even the slightest

56
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,858
question whether this document has any
copyright protection at all

57
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,219
it doesn't but the DRM is a different
matter

58
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:15,659
the DRM on this version that the
constitution will prevent you from

59
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,140
making copies or printing it except for
your 24 copies per year

60
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,519
even though you have the absolute right
to do so it is enforcing a right

61
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,590
which the publishers do not actually
have and taking away our right that you

62
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,349
do have

63
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,349
the choice the publisher this DRM
document made

64
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:36,129
to allow you to print to four copies per
year could have been a different one

65
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,569
the choice could have been to let you
print it a hundred times or none

66
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,799
it is not a choice based in copyright
law a choice the publisher

67
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,340
good exercise due to the power granted
by the DRM system

68
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,689
and for no other reason when copyright
laws made in theory at least

69
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:56,060
there's a balancing conducted by our
elected representatives

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,340
where they determine what is the best
setup laws for the country

71
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,239
when these restrictions were placed by
the publisher this Dr and file

72
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,159
there was no balancing act the publisher
chose the ability to print to

73
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,749
four copies per year because they
believe that that will allow them to

74
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:12,950
sell more copies

75
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,410
than letting buyers print one copy per
year or letting them print three copies

76
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,789
per year

77
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,930
the publisher was the sole determiner
what you can do with the file

78
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,130
after you have allegedly purchased it

79
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,380
the ideas behind dr. Amer simple
economics supply-and-demand

80
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,360
when the supplier anything goes down
while demand stays the same

81
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,830
the price must go up when you're dealing
with the real world with physical items

82
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,609
supply-and-demand works reasonably in
the electronic world were

83
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,620
infinite copies can be made at any
property

84
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,940
supply and demand doesn't work well
there's an infinite supply have anything

85
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,830
you might want

86
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,740
DRM is intended to reduce the supply of
work so that publishers can demand

87
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,229
higher prices for them

88
00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:00,030
and make more money it's hard to reduce
the supply a copy that the Constitution

89
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,460
the text to that document is available
on any number web sites

90
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,849
putting one's run run by the US
government so even though this is a

91
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:10,740
lengthy document a love interest in
clauses that is used in thousands of

92
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,460
ways every single day

93
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,359
and ought to be read by every single US
citizen the publisher can only demand

94
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,259
two dollars nine

95
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,060
incense for it it's just too much
competition out there

96
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,270
they're similar problems when selling
any copyrighted work

97
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,870
many people don't buy books because they
can borrow them at no charge from their

98
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,479
local library

99
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,389
nowadays libraries are getting into the
music and video business too

100
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,770
would you believe that videos are
actually more popular than books in most

101
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,878
libraries today

102
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,150
the RAM eliminates libraries eliminates
the very idea lending and borrowing

103
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,310
many people don't buy new books they buy
used ones from a used bookstore

104
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,509
the RAM eliminates used bookstores
eliminates the very idea every sale

105
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:56,940
so all the people who use libraries

106
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,979
is there a better word Pirates

107
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,430
a and all the people who buy books from
used bookstores

108
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,949
we can't call them pirates 2 they're all
out of luck in a DRM world

109
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,919
that means that everyone has to pay for
retail price if they want access to a

110
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,060
particular

111
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,099
copyrighted work and publishers love
that

112
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:21,250
you may have heard about a speech given
recently by Cory Doctorow I'll

113
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,690
if you haven't gonna give you a pointer
to it in the new modern fashion

114
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,150
not a Uniform Resource Locator but
something easier

115
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,870
Google for doctor oh dear am quick I
feel lucky

116
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,419
doctor spoke to a group at Microsoft
developers and get a number of good

117
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,719
points to make

118
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,110
the first he made was that DRM doesn't
work in fact that dr. I'm can't work

119
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,639
doctor is a bright guy but he's wrong
DRM

120
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,379
can work let me step back a second

121
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:54,120
those view live in New York City maybe
vaguely aware of a long-standing debate

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,580
about

123
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,419
firefighters New York City's been around
for a long time and for most of that

124
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,870
time it was something of a death trap

125
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,659
bucket brigades horse-drawn pump wagons
and now the modern in professional New

126
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,169
York Fire Department

127
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,270
the history of New York's back history a
battle against fire

128
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,659
today however the battle has been won
building codes require fire resistant

129
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:15,530
materials

130
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,490
they require sprinklers and today there
are far far fewer fires in New York City

131
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,780
in there once were

132
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,449
and those fires are much easier to put
out probably have the firefighters

133
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,069
working in New York City today

134
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,879
are unneeded their unneeded because the
infrastructure

135
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:36,069
the city has changed the city is changed
from a fire promoting

136
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:40,970
to a fire inhibiting environment and
this is a tremendous change

137
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,800
this doesn't mean there are no fires but
the systemic risk from

138
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,960
fire is much much lower than it once was

139
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,569
there's no such thing anymore as a giant
fire that consumes half the city

140
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,599
it took many years because there just
isn't that much turnover in buildings

141
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,360
the change still is incomplete of course
and won't be for many years

142
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,319
but the tide has turned it's all
downhill from here

143
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,909
doctor a statement that the year and
doesn't work is true

144
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:11,840
but only in the current computing
environment if the infrastructure

145
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,280
changed from a DRM

146
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,349
unfriendly to a DRM friendly environment

147
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:19,938
doctor a statement would change from
being true two untrue

148
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:23,860
in the infrastructure can change and it
can change in the same way and for the

149
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,659
same reasons that new york city changed

150
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,740
regulations can change the way that new
buildings or new hardware

151
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,780
enters the system this laptop's

152
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,860
construction was affected by literally
thousands have different rules and

153
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,120
regulations

154
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,360
it has seals from CE the FCC

155
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,610
underwriters laboratory CI BBC I

156
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,520
their couple I don't even recognize on
the bottom in this machine

157
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,100
if any one of those rule sets had
included dr. am

158
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,560
this laptop would include DRM as well

159
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,920
how old are your computers at home one
year to

160
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,689
3 probably not more than 45 after five
years

161
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,740
PC searched be pretty dated the
computing world this one on which

162
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,560
almost every piece of software almost
every piece of hardware

163
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,130
is less than five years old is a nearly
complete turnover in five years

164
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,470
every five years if underwriters
laboratory as a requirement that all

165
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,820
personal computers have to be Bondi blue
in color

166
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,910
within five years almost every PC in use

167
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,360
will be Bondi blue it took new york city
many decades to change for a fire

168
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,840
promoting city to a fire inhibiting 1

169
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,330
but it changed if the laws change
regarding trm

170
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,590
it will be only a few years before the
whole infrastructure the Internet

171
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,210
changes along with those laws

172
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,710
how hard do you think it'll be to get a
law passed mandating trm in your

173
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,410
hardware

174
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,760
if you've seen Michael Moore's new movie
you see a representative conyers say

175
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,260
sit down my son we don't read most to
the bills that we vote on

176
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,830
there have been laws proposed as early
as 2001

177
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,790
2001 that would make DRM mandatory in
all computer systems in the United

178
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,300
States

179
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,300
senator hatch has a bill before congress
right now that would effectively mandate

180
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,720
DRM in every single device you can buy

181
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,820
because it would make hardware companies
liable for any copyright infringement

182
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,620
that occurs with the devices they
manufacture

183
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,430
so far those laws have been fought and
haven't pass congress

184
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,820
it's very doubtful that that will
continue to be true

185
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,950
and when not if DRM is mandated

186
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,550
you be only a few years before it is
spread throughout the entire computing

187
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,640
environment

188
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,210
resolve your hardware and software gets
replaced in a few years

189
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,220
and then doctor a statement that DRM
can't work

190
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,950
becomes untrue the current DRM systems
are mostly based in software running on

191
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,450
general-purpose computing systems

192
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,690
as it turns out when you expose a DRM
and software to the entire world

193
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,000
somewhere there'll be someone bright
enough to deconstruct your soft drink

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,650
wrack your system

195
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:04,209
once it's cracked the writer their own
softer impaled on a Web site

196
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:08,320
that doesn't mean your DRM system is
worthless however

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,340
how many be on a DVD player

198
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,020
on how many have you have used John
Johansson's code

199
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,100
play a DVD on Linux or to copy a DVD

200
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,640
that's maybe the I don't know twenty
percent

201
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,680
I am so about 20 percent have you have
made you so that

202
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,280
DRM hack the restive you have been bound
by the same

203
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,560
DVD restrictions as the rest of us even
though the hack exists

204
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,720
you've been content to just go with the
flow and accept the restrictions imposed

205
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,860
by the people who created the DVD in
crypts in Scheme

206
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,340
because it's extra work tour to route
around it

207
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,890
you have to find some extra code on the
internet somewhere download it make it

208
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,110
work on your system

209
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,190
it's easier to go with the flow if at
all possible

210
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,170
so the existence of a hack makes the DVD
DRM system weaker

211
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,560
but it doesn't make it entirely useless
I absolutely guarantee that the DVD RAM

212
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,490
system

213
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,740
has been substantially successful from
the point of view of the movie industry

214
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,340
most people cannot just pop a DVD into
their computer and burn a copy of it

215
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,250
and us most people do indeed by a second
copy of the DVD if they need to

216
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,060
even if they need the second copy for
purposes such as criticism comment news

217
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,160
reporting teaching scholarship or
research

218
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,219
most people can even get a screen
capture video segment from a DVD

219
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,040
they can't even use one single picture
from that disc

220
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,579
the digital rights management system in
DVD's has been mostly

221
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,670
almost entirely successful in reducing
the supply the copyrighted works

222
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,709
covered by despite the existence of a
hack

223
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,640
for that system this the DRM system that
was weak

224
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,150
because it was implemented in software
and it wasn't backed by specialized

225
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,280
hardware

226
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,839
harbors vastly harder to hack and
softwares

227
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,330
if you watch the previous presentation
you saw him he saw some other

228
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,640
specialized equipment

229
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,800
infrared analyses and so on its

230
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,380
it's not at all impossible this crowd is
aware of all sorts of fancy schmancy

231
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,720
techniques to figure out what's going on
inside a tiny computer chip

232
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,370
no harder is completely hack proof for
at least no computer consumer hardware

233
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,470
is

234
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,770
there's a cost problem you see I can
cost too much to the relief crazy

235
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,990
hardware anti hacking techniques can't
be used

236
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,220
that even the weakest systems
implemented in hardware 10 or a hundred

237
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,600
times harder to crack down systems
implemented only in software

238
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,250
the number of people able to attack
hardware systems is much much fewer than

239
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,690
the number able to attack software

240
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,020
and best of all you can make hardware
system so that a hacker one of them

241
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,930
doesn't spread

242
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:51,410
others so that there is no one setup
code on the internet to download to fix

243
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,740
your DRM system so that it stops
interfering with you

244
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,890
and you have to be skilled with a
soldering iron not a keyboard

245
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,500
once DRM is rooted in hardware it has a
real chance at working quite well

246
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,010
so let's talk about DRM coming to
hardware near you

247
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,970
microsoft has been a major driver behind
this there are many other companies

248
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,140
on board as well so please don't think
it's only Microsoft

249
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,420
what Microsoft and others are working on
is called by them

250
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,690
trustee trusted computing does not sound
all warm and fuzzy

251
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,510
who wouldn't wanna trusted computer
trust the computer the computer is your

252
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,800
friend

253
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,330
the warm and fuzzy name trusted
computing is actually a deep peace

254
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,640
misdirection trust in the sense they're
using it

255
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,880
means that remote corporations get to
trust your computer to do something

256
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,980
or not to do something it means that
when their desires about doing something

257
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,400
or not doing something conflict with the
desires

258
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,320
you the owner the computer their desires
win

259
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,510
that's trust in the sense they're using
the word it's the exact opposite in the

260
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,860
sense that you are I would use the word

261
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,210
a trusted computer is literally and
exactly one that you the owner cannot

262
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,350
trust

263
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,210
the kind of desires that they would want
to override at least at first

264
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:15,560
would be things like copy this mp3 file
download a copy of Star Wars Episode six

265
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,040
in a very real sense there's absolutely
no difference between a computer that

266
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,640
has been hacked into

267
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,090
and a trusted computer both computers
will probably do what you want

268
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,420
most at the time but both computers have
a third party somewhere out there

269
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,700
who can override your desires and take
control of your PC for their purposes

270
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,660
when it suits them Microsoft is called
their trusted computing plans by the

271
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,699
code name of palladium

272
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,090
when clearly in got a lot of bad press
they changed the name to next

273
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,070
generations ago

274
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,230
secure computing base it doesn't matter
what the name is

275
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,730
microsoft plans to include it in their
next operating system release

276
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,780
into retrofitted to some extent to
current Windows XP systems

277
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,490
so if you use Windows you'll be using
palladium pretty soon

278
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:04,130
that takes care one level up trusted
computing

279
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,250
the trusted computing is an
all-encompassing plan

280
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,390
I'm gonna briefly cover some parts of
your computer that have trusted

281
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,270
computing coming to them in the near
future

282
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,829
step one is the BIOS basic input/output
system is the harder the computer a

283
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,040
small bit of softer that effectively
bootstraps the computer from

284
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,430
inner chunk of hardware into a living
breathing machine

285
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,630
the major manufactures a biosensor
Phoenix and Amii

286
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,410
most PC computers PC compatible
computers have a bias from one of these

287
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,800
two companies

288
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,640
both companies have already developed
biases with digital rights management

289
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,140
built-in

290
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,850
those biases are available for
commercial sale so the next computer you

291
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,330
buy

292
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,380
will probably have one step two is the
CPU

293
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,420
both AMD and Intel are working on DRM
built in your computer's CPU

294
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,390
both of them have been criticized for it
and that is sort of slow the roll out of

295
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,270
it

296
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,520
but please rest assured that they're
basically waiting for Microsoft's next

297
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,110
operating system to come out in a few
years

298
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,309
as soon as Microsoft is selling
operating systems that fully support

299
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:07,209
palladium

300
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:12,589
AMD and Intel will both be selling CPU's
that supported as well

301
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,559
step three is the hard drive all the
data stored on your computer is stored

302
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,668
on the hard drive so that's a natural
chokepoint

303
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,079
there is a fairly substantial fight a
few years ago about this particular

304
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,759
aspect

305
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:28,169
trusted computing and the standards
committee working on it rejected a

306
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:30,320
standard that was proposed

307
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,259
this slows down but does not at all stop
this area development

308
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:38,309
what it appears is that the drive
manufacturers are building in the

309
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:41,330
capability secretly instead of in the
semi-public

310
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,049
standards process lesson they learned
from the previous outcry

311
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:51,570
was not don't do this but instead don't
let people know that we're doing this

312
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,559
several hard drives are being marketed
right now the RAM built-in

313
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,889
these are mostly small portable drives
intended for mp3 players and the like

314
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:03,870
there's no reason that that the same DRM
abilities couldn't be included in hard

315
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,720
drives intended for desktop computers
and notebooks

316
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,899
step four is all the other devices that
interact with the computer

317
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:14,230
particularly ones that allow large
amounts of data to enter exit the

318
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,470
machine

319
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,379
your monitor displays in it images thats
data exiting the computer

320
00:18:19,379 --> 00:18:23,320
your sound card please sounds that stat
exiting the computer

321
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,879
your sound card health record sounds
that's data entry

322
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:30,679
and of course all the little USB and
FireWire and similar ports

323
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,269
are designed to move large amounts of
data in a row to the computer

324
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:38,049
each of these is covered by some sort of
DRM plan

325
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:41,799
monitors are covered in the near future
you can expect it

326
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:45,320
when your monitor receives an image to
display it will check and make sure you

327
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,509
have permission actually

328
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:50,809
you that image before it shows it to you
this sounds a little crazy

329
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,149
I'm completely serious Google for DVI
DRM

330
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:59,250
and you'll see that the next generation
digital Mon monitors will all have DRM

331
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,379
built-in

332
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:04,340
in a few years you won't be able to buy
a monitor without it

333
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,470
sound cards are covered in a few years
your sound card will recognize

334
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,990
watermarks embedded in music files that
you're trying to play are trying to

335
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,820
record

336
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,870
and they refused to do so yard
authorized

337
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,600
watermarks are extra inaudible sounds
embedded in the music file

338
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,919
just like paper watermarked that are
only visible in the papers held up to

339
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,110
the light

340
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,539
so if you're trying to record the latest
Madonna song of the radio

341
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,820
you will have these inaudible water
marks in it when you try to plug the

342
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,928
radio and your computer and record

343
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:39,399
your sound card won't let USB Firewire
it said our most definitely covered

344
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:42,610
there's a current specification called
USB Mass Storage

345
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,919
digital cameras flash drives and so on
are typically USB mass storage devices

346
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,710
this is going to be replaced with the
media Transfer Protocol

347
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,870
which is as you might expect if you've
been following this talk

348
00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:00,620
fully DRM enabled each time you transfer
files onto our of a pure digital camera

349
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,870
USB port you plug it into will be
checking to make sure you are

350
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,830
transferring trm restricted

351
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,720
files I don't want to cover each and
every item specifically

352
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,330
a the Trusted Computing people have a
DRM specification for

353
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,820
each and every possible way to move data
onto our of a computer

354
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,860
each and every way will check and make
sure you're allowed to move the

355
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,499
particular data in question before
permits you to do so

356
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:30,070
a lot of thought a lot of man-hours have
gone into this

357
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,059
do not underestimated

358
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:37,559
every other computing related devices
also covered

359
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,570
the creators at this trusted computing
architecture realize the

360
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,320
the computers and many other gadgets
around your home or going to interact

361
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,279
now in the or in the near future and
they have planned for that

362
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,320
there's a specification for trusted
network connections

363
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,418
or computers are only permitted to
connect to a network

364
00:20:55,419 --> 00:20:59,039
if they are trusted in if they prove
that fact

365
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,450
think about the possibilities are that
per minute that network could be a

366
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,509
corporate network

367
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:08,019
rate could be your high-speed internet
access providers network

368
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:11,210
digital television all have DRM built-in

369
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:16,080
so you probably already have digital
high-definition televisions

370
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,299
those televisions and the next
generation digital video recorders like

371
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:20,090
TiVo

372
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,529
or respect that the RM codes that will
be sent with digital television

373
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:24,769
programming

374
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:28,639
when NBC doesn't want you to be able to
record the Sunday night movie

375
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:33,470
those a set a flag in their broadcast
studio and your television and your TiVo

376
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,529
will refuse to record it refuse

377
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,990
even though you told the TiVo to record
it even though it's completely legal for

378
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,590
you to record it according to the
Supreme Court

379
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,230
your TiVo that you own will refuse to
obey your desires

380
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,159
that TiVo will be a system that is
trusted in the perverse sense that we've

381
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:52,679
been talking about

382
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,549
by the television and cable networks
since they trusted

383
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,929
you cannot let me wrap up

384
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:05,230
within a few years certainly immediately
after the release of Microsoft's next

385
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,629
operating system

386
00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:11,059
the RAM is going to be everywhere
although I have considerable respect for

387
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:12,178
the hacking abilities

388
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,899
the global Internet community harder is
much harder to hack

389
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:19,149
and the hacks that are discovered
probably won't be easy for everyone to

390
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:20,419
use

391
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,220
even or hacks are available most people
almost everyone

392
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,230
far more than ninety-nine point nine
percent won't use them

393
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,269
because they're hard going with the DRM
low is relatively easy

394
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,429
what this inexorably leads to is a world
where companies like Microsoft and AOL

395
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:38,740
Time Warner

396
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,159
have a considerable degree of control
over everyone's computers

397
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,090
and how those computers are used
effectively the company's pulling the

398
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,360
DRM strings

399
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,070
will have route on everyone and there is

400
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,240
frankly very little you can do about it

401
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,659
you can build hardware that doesn't have
DRM but you may not be able to

402
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:59,350
communicate with anyone else

403
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,600
and you probably won't be able to sell
that hardware in the United States

404
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,149
legally

405
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:08,259
maybe we'll get some help from China and
Taiwan you may find it economically

406
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,190
profitable

407
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,919
to continue to produce ninety RAM
complaint hardware

408
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,460
but that harbor can be stopped at the
borders by US Customs

409
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,600
you can try to fight against in congress
Hollywood has a lot more money than you

410
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,889
do

411
00:23:22,889 --> 00:23:27,249
I wish I could end on a happier note but
I don't think that I can

412
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:31,700
the best I can suggest is is that you
dust off your hardware hacking skills

413
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,429
those have you figured out how to mod an
x-box the ticket booth clinics

414
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:39,399
we need more you your efforts won't
really make what much difference in what

415
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,289
happens to most in the world

416
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:44,450
your efforts will generally be illegal
under laws such as the Digital

417
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,139
Millennium Copyright Act

418
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:49,889
but the ability to rebel even if it's
not mainstream

419
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:54,669
is an important ability to retain you'll
be the ones with the changing computers

420
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:59,350
and Aug files without DRM and hopefully
you'll be able to keep the vision

421
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,240
unfettered computing alive long enough
for this DRM

422
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,159
bad to pass long enough for the general
public to return to this golden age

423
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
unrestricted Turing machines owned by
everyone

424
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,320
thank you

425
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,170
J

426
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:32,500
workers for fair use

427
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,500
and let me say that with regard to how
bad the situation is

428
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,960
michael has stated it if anything is
understated

429
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,420
it is that bad absurd though it seems
disney's building

430
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,440
big brothers infrastructure okay now we
say how strongly I disagree

431
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,410
with the last few lines let me ask the
following question:

432
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,550
how many have you spoken to your
congressperson

433
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,720
your senator and I want an honest answer
I mean spoken to them

434
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,690
how many okay yes about this of course

435
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,190
how many to them to their office

436
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm any written letters how many letters
how many have gone down ok how many

437
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,050
exerc

438
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,340
okay this is ridiculous this is the
elite where the ultimate fibers

439
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,770
upon us the future the world depends
let's go to Washington

440
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,950
within the next month every single
person in this room we've already got

441
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,540
appointments with several people

442
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,860
several senators several congress folk

443
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,980
let's call for trying to hearings
several committees New Yorkers for fair

444
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,400
use will shortly announce this

445
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,740
but new yorkers for fair use is a tiny
organization what we need is

446
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,740
everybody if you can't spend the time
you're agreeing

447
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,780
to give up your computer's I'm sorry
could go on for a long time

448
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,340
New Yorkers for fair use .org what is it
for gotten NY fair use

449
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,110
in life where you start work okay but
but the answer is

450
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,820
if you're not gonna week everywhere here
wasting our time today

451
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,090
everybody you okay

452
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:12,120
good

453
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,110
days absolutely right arm I mean he's
more optimistic than I am in our ability

454
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,190
to affect the

455
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,590
that the views have congress I mean
congress does understand

456
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,570
somethings okay I mean this is not don't
think that congress

457
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:32,540
is is purely venal I they do understand
some things I mean

458
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,590
for example new cars

459
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,610
okay new cars are computers nowadays

460
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:44,910
I mean I I have a a Toyota Prius out
back in Brooklyn that has something like

461
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,960
seventy three

462
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,990
microprocessors in it I

463
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,110
I mean it's more computers than
everything else in my house

464
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,260
put together I and the the auto
manufacturers

465
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,900
looks for a little while as if they were
going to make car repair

466
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,430
a proprietary thing that they're going
to completely eliminate the idea the

467
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,760
independent car repair shop by simply
not providing

468
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,900
the to the general public you know for
any to anyone except

469
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,750
Toyota dealers the ability to read the
codes from the car's computer and find

470
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,620
out what was wrong with that in repair
it

471
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,160
I congress understands the idea of
getting doused on car repairs

472
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:28,480
by the dealer and so congress' in the
process of passing laws to make that

473
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,490
sorta gala Jing

474
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,920
and not that night gouging in general
the legal but

475
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,940
the just withholding the codes it
illegal so independent car repair shops

476
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,110
will continue to exist because congress
is able to relate that to a very simple

477
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,820
idea that they already understand which
is

478
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,030
the dealer charges more than the guy on
the corner

479
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:54,280
you know the dealer is gouging you I I
am not aware of a similar

480
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,910
simple idea that we could use to

481
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:02,640
relay you know ideas about dr. am in
computers to congress

482
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,520
if they're is something simple like that
that we could beat them over the head

483
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,470
with that even

484
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,500
like seventy-year-old congressman who
only use typewriters

485
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,980
you know in dictate to their secretaries
when they need to send email

486
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,300
I if there is some simple mean that we
can use

487
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,690
to to relay the problems then maybe
there's some hope for getting them to

488
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,870
understand

489
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:32,040
yes okay I've had the following
experienced in times

490
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,620
speaking to a congressman or senator or
staffer

491
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,600
remember of the staff love a committee

492
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,940
and I have several other people at the
end of it what they do is they look at

493
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,060
us and say you know we'd wondered

494
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,080
what the issue was because you couldn't
see the issue

495
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,419
because all the years from the other
side and there's no issue nobody is for

496
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,140
massive

497
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,210
copyright infringement except for a few
visionaries

498
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,570
on nobody a.m. nobody is for depriving

499
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,800
artists up their bread and butter and
starving their children

500
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,800
to the could understand even why they
were being lobbied by the MPAA in the

501
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,460
area

502
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,790
okay we spoke to them of times a
response was

503
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,240
thank you and we got a few converts let
me tell you

504
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,830
the USA would probably already have
enacted by

505
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,080
arm regulatory she acted things much
worse than what they've already done

506
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,070
if they hadn't been arm actual meetings
which are not publicized

507
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,810
bring some of us and the Department of
Commerce ok actually went on too long

508
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,560
but

509
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,860
don't be defeatist they do listen

510
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,070
you know when you talk to one he doesn't
listen that's interesting report it

511
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,389
because they always listen they may not
vote the way you want but

512
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,940
their show ignorant but they're
intelligent

513
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,540
and they're educated most at the merch
that doing the right thing that's of

514
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,850
wells just if you you know if you wanna
speak you could come up here and grab

515
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,780
the microphone

516
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,270
hi um I wanna to know I I definitely
believe that lobbying government is

517
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,230
important in this issue but

518
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,440
another avenue a possible solution is
could it possibly be making

519
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,350
alliances within the computer industry
finding computer companies

520
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,040
who are going to take a stand against
the RM within the united states like

521
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,230
II came in a little later not to mention
apple computer but

522
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,030
do you know what their stance on DRM is

523
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,629
Apple sorta straddling the fence at the
moment

524
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:35,070
they're they're both I mean iTunes for
example is a is a DRM restricted

525
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:39,139
music service they were probably

526
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,700
the Apple probably wouldn't have been
able to make the deals that they did

527
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,060
with the music industry if they hadn't

528
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,110
restricted the music with the RM so

529
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,660
innocence they wanted to have this music
service they agreed

530
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,130
and that sort of the position that a lot
of the the computer companies

531
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:59,210
are put in i think i mean it sort of

532
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,560
from their point of view if they're

533
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,010
it doesn't matter if if they're you know
if if they even if they know

534
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,030
that putting out a DRM restricted
product

535
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,030
is you know a worse product for that

536
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,629
for the customer than a non dear I'm
restricted product

537
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,630
you know what happens is that these
these companies they're trying to sell

538
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,230
the RM that the

539
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:26,470
hollywood and and so on come to them and
they say we're going to get everybody on

540
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,550
board so nobody else will be making a
product that's better than yours you

541
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,510
know there won't be any

542
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:36,400
feature differentiation I you know and
iTunes does well

543
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,490
because it's sort of one of the least
restrictive DRM things right i mean it

544
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,350
doesn't but they're not

545
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,880
they don't have to compete if the at I
don't know if you

546
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,370
if I'm making my point here but it's the
hardware companies

547
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,350
are worth you know they do business with
these other companies the other

548
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,080
companies are urging them

549
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,870
put in DRM tear stuff you know and the
general

550
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,050
public doesn't know or care so it's
sorta

551
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,530
it's a hidden thing and you can buy
products today

552
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,600
music CDs they come loaded up with DRM

553
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,510
and they have you know markings me it's
not like it has a big label on it that

554
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,030
says

555
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,290
warning this CD is much less useful to
you

556
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,080
then this CD over here so you don't know

557
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,480
you know and they're both the same price
in there sitting side by side in the

558
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,310
in the display case I'm so there's no
way for people to sort of put their

559
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,980
purchasing power

560
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,510
into into making that differentiation
you know people buy products that are

561
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,090
organics there prominently

562
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,970
label great but DRM things are not
prominently label

563
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:45,170
so you even if you wanna spend your
dollar on on something that

564
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,810
isn't in a supporting this this trm a
fad

565
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,780
it's very it's hard to do so you have to
do a lot of research

566
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,210
there

567
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,570
are couple oral quickies are

568
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,100
if you're wanna take something that they
don't want you to tape

569
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,330
assume you'll be able to get analog out
and you could tape it on your PC

570
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,050
current PCR you what else can disturb

571
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,680
Duke for instance can to keep you for
reading The Guardian

572
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,420
things what else is in there that they
haven't do you have a managed to find

573
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,570
out what rumors

574
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:24,659
do you hear and for what his son doing
as well as Apple's Sun

575
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:30,080
I well Park in all their the analog hole
so to speak is sorta

576
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,160
is rather well-known and so

577
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,660
for things I like digital television for
example where you might

578
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,410
you know you might receive digital TV
from your cable provider and then your

579
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,900
television has several different outputs
for example on the back

580
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,100
they're not going to let you send that
out in analog

581
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,920
I mean that the best you might be able
to do is sorta record it with a

582
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,750
camcorder something like that

583
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,700
I what his son doing I don't know I
think sons kinda irrelevant

584
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,130
failing company at this moment I would
look more at Apple

585
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:06,180
Apple you know you might be able to to
get people

586
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,700
you know like steve wozniak who serve
understand

587
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,300
but there you know Apple's a business
like anyone else and if the dollars are

588
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,140
to be made in building DRM stuff that
Apple will build

589
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,350
CRM stuff

590
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,110
yet you'd mention one site in your

591
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,830
one thing to go on the TV I

592
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,719
is there website anywhere has anyone
built like a database where people can

593
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,540
record list what products are currently
using DRM

594
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,570
what processors in the future that are
being developed are using the RM

595
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,470
things like that so that we can be more
aware what products like he said

596
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,770
if things are being done secretly being
done under the table

597
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,949
people who first could probably find out
about them the people in this world so

598
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:58,790
it would be nice for us to have like a
central place week but the information

599
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,570
I don't know if there's a central
database i mean because they're just

600
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,770
I mean there basically infinite number
of different

601
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,800
hardware devices and computing gadgets
that are produced every day

602
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,460
so I don't think there's any central
database that anybody has constructed

603
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,710
mean you know you could be the one

604
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,390
I there you know there's 1i want
something choc sur something that was

605
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:25,690
sad shocks fat chuck's has a

606
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,840
has a database ove CDs that have DRM on
them

607
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,250
your CDs from the major RIAA

608
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,330
members that are coming out with DRM on
the CDs and so they keep a database that

609
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,720
these corrupt CDs but the you know
that's just one part of the

610
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,720
overall

611
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,300
you mentioned for example Intel

612
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,420
name people processors sure with the RM
in the I mean if you remember a few

613
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,230
years back

614
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,070
there was a big up or because the penny
3i think it was

615
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,400
had a serial number that was being
embedded in the processor

616
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,650
hit that was like version 2.01 the right
coming DRM

617
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,370
and people yet no but my point is that
people raise such rockets about it that

618
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,460
they had to make it be able to be
disabled in the BIOS we find out that of

619
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,340
course it could be

620
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,970
still read even soft the the point is
that

621
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:27,260
I mean is is like what

622
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,400
I guess that is what versions of these
things are what you're right I mean it

623
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,350
will be it will be useful to know

624
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,529
you know especially when you're trying
to make a difference by buying

625
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,740
ninety arms stop I don't know any

626
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,760
have any database thats you're talking
about a lot of information a lot of

627
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,690
effort to collect

628
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,940
I don't have the time for example I
don't know who would

629
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,690
but hopefully someone will yeah are just
a curiosity

630
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,910
is this in any way going to slow down or
entirely stopped the

631
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,520
really big commercial arm piracy

632
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,640
by you know by Russians and the Chinese
and and others

633
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,940
I i don't see it that they are being
affected mostly

634
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:14,740
mostly no see because that the you know
what that they use commercial

635
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,300
DVD or CD stamping machines that just
makes a bit for bit copy of what the

636
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,000
you buy one in Los Angeles you put it on
FedEx

637
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,580
out to Russia the FedEx guy you take it
on

638
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,950
FedEx guy hands it to on the open it up
they put it in the machine makes bit for

639
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,260
bit

640
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,050
exact duplicates I sweat like any if
they if they put out a commercial disc

641
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,290
that runs on your machine

642
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,520
the pirated disc will be exactly
identical I feel like working

643
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,600
penalized because Microsoft software

644
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,190
and and are the music industry is being
wholesale pirated by

645
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,910
by these you know mobs in these
countries I don't I don't see why we

646
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,740
should have to be persecuted for

647
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,840
because the man who wears piracy in this
country

648
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,310
is substantially arm in a smaller than
in these other countries

649
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,960
well I mean a you're right it

650
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,210
it really has nothing to do with
commercial piracy although

651
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,580
that is you know one of the
justifications that they will trot out

652
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,330
but it really has nothing to do with it

653
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,520
commercial piracy is basically a totally
different

654
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,340
entity that DRM is not intended to cure
and

655
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,910
in the wall anyway

656
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,399
or somebody as the first date

657
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,060
the DirecTV has a deer and down resin
cause

658
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,450
if you're not using DVI in an HDCP
configuration

659
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,710
they can damage the broadcast it is in
the crisis

660
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,000
second large say that DVI and its
current implementation has been cracked

661
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,080
by third parties

662
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,610
but could at least ourselves by
predicting the algorithm

663
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,040
is doing is the deer are cities that are
out there to you with the other

664
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,779
should force the RAM on the machines as
for newer cities

665
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,710
cactus made for is that in our rights to
sue for

666
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,930
software is it

667
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,649
let's have a little busier than our
rights to to sue yeah because if you

668
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,720
want if you drop some of the newer CDs
in your machine in a Windows environment

669
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,750
it silently and salsa cactus me Bertucci
Randy

670
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,820
I asked copper and thats I would think
that you have a medical

671
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,300
claim for you know for something like
that nobody has brought that lawsuit yet

672
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,570
but somebody may I mean that I know that
the

673
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,710
that has been looking at this the

674
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,140
she wore a CD is today implementation at
Cactus members

675
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,609
i won this

676
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:45,140
archer yeah I I don't know if you

677
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,140
owner maybe I have a fax ours straight
away if or if you straight away from it

678
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,410
or something but doesn't the

679
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,759
actress computing platform addition to
being a brainchild over

680
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,370
microsoft and intel on what I also have

681
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,920
legacy is there a like Department
justice

682
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,510
interest in that as well not so far as I
know

683
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:08,840
that trusted computing group

684
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,990
is just an assortment of hardware

685
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,350
manufactures for the most part that have

686
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,509
you know gathered together to build some

687
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:22,170
some hardware to cut to a common set of
specifications it's not really driven by

688
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,120
the justice department

689
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,330
although you could say that it's that it
you know that there's clearly I can

690
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,480
environment where they sort of sense
that DRM is coming in so they want to

691
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,430
build some kind of common standards at
all there things will interoperate

692
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:41,379
you know in that sense they're their
sort of feel it coming in that

693
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,050
the decision to even participate in a
group might be driven by the

694
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,100
you know the political scheme in
washington but

695
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,650
it's mostly a hardware companies doing
it ourselves

696
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,150
not they could in they could stand up in
refuse

697
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,320
I mean if nobody if all of the the
hardware companies who build

698
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,210
DVD players had stood up to hollywood
and said we're not going to build DVD

699
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,020
players that you're reading cryptid
DVD's we demand

700
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,340
that you only produce DVD's that have
awning cryptid movies on them

701
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,190
and we're only going to make DVD players
that will play those kinda fun in

702
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,800
cryptic movies

703
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,370
we would have a very different you know

704
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:27,000
laserdisc system currently you know we
would we wouldn't have these problems at

705
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,070
all but

706
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,470
they didn't comments 0 we have a very
different

707
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:37,230
you know we have been gripped the DVD's

708
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,640
there

709
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,629
in reference to the last question wall

710
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,939
her Department of Justice doesn't have a
specific

711
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:51,839
you know stated stake in their

712
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,849
most to the large companies there are

713
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:00,359
published things about you know if there
was legislation

714
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:05,279
mandating DRM that you know the company
stating that of course

715
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:08,499
since the government was so nice to
mandated that it

716
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:11,739
all that information would be available

717
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:15,729
to you now FBI the Doga acceptor

718
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:20,429
yeah I I didn't really cover touch on
the privacy aspect but

719
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:24,039
you know one other those again I was
trying to make this non-technical and

720
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:24,839
not terribly

721
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:28,299
confusing accessible I the

722
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:32,079
there's a there is a substantial privacy
problem

723
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,390
which may or may not turn out to be
really severe

724
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,749
because you know that idea that the RAM
system is that you have to limit your

725
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:44,219
copy or electronic worked only be usable
by you

726
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:47,649
and so that implies some sort of
identity where they can check

727
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:52,689
verified that its you that's using it
and if the DRM systems are

728
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:56,989
created such that you know a lot of your
personal information and

729
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:01,039
being held by other companies there's a
real privacy

730
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,309
the bahcall in the works I think that

731
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:08,279
think that there's enough political
pressure that it's not going to go that

732
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:08,679
way

733
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:13,529
company sort of sense that people will
have a

734
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:18,429
visceral objection follow their personal
information is being stored by

735
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:24,549
you know lol time-warner so I think that
it's not really gonna go that way in

736
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:25,538
that little sorta

737
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:28,799
be just generic universal id:

738
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:31,889
numbers right just a long serial number
will be you

739
00:43:31,889 --> 00:43:36,339
wall necessarily linked with you know
the fact that you're John Brown in that

740
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:37,029
you live on

741
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:43,729
123 Main Street I don't think that DRM
is really going to be a major privacy

742
00:43:43,729 --> 00:43:48,289
hazard but the reason that it's not is
because there has been a lot of this

743
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:51,219
political pressure applied to congress
and a

744
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:54,880
they have got some sense that that's
something that people to object

745
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,399
and

746
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:01,859
I'm one other thing that was actually my
original

747
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:05,949
thing is actually not sure your comment
on this

748
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:09,169
is but I see as you know one of the
greatest

749
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:14,239
hopes against this is that want it
becomes mandated

750
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,849
then the cartel mentality all

751
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:21,859
take all the bitten full effect and in
the same way that

752
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:25,019
you know in this country you now

753
00:44:25,019 --> 00:44:28,479
certain say certain firearms in

754
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:32,299
you know certain chemical substances

755
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:36,589
are you now various shades ok highly
illegal

756
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:41,419
yet are you know pretty commonly
available to anybody with their

757
00:44:41,419 --> 00:44:44,908
you know want or need to find them

758
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:49,029
that you know at the point that this
becomes

759
00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:53,549
Dr and becomes mandated there will be a

760
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:57,559
large monetary interest in you know

761
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,130
selling conveniently you now

762
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:04,539
non-compliant computers

763
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:08,449
well yeah that that may be but I don't
want to be

764
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:12,869
you are risking arrest for buying and
nine a ninety RAM computer

765
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:16,249
maybe that's just me but I don't you
know I don't wanna

766
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:20,189
worry that the guy I am buying it from
as an undercover at Coppin

767
00:45:20,189 --> 00:45:23,288
in you know

768
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:27,319
in the park over here something baby
when are these people

769
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:34,319
came down there like in the middle right
there

770
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,510
just let you know the 5c is the county
protection for AV

771
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:54,470
it's over firewire NDVI is being
pressured a proprietary interface

772
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:59,320
it's five corporations I believe Sony
Panasonic message to and Mitsubishi

773
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,600
are the fact that are leading the
standard and some the products have

774
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,140
already

775
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,279
such as the axing 9000 yes to be a 9000
yes

776
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,300
SEC D over 1394 he's

777
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,860
is talking about go ahead and give it
give the mic back

778
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,270
he said is admin at the bald guy

779
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:23,000
their number number 0 a razor cut their

780
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,410
I he is talking about at the standards
for

781
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:29,569
DRM in consumer electronics which

782
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:33,200
have all the major consumer electronics
manufacturers on board

783
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,860
that's outgrowth what's happening with
kam

784
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,060
with the computers I don't consider it
as important as what's happening with

785
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,460
personal computers because

786
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,460
personal computers you know our that's
the the Alpha and the Omega

787
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,490
you know I'd to some extent I don't care
whether you can copy your DVD's

788
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:55,180
from a DVD player or something but I do
care whether you can use your personal

789
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:55,859
computer

790
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,150
for anything you wanted to use anything
you wanna do or whether that

791
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:04,040
has Dr applied so arm

792
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,070
I think you made an excellent point when

793
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,080
during your speech you brought up

794
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,799
I how the US Constitution has been
protected by your

795
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,280
obviously buy on Amazon right now $2.99

796
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,910
great deal a a wonderful

797
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,990
wonderful bill arm and and obviously the
I'm sure there's a lot of other things

798
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,740
out there

799
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,110
in the public domain that that may fall
under

800
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:33,430
the same DRM stuff and that's and that's
one

801
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:38,430
one point a bit and and something that
could be affected by legislation however

802
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,549
I am current copyright works

803
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:45,160
things are coming out now I how much of
that

804
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,250
can actually be affected by legislation
I mean isn't that I mean

805
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,600
I read Slashdot so I am NOT a lawyer

806
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,840
and I don't know if there is any here
yeah I

807
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,310
but I'm maybe there's one in the room
but but how much

808
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,840
love the new things are coming up when
they be more functional up a contract

809
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,510
law

810
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:08,750
that you know I you're a buyer your
seller

811
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,770
and a if you want to buy this thing for
me this is how you buy it

812
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:17,430
and that's how I'm releasing and thats
you know I'll choose not to buy it

813
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,960
but you know that that that's a question
in my mind

814
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,950
yet that's how it that's how it has been
perceived

815
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,240
certainly today as as a contract issue
you know

816
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,780
you you signed the contract to give me
your first born child

817
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:35,910
you know you signed it right i mean it's
your your your fall if he didn't want to

818
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,970
make that deal you shouldn't have signed
in blood on the dotted line

819
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:43,080
a thats congress does have

820
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,069
the idea you know that the laws are
supposed to be made with the public

821
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,180
interest in mind

822
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:53,149
so congress could for example pass a law
saying that anything that is protected

823
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,210
by DRM

824
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,610
isn't is no longer protected by
copyright

825
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:00,750
you know that so then they would have a
choice

826
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,310
choosing between the protections a
traditional copyright law

827
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:08,930
or between whatever electronic
protections they thought they could get

828
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,500
from DRM systems

829
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,480
you know congress could could make that
choice and that would sort of

830
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,520
make explicit the idea that there are

831
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,750
trade-offs in this system and that
congress wouldn't be then supporting

832
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,010
you know the DRM doesn't expire it won't
expire

833
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:29,450
ever you know you want it you know me I
think that legislation so on

834
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,940
it maybe they could in fact legislate
something to say that okay

835
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:38,130
fourteen years or whatever you know
however old mickey mouse is whatever it

836
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:39,010
is that the current

837
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,070
a job for how are copyright last

838
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:45,690
arm maybe they could legislate something
to say

839
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,240
okay trm you can't have it go but this
far

840
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,970
but but to that point it within the 14
years or whatever

841
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,180
you really can do you can sell

842
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,440
you know your CD for ten thousand
dollars you can sell it

843
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,370
you know just on a track or whatever it
you know it's up to you

844
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,130
as as the composer the work and that's
why I'm saying I don't know how much

845
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,530
legislation

846
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:12,220
can affect a lot of a lot of the things
that that you're speaking out

847
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:16,180
you can't but you can your your
statement is correct as a statement of

848
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:16,980
current

849
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,340
law but you don't have to be

850
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,860
just as a for example I mean it was
common at one point in time to make

851
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,530
so-called

852
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:29,120
restrictive covenant covenants on the
seal land

853
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,109
and the idea was that you would have a
bunch of white people in a community and

854
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:37,280
they would put restrictive covenants on
their lands that even if they sold it

855
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,930
that person who bought it could not then
resell it

856
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,720
to a black person the restrictive
covenants were mostly about race

857
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,460
and so the in this way the land would
acquire sort of permanent

858
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,160
lock present prevented it from ever
being sold to a black person

859
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,710
the courts have ruled that those are
unenforceable

860
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,320
so this this contract provisions even if
it's written in your contract is

861
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,680
completely unenforceable

862
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,350
New York City tenant laws rent
regulations have tons

863
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,410
things that have been found to be
unenforceable are you can't set

864
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:16,149
restrict certain restrictions on how you
know what the conditions that tenants

865
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,790
rent an apartment under

866
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,040
because the courts have found that is in
the public interest not to allow some

867
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,690
contract provisions to be enforced

868
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,140
up so that could happen with the rm2 you
know it doesn't have to be the way that

869
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:32,259
you're saying where the copyright holder
gets a a permanent lock on things and

870
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,330
the courts could hold differently or
congress could set things up differently

871
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,799
already thank you all for coming here
tonight
