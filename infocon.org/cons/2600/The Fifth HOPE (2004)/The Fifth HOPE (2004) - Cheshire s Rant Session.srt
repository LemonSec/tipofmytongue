by the media

90
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,550
if you look at that URL you'll see that

special day

106
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,629
as you can see this is a bit of a social
experiment

107
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:18,330
personally I am afraid of what could
happen here

108

where the people listening can go back
to their bosses find it on the website

114
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,539

115
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,229
and they get it fixed you won't get

00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,810
arm for those who say that Bill Gates
has no conscience

156
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,990
well I say that's right he had to marry
one

157
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,480
user okay this is but spam

158
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,390
I think the credit card companies can
actually have the power to

159
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,660
I get rid of spammers they don't comply
with laws that we need to be some new

160
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,860
legislation

161
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,640
but the basically using a credit card
number that was not

162
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,959
real in not active you would basically
going try and purchase something

163
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,740
from a spammer a basically and then when
they just went to go and get the

164
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,910
authorization

165
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,010
that would be logged and you could
basically track down the spammers to the

166
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,990
money trail

167
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,089
a document the span that they were
sending

168
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,220
and when you're paying boy and and track
it down

169
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,820
but of course we need lots to do this
for stopping the credit card companies

170
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,200
can take care of it thank you very good

171
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,920
I do have video URL's is to where they
can get more information

172
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,920
okay thank you moment minor

173
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,709
about this because I forgot to started
when he started

174
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:26,779
but up but as you can see you don't need
to take the four forty-five seconds if

175
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:27,449
you don't want to

176
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:31,430
and that's appreciated are the

177
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,639
their headline figures answer are not
particularly general general thoughts

178
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,329
about the internet and look

179
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,930
security in that type of thing or work I
think

180
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,029
original a lotta what's going on

181
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:48,370
weekend and it's important to understand
that the Internet is a toy can be taken

182
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,569
away in a time

183
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:53,699
are contrary to what minions will tell
you it certainly can be

184
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,009
are it is critical I don't know any good
patriotic organization that has not

185
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:01,029
I made mandatory high-priority

186
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:06,930
that a backup usually do communications
equipment is EMP Pru

187
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,310
are be placed in pack up

188
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,850
art is certainly easy for any government
to any NGO

189
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,680
basically two using MP weapons as

190
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,170
your danger you know although the latter
dial in kodak's

191

205
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:24,370
this is an idea that is approved in the
community

206
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:30,589
okay as anyone else who needs microphone

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,920
they take the committee the ticket name

298
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,680
it's got to be the it's got to be the
best operating system out there

299
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,720
i mean there are so many opportunities
to get free access to a system

300
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,270
its I in every time they patch if
there's another three that are open

301
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,030
I ellen is the URL think rootkit dot com

302
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:08,030
is a wonderful starting point I was
gonna put up

303
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,590
routed to come to break into but no to
access

304
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,689
up

305
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,450
nomenclature is all okay

306
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:28,100
anymore instead I see I have a rant

aged

377
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:04,510
are my only addition to that

378
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,450
is that bankamerica all seems use SSN
and a four character pit

379
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,559
a Wachovia as well any others with this
problem

380
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,000
is it possible that there is a vendor
that is selling software

381
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,360
with this particular problem and perhaps
it's

382
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,370
it's that vendor that should be hearing
this and so maybe the guys at Wachovia

383
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:30,720
and Bank of America and Commerzbank will
now get in touch with this Vendor

384
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,559
wouldn't that be a nice pics HSBC does
not do that from what we see

385
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:42,120
very good back and chase does not do
that

386
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,740
good they should these other back that
you find their software vendor

387
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:49,440
cool yet although the

388
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,830
the default for most to the system seems
to be to use the last four digits of

389
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,399
your SSN as the PM

390
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:58,059

you logged in thank you okay

440
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,350
minds about open instant messaging
protocols I know a lot of people use the

441
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,570
old instant messenger

442
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,389
and none of them like AOL and so I tell
them you know you could be using Jaber

443
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:43,559
its Jaber .org and you could be having
secure communications based on a server

444
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:48,928
that is not run by time warner or AOL
and they always defended by saying

445
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:52,840
dead their their entire body was is made
for people who wouldn't get

446
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,440
and wouldn't switch over so I tell them
how easy it would be just personal a

447
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,029
message

448
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:01,000
that says you move the Jabber post a
link to its a get it and then

449
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,509
everyone could switch in use there seems
screen NC wooden actually end up losing

450
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,499
any of your friends

451
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:09,259
by none of them seem to go with this

452
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:13,619
and just ignored it and I hope maybe
that could change here to get back

453
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,289
hi

00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:45,009
that's kinda fun the kind of stupid but
the moment you post this to the Internet

461
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:49,409
in the trees people to actually use it
and decide you the next dog who's going

462
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:50,629
to save the world

463
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:53,769
with this thing you invented yourself
and suddenly you smarter than people

464
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:58,070
who've been analyzing these things for
your whole life

465
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,320
II chant finish that sentence and I
shouldn't have to finish that sentence

466
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,889
ok

467
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:12,049
okay he will switch to read today

468
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,759
this is our little social experiment

469
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,259
be work I know the URL on

470
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:24,460
my problem is poorly managed call
centers for technical support

471
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,529
and the line due to unusually high

472
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:31,320
calling volume which is such a load of
crap

473
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,340
because it's all trend based its easy to
staff a call center it's not rocket

474
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
science

475
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,139
no 25 people call between noon in one
last Monday staff enough people the

476
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,950
sport 25 calls between noon and one it's
not rocket science

477
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,500
you can do it

478
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,659
I'll tell you that the problem is the
three calls a gap between a1 in 3 p.m.

479
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:58,039
and then having overstep urge at

480
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:03,200
they'd tell you that any other ads today

481
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,639
okay well arm met with his call for
break

482
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:10,700
and BRRip time for coffee grown
accessions

483
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:15,200
wanna thank you and for those ugly
pardon

484
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,730
are no not always do the government are

485
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,549
for those who want to stay after in here
rebels

486
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,918
taken so long will allow that after we
break it up

487
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,220
I just wanna mention again what the
session was about

488
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,609
this is a social experiment in seeing if
we can

489
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:35,730
bring these problems too late over the
internet because well

490
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,909
it must be true it's on the internet
right we're gonna put it on the internet

491
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:43,119
and hopefully some other companies who
have been mentioned here today

492
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,059
are we'll have somebody tell them hey
there's this rant out on the internet

493
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:47,440
you should look at

494
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,820
and I'll see if that problem can't get
solved

495
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,340
now the person making around here today
will probably never get the credit

496
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,909
but because this conference has streak
red

497
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:03,139
for finding props for having corporate
agents

498
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:06,269
maybe not high level but low level
agents come here and listen

499
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:09,919
to what's going on though send their
reports

500
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,789
to the upper levels of management saying
hey you know you ought to check out

501
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:18,990
this link that's talking about us and
maybe we ought to fix that

502
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,970
will know you know probably in a month
or two

503
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,330
whether or not these things get fixed if
they do please email me

504
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:30,090
Cheshire at 2600 dot com and let me know
if

505
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,080
any of this has been effective because
as part other social experiment will be

506
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,149
the follow-on

507
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:39,330
for the social experiment and let us
know what it was worth doing again

508
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,320
at the next hope or maybe at other
conferences I may be taking on the road

509
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,428
doing around the country

510
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,570
I don't know yet this is the first

511
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,279
up this particular social experiment
with that lays gentleman

512
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,029
thank you will will break it up for love
a break between sessions

513
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:59,279
and I'll will give rubble chance to

514
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,710
do his thing 31 I want to see if what
did the plant is too broad for example

515
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,879
mine was about you know the thing

516
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:10,039
about the billing to tho not what you up
your users rant to other users and and

517
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:10,369
maybe

518
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:14,980
prize will the company needs like Google
what does he mean by that

519
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,110
we need you know like in rubble that's
why I'm gonna take the information put

520
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,610
on floppy for me the other day

521
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,040
and put it up on public rants dot com
are

522
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,460
this is why I asked for URL because in
45 seconds

523
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,520
you can simply make a quick point this
will give the people

524
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,720
who will report back to their managers a
place to look

525
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,030
for more information about the problem
this is part of the social experiment

526
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,950
that will be public rants dot com

527
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,590
we're trying to get problems fixed that

528
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,000
we've tried for years to get pics and
have not been able to do anything cuz

529
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,770
we're just the public they don't really
listen to us but because

530
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,230
the problem was voiced at a conference
hot evil

531
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:00,770
means the couple computer hackers well
they have to sit up and take notice that

532
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,280
the problem got mention

533
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,540
and that the word is out there well you
know maybe we gotta put somebody on the

534
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,650
problem and maybe

535
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,500
it'll get fixed that is what this is
about

536
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,659
this is what happens syndrome is about
getting problems

537
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:20,060
fixed are people

538
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,480
who are programs look at a computer
systems all I know what the problem is

539
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,320
with that

540
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,670
and the ship of a new email and it still
doesn't get fixed

541
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:32,120
arm sometimes the fixes

542
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,139
put more bugs into the system but then
there's more problems to fix it

543
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,509
intellectual challenge

544
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:40,510
trying to fix those problems that keeps
a hacker going exactly that's why I

545
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,070
by the time they fix it partially but
they don't really fix would

546
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,300
needs to be fixed they fix the fix it
one

547
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,230
they fix this thing the news to come in
but next the thing that the managers

548
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,199
have to look at

549
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,180
and then but then adjust their problem
wedges being other net goes away

550
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,940
it's just a weird same way again yeah
for some strange reason in with that

551
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,010
I would like to play my phone bill song
okay one moment

552
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,490
with from gonna come people who have
come up but so

553
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,700

don't really have a website for this

555
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:17,380

556
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,090
good I just like to say to all the cell
phone providers out there on the

557
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,060
internet service providers out there

558
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,900
if you advertise unlimited service you
better allow me

559
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,490
to pull down as much data as I can for
the whole month

560
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:36,050
I don't care about you know your band
with I'm paying for unlimited service

561
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,810
you should give me the unlimited service
if you want to advertise

562
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,490
I'll large service that's fine but if
you advertise unlimited service

563
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:51,490
I want unlimited service thank you one
less thing about Comcast and GE for

564

nobody's gonna watch

567
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,800
I've around that's a a little bit less
related to our technology but I think a

568
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,120
its still for a corporation on the MTA

569
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,220
while ago I don't remember how long this
was are decide to raise their fair which

570
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,630
for a long time and then I dollar 50 to
two dollars and the reason for that was

571
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,940
are they needed the money

572
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,870
but then a an investigation remember
exactly when it was on

573
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:39,120
found that they didn't really need the
money they were just being greedy

574
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,859
and the fair remains the two hours and
now I've heard there'd

575
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,490
thinking of taking away the bonuses were
few getting our measure car to get you

576
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,590
back extra so

577

590
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,040
to try to do some like bio sure
something in your goals to keep your

591
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,349
users from getting sued

592
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:00,240
or to keep people out of jail and you're
doing it based on some theory you made

593
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:00,630
up

594
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,119
of what common carrier status means or
what exactly reasonable doubt

595
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,740
is and you have not already spoken with
a couple lawyers

596
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:14,150
about whether or not you're theory comes
from Long or comes from space aliens be

597
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,150

are monitored Johnson with new yorkers
prepare use the Website there is WWW dot

602
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,060
NY pair used and/or and now I guess that
the one thing you know

603
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,880
focus on right now is some a couple
things right now

604
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,470
on the FCC is proposing actually having
regulations that cover

605
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:49,690
particular packets boys packets the
voice over IP a

606
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,240
notice for proposed rulemaking came out
about three months ago

607
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,810
between NY pair user public knowledge or
e about and find out about that

608
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,099
second arm the induced act

609
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:04,839
is on the box its its coming up for
ratification

616
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,140
a nearly constant frustration with the
lack awareness

617
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,490
in the citizenry of the United State by
this I mean the lack of

618
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:46,150
outrage over dear old voting machines
not having a paper receipt

619
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,240
the lack of outrage over the FCC
consolidation and radio

620
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,200
Clear Channel One all that stuff
frustrations at this store

621
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,580

thank you pointed out I just wanna
remark in the

631
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,349
idiocy electronic voting its its

632
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:49,770
absolutely ridiculous I read on the news
that

633
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,930
people there are people out there who
can hack into this

634
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,279
electronic voting stations and changed
everything within five minutes

635
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,339
cell animals and that there was an

636
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:07,339
do anything about that please change
occurs it's gonna ruin everything as a

637
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,000
floridian

638
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,000
love elections are run by a county board
of elections and in my county

639
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,089
it is a paper ballot that you mark and
is one the mark sense

640
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:25,190
are machines that you put a belt into
but there is that

641
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,540
paper that can be counted by hand later

642
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,420
that i think is the best way to go
special state like Florida

643
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,200
good says more generous everyone here

644
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,780
and that people running panels I can't
hope to learn about technology not to

645
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,890
learn the Bush sucks

646
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:44,750
%uh a hope I'm not the only one that
feels that way in

00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,040
corporations

658
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,460
another new one listen to Steve Kass is
on

659
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,690
presentation on how to talk to the press
talking corporations works almost

660
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,260
exactly the same way

661
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,950
if you want to get your message across
yet the talk to a personal corporation

662
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,330
other

663
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,619
in another info at email address and
stuff like that

664
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:49,560
find percent corporation you wanna
contact fun person is in charge of

665
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,770
changing something

666
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:53,869
and send not none email a hard cock
email it's

667
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:57,980
you can ignore hard cock me sits on your
desk he said

668
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,390
read it and it's got a lot more effect
than sending an email to some

669
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,960
and then the trestle if no I think that
which I'll have some more information

670
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,990
how to talk to corporations a lot more
important than

671
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,800
not getting the message across and
having a message is great you can't

672
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,050
relate properly and it's just not worth
it

673
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:18,319
for good thank you leader not a
thirty-seven cent stamp

674
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,740
is probably the best way these days
because nothing too many people reading

675
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,099
letters when they get into the
corporation's

676
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:27,920
they do move on do some me with the
moment I'm

677
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,920
done too many so if all these
advertisers

678
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,960
are collecting so much information about
me invading my privacy to do it

679
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,310
why on earth do to get anything back in
return like why don't the store

680
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:42,680
advertising things Jimmy targeted at me
I would know that this happened

681
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,279
the moment I started wanting everything
that they advertised at me

682
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,760
I C may God I can almost afford the
laptop which has been no

gotta read it instead it's still the

684
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,040
same stupid stuff they advertised
everyone else

685
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,759
the spending all this cash collecting
stuff about me and using it

686
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,940
to try to tell me about things 90
likelier to buy than the next guy

687
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:08,230

they're not even bothering

688
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:13,099
the stuff I want to buy and do not
trying

689
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:18,940

690
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,940

692
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,118
buyers considering I want to complain
about Verizon's ego

693
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,869
I paid a lot of money for this phone the
other day and on the outside a bit edged

694
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:39,599
in it it says

695
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,819
arising in case I forgot you now you
have started the timer

696
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:47,369
in case I forgot who my service provider
is I open it up and it's edged on the

697
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:48,140
inside

698
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:52,460
horizon now when I open my phone I wanna
see what time it is

699
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,800
it says Verizon Wireless across it and
then every about every few seconds

700
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,000
then it shows me the time and then it
flashes back to Verizon Wireless

701
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,440
so every time I wanna check the time on
this phone which by the way is a Samsun

702
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,990
I have to sit and stare at the words
Verizon Wireless in case I'm too stupid

703
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,520
to know what my fucking

704
