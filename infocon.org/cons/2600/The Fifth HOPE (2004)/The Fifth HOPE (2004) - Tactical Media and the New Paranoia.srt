1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:03,670
just keep answering yes i'm

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,850
usr john henry

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,119
with the institute for applied autonomy

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,559
uh... much and that they also denise
discussing the c_a_a_ which is the

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,919
critical art ensemble uh... those folks
would love to plug be here but they've

6
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:19,560
been accused of bioterrorism a can speak
probably

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,560
uh... so genentech

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,948
thanks a lot reared

9
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,290
area couple hopes ago

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,510
glad to be back

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,050
state yet three talks in an hour so
we're going to go kinda fast 'cause we

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,810
really want to leave enough room for a
good questions at the end

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,740
so uh... but all the stuff is on website
so it can be proved starr to leisure

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,750
so it's different file tommy's a
collective of engineer

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,950
uh... activists and artists

16
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:56,250
um... thrissur operate in

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,609
and opposite way that a group like dark
operates rates or cert on did

18
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:03,719
in response to what the military zation
of

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,080
of technological research

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,039
and asks her to happen 'cause we're
looking at now

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,510
the state of activism and is
increasingly looking a lot like this

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,770
right where you had

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,710
kind of a

24
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,810
a massive amount of technology
technology on one side

25
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,440
and that was kinda coming directly from
the battlefield to the streets

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,090
and then in the academic environment

27
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,250
you have the technologies being
developed by basically the same kinds of

28
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,920
activists a head like kind of young
people with really great ideas

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,720
serbian cordoned off into military
development unless technologies being

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,289
reapply it back to them in the street

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,310
so we decide to operate in the opposite
direction

32
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,560
so darpa defense advanced research
projects agency they got about three

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,220
billion dollars a year

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,610
to uh... developed military technologies
may have heard of some of them

35
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,179
the internet for instance

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,480
uh... m

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,770
so quickly got interested in uh...
powell

38
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,880
how how these things get developed of
what what you know what's our

39
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,479
conversations are going on driving them

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,910
so we decide to go to have been to the
belly of it

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,168
i'd architect their annual symposium

42
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,349
uh...

43
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,709
you considered by admission into this
and and and kind of be amongst

44
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,109
uh... the uh... the the responders and
military personnel and what not

45
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:22,829
uh... but as as many of you know

46
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:26,379
i want to get one foot in the door it's
very easy to get more feet in the door

47
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,799
if you have uh... you know

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,629
photoshop in addition printer

49
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:32,448
um...

50
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:35,989
so one of things we learned when we got
there it was that there is kind of

51
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,849
these two

52
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,929
major belief systems that everything was
relying on one was that we we need to

53
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,319
get rid of the people

54
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,059
um... they're they're the weak link in
combat systems the fleshy beings that

55
00:02:47,059 --> 00:02:48,329
need to sleep

56
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,160
uh...

57
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,069
and aren't the other side

58
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:54,119
we need to replace as many of the
remaining fleshy beings

59
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:57,129
with robots

60
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:01,018
they're they're sort of driving for you
know like a few people in the field

61
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,459
controlling many autonomous robots that
are largely making decisions on their

62
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:05,160
own

63
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,099
and israeli in back to find out exactly
which targets

64
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,239
they should be addressing or servicing
as they say

65
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,150
so uh... are all route one whenever
first initiatives was to to appropriate

66
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,129
their ideas on mobile robotics and apply
them to the streets

67
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,779
we call this constitutional robotics

68
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,480
uh... one of these robots

69
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,029
skull the robotic graffiti writer and
addresses this problem of graffiti

70
00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:32,799
reading becoming an inky pick
increasingly dangerous political act

71
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,909
people actually

72
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:36,039
serving long prison sentences

73
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,439
for uh... for writing graffiti in the
streets

74
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,948
so we developed a mobile platform

75
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,419
that operates at high speed in his skis
leary programmable with whatever you

76
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,039
want as far as your content is concerned

77
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,499
uh... we use a hacked calculator in
order to

78
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:51,029
be the keypad

79
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:54,909
that interfaces with that and you have
like a remote red button that functions

80
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,429
as the print button

81
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,019
uh... won the first

82
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,159
adolescence we we've learned the
graffiti writer was was going to to our

83
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,179
nation's capital this is about

84
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:06,069
mamet five or six years ago

85
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:08,069
and uh...

86
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:09,279
we we

87
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:13,448
the citizens of the first time you're
going to use the robot uh...

88
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:16,680
week week and i wanted to make sure we
got something good before they got taken

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,900
away

90
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:23,360
so we ought to the capitol and we kind
of bungled or way around for awhile and

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,099
kind of benchley did get the attention
of security which we didn't intend to do

92
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,308
but uh... we got caught sort of red
handed in the act of reading the message

93
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:31,900
voting is few tile

94
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,860
uh... on the steps of the capitol
building

95
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,199
uh... now

96
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,090
we we pretty much expected that that
that they did was up in this is the end

97
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,259
of it

98
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,940
we learned that because we have the
shiny piece of technology

99
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,880
uh... the the cop basically didn't know
how to deal with some kind of sent us on

100
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,270
ur our way

101
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,508
and confirm that they are now at least
up being

102
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:54,900
afraid of cops and we step he started
just kind of doing it

103
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,139
as publicly as he possibly could

104
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,300
uh... in

105
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,789
in broad daylight

106
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:05,590
we would get other people involved other
people writing graffiti to you know

107
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,280
otherwise would never do it

108
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,810
uh... we we commandeered a live
television broadcast and uh...

109
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,360
you had a web address of a austria
distinct groups

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,759
speaking on the screen for about a and a
half

111
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,779
so we took that design and decided

112
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,099
to inflate it

113
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:27,819
uh... and we'd rebuilt they are large
trailer that could print

114
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,379
texas about six feet

115
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:30,249
tall

116
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:34,319
uh... and with what we learned from our
previous experience

117
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,650
we knew that

118
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,720
that huge again as long as it looks
really slaves loans that looks

119
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,020
institutional

120
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,490
ones it doesn't look like once activists
you can get away with anything

121
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,550
so we went to the darpa grand challenge
which was uh... urease of kind of

122
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,479
military robots across the desert

123
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,669
just to serve

124
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:58,109
introduced some kind of dissident voice
into that space uh... missus basically

125
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,489
what the machine looked like

126
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:00,699
here we are

127
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:04,539
intimate in the inner circle of uh... of
the darpa grand challenge as we pulled

128
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,830
up to the gate uh... you know we look
like them we we looked like one of them

129
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,698
and uh... network they waved us through

130
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,599
uh... so let's make a long story short
this is about the finish line of the

131
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,849
uh... the darpa grand challenge here we
are

132
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,110
surprise not

133
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,299
the robot

134
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,610
uh... and the message we chose

135
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:28,129
specifically for this audience 'cause we
thought that they would get at the

136
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:29,560
zarina largely

137
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,889
engineers uh... who don't necessarily
have like the same political beliefs is

138
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,349
the funders do as many of you know

139
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:41,139
uh... so the message was that ll as mark
quote reduced a robot must not kill

140
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,199
the first love robots

141
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,150
there is a something that that that we
thought that they would uh... that they

142
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,779
would understand and relate to

143
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:54,099
uh... later research but it's just reply
dot tommy relates more specifically to

144
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,750
surveillance in public spaces

145
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,949
specifically

146
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,689
uh... cctv video surveillance of public
spaces

147
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,389
surveillance camera of the old variety
these are the the scarecrow take

148
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:09,629
surveillance cameras that doesn't even
really matter whether or not they work

149
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,620
they're supposed to

150
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,889
psychologically have an impact on you so
that you behave yourself whenever you

151
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:14,960
see them

152
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,610
uh...

153
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,789
these are kind of a newer breed of
surveillance cameras attend a blend into

154
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:19,889
the environment

155
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,840
here the ideas of course

156
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,100
your to assume that you're always under
surveillance and will always behave

157
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,649
yourself

158
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:30,369
so we felt program called icy uh...
which

159
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:32,479
basically plotted these out on a map

160
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,429
and provided that they don't have a
dynamic fashion

161
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:39,329
on the webinar that short video of this
will be the end of the i a part of the

toc

163
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:41,319
uh...

00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,699
and their is audio

165
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,639
with this video and hopefully it'll all
work

research papers and stuff for up there

170
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:12,180
thinking thinking thinking

171
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:24,900
this is uh... surveillance companies
that they said in response to this

172
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,129
project

173
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:32,699
closed-circuit television cctv
surveillance of public spaces on the

174
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:33,740
rise

175
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,490
using cameras installed on buildings
a_t_m_ machines and traffic lights

176
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,840
police officers and private security
guards monitor or every move a nineteen

177
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,450
ninety eight survey documented over
twenty four hundred cameras in new york

178
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,190
city's public places since then the
number has continued to skyrocket with

179
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,270
more cameras on the way it has become
virtually impossible to avoid cc t_v_'s

180
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,090
prying eyes

181
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,290
until now utilizing advanced artificial
intelligence technology

182
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,630
the institute for applied autonomy

183
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,710
has developed icy an inverse
surveillance system that helps people

184
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:17,279
track and avoid cctv cameras visitors to
the icy website are presented with a map

185
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,230
of new york city highlighting
surveillance camera locations

186
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,540
predictably enough the majority are in
the areas of great economic value such

187
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,319
as midtown and the financial district
even those street crime is more

188
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,540
prevalent in low-income neighborhoods
users click them now to indicate a

189
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,349

190
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,100
and i seize route planning all tourism
provides a path of least surveillance

191
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,320
avoiding as many cameras as possible
this man may be printed out

192
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,470
since his launching october of two
thousand one high-seas producing well

193
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,910
over one hundred thousand unique maps

194
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,269
in addition high-seas provoked a public
debate over cctv use in such

195
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:02,329
publications as wired magazine and the
london financial times and on web sites

196
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,709
including slashdot and foxnews i see is
also featured on you know who's travel

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,220
and transportation guide to new york
city

198
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,980
the institute for applied autonomy is
currently working to expand icy to cover

199
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,160
additional cities and to make by sea
available to wireless devices as the use

200
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,050
of cctv surveillance continues to grow
so does the need for this valuable

201
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,400
service

202
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,650
i see

203
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:34,650
now more than ever

uh...

208
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,880
uh... unlike this is andy and i think
um...

209
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,720
and john henry here said that um... the
institute for applied at tommy is a kind

210
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,310
of collaboration between activists and
artists and engineers

211
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,010
and uh... work were a bit like that
except i would say there were more like

212
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,430
a collaboration between nam

213
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,490
activist social engineers in eighty
eight's and um...

214
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,920
or alternately all play different roles
a different times

215
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,910
uh...

216
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,980
really uh... it's it's exciting to be
here

217
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,760
in a crowd that has a word

218
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,180
the describes what we doing our few
words social engineering uh...

219
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,829
we social engineer with activists

220
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:33,080
and sand we don't actually have any
particular

221
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,210
uh... we don't have goals in in mind we
start but we usually figure out our way

222
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,580
as we go along

223
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,359
uh...

224
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:44,809
or initially in refill your clip of that
explains on how we sort of stumbled into

225
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:45,810
this

226
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,770
traded uh... if you can

227
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,430
play the video

228
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:56,430
and uh... bring down the lights that
would be great

229
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,449
go abroad

230
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,430

go ahead and

374
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,629
good about the removal of the article

375
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,030
they've gone to bed with one of whom he
looked bad

376
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,510

bellwether no another long hill

379
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,440

380
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,820
parallel entity

381
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,480
and then after that

382
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,530
employment growth bowing saddleback

383
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,020
the gap is not really open ocean
patrimony directly

384
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,889
but the company and the other uh...
apparel

385
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,820
republican voluntarily

386
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,800
a lot of the vote

387
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,340
that the other

388
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,389
language condolences independent dr

389
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,399
moran

390
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,600
an

391
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,040
well cared essay about the uh... quality
of the video there we will miss a

392
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,190
brother

393
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,500
shitty dub

394
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,440
but um anyway uh... the shocking thing
that came out of this is you know we

395
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,780
expected that we would go into this
context for people thought that we were

396
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,480
the world trade organization

397
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,210
and now it's all of these plans which
satirize insisting programs of the

398
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,660
w_t_o_

399
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,770
we expect that people be shocked and
outraged these were trade law experts in

400
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,389
the audience but instead of being
shocked and outraged they simply

401
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,320
applauded politely and gave us a pat on
the back

402
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,159
and throughout the rest of our time at
this conference we continued to try to

403
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,190
push them in goad them into hating the
w_t_o_ and doing something that would

404
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,780
indicate their displeasure with all of
the the programs that we are announcing

405
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,370
uh... but all along we could not push
them far enough we found that we had so

406
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,769
much a story

407
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,830
as the world trade organization

408
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,300
that none of these trade law experts
were either willing to say anything

409
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,920
against what we're saying

410
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,909
or or willing to go against that so

411
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:09,789
this is a sort of shocking social
experiment a little bit like n the

412
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:13,970
milligram experiment but where if we're
sort of living in it

413
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,000
and uh... after this happened once we
decided that it was easy enough to

414
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,290
continue

415
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,850
to answer these invitations and go and
represent the w_t_o_ and a number of

416
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,560
different context so

417
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,679
uh... this is a sort of underground
video that we made there was an

418
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,940
afterthought we just had the video as a
sort of witness of the event

419
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,350
and uh... for the following uh... events
where we wanna represented the w_t_o_

420
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,290
and

421
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,289
places like that textiles conference in
finland and he was on cnbc

422
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:44,890
market wrap your

423
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:51,380
debating an anti globalization activist

424
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,910
among the other kind of venues and he
was is that

425
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,050
in all adult service spiraled out of
control and and we continue to sort of

426
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,550
of the w_t_o_ try to push things

427
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:06,440
further and further try to push the
ideas of the w_t_o_ to their logical

428
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:12,260
conclusion although while trying to
highlight the uh... continued to pound

429
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,379
descriptive disparity between rich and
poor or that the w_t_o_

430
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,970
policies promote

431
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,260
uh... and of course all the while we
found out that that

432
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,450
no matter what we said or what we did

433
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,110
that people still simply wouldn't agree
with what the w_t_o_ set which indicates

434
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,740
that we are of course anna

435
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:35,890
engager crisis of information and ideas
in the world especially in that context

436
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,429
in the context of

437
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,160
experiences

438
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,570
uh...

439
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,360
so i anyway that's all the subject of a
movie that's gonna be coming out and

440
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,320
uh... at the end of the summer united
artists is putting out its documentary

441
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,110
about these uh...

442
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,520
weirdness social engineering experiments

443
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,760
europe which

444
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,350
of in the name of the movie is the yes
man

445
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,990
information about the movie in the

446
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,080
and us

447
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,350
uh... at the yes man dot org

448
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,330
and uh...

449
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,228
bridges can introduce a third group

450
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:15,470
on and some of them said

451
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,700
beef on them

452
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,350
another group that does uh... that like

453
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,200
ascent

454
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
okay

455
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,430
on has taken on a major

456
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,110
kind of economic power in the world
today

457
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,250
and use sixteenths

458
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,430
clarify them

459
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,830
as society may have heard about the
uh... situation ever our friends in

460
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,309
critical art ensemble

461
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:37,139
uh... neighboring

462
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,919
familiar to you

463
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,350
uh... creek learn some bles a collective
again of artists

464
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,920
uh... working interdisciplinary lee

465
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,240
with uh...

466
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,690
experts and various fields and for the
last

467
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,640
five or six years they've been working
specifically in the field of

468
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,070
biotechnology

469
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,189
uh... basically they're interested in
getting people too

470
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,010
think critically about how these
technologies get used and what sort of

471
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,790
agenda's director jerk is driving their
development

472
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,590
but also to educate them and demystify
the technology so that that's

473
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,220
the position is not that any technology
is good or bad it's at the technology

474
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,289
should be understood by the public

475
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:22,600
and we should consider who's in control
of that technology

476
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,320
very simple idea

477
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,010
uh... this project

478
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,039
that that's in the picture here is
called free range grains

479
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,960
now when they do these performances
quite often they take on the guys uh...

480
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,230
of a corporation

481
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:37,399
uh... or

482
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,080
assaults in one case

483
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,149
uh... but

484
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,740
and that sort of the the voice that
people are sort of see it coming from

485
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,590
the nazi bunch artists they see whatever
at this identity they're taking on so

486
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,890
there's this element social engineering
there

487
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,780
uh... in this case

488
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,300
they uh...

489
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,240
their doings performed scot free range
greens in which they invite people to

490
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,279
bring organic produce

491
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,059
to the gallery or museum where ever it
is that they're they're they're doing

492
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:04,600
this performance sometimes they do it
farmers markets

493
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,710
uh...

494
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,890
uh... briefings they're labeled organic

495
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:13,120
and data net test them genetically for
d_n_a_ that's present and genetically

496
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,130
modified

497
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,590
corn or whatever the uh... the food is

498
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,760
and quite often

499
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,460
they they test positive

500
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,309
and fact regularly they test positive

501
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:25,500
so

502
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,140
list this project they've done kind of a
number of environments most recently

503
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,320
this was at them

504
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,210
uh... massachusetts

505
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,680
what is a calm these

506
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,620
masters at some

507
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,760
mass mocha

508
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,200
uh...

509
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,480
big art museum but i think there are
there to see this exhibit you'll see

510
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,590
have big

511
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,909
empty space actually because the entire
contents of this

512
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:49,049
exhibit are now in the possession of the
f_b_i_

513
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,799
we'll find out why that is momentarily

514
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,750
uh... another project just to give you
an idea of the kind of work that is

515
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,490
called jen terra

516
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,850
in this case they took on the identity

517
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,659
uh... they ate a transgenic ps

518
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:05,249
corporations ah... suspect they're doing
they're creating genetically modified

519
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,899
organisms taking the d_n_a_ from one
organism

520
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:09,179
sticking it in to that

521
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:10,530
d_n_a_ of an order one

522
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:13,430
seeing what happens that's that's
basically sort of how

523
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:16,360
how transgenic sports in a nutshell
uh...

524
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,519
and what they do in these performances

525
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,970
is they set up as this company doing
scott of public

526
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,590
public interactions with people and like
say a natural history museum for example

527
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,630
and uh... and looks a lot like this they
you know they have lab technicians

528
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,700
and people

529
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,750
are sort of educated and a little bit
about how transgenic swore tx

530
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,100
and they're presented with this machine

531
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,500
and it's its

532
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,000
has a design of a laboratory machine but
it functions also a bit like a roulette

533
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,820
wheel

534
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,320
there's a spinning

535
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,658
table of uh...

536
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:49,379
petri dishes each petri dish contains

537
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:52,850
a bacterial culture some of them
transgenic some of the not

538
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,730
but the transgenic once

539
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,039
like i said you can't meet demand out
one thing sticking it to be the other

540
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,629
you don't know necessarily what's going
to happen

541
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,340
this is this process is

542
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,580
repeated in transgenic slabs all over
the world thousands of times a day

543
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,270
there's is very very slim chance that
something bad could happen it could be a

544
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,809
very alert strain that you've created
sperry small chance

545
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,830
thousands of times a day right

546
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,530
there's no sort of oversight their risk
assessment sociated with this

547
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,789
so they present people

548
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:25,100
with this dilemma

549
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,860
and this kind of roulette wheel

550
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,690
are they willing to press the button and
released this unknown

551
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,970
bacterial culture into the atmosphere
very small chance but the question that

552
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,600
they're posing to people is do you trust
the scientists are not

553
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,400
one thing to ask that is a theoretical
question

554
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,799
but you know you learn a lot more and
you really consider the issues affair

555
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:50,519
actually posed with that as a as a
functional question

556
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,340
so this is the kinds of work

557
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,990
that they've been doing for the last

558
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,660
five or six years these are dedicated to
advocating the public

559
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,099
about these technologies

560
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:03,309
demystifying them so that we don't have
a situation where you've got people that

561
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:04,710
are

562
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,130
just have a general fear of
biotechnology in genetically modified

563
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,440
organisms without understanding why and
you don't have

564
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,100
the corporations on the other side that
have no oversight no risk assessment

565
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,630
it's not educating the public so they
can make informed policy decisions

566
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,180
these bacterial cultures

567
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,980
were kept in steve's house

568
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,030
this is where he conducts his lab as any

569
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,639
does he use the space available to you

570
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,180
your hacker you got you know your
computer at home it's that's that's

571
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,450
that's where you do your work

572
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,559
in your studio

573
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,649
uh...

574
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,850
and

575
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:46,070
a terrible thing happened uh... may
eleventh just just a few months ago

576
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,100
uh... steve

577
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,490
kurtz of creek learned sample woke up

578
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,450
to find his wife was no longer breathing

579
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,500
and

580
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,539
he called the uh... he called the
paramedics called nine one one

581
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,379
they came to his house

582
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,520
and

583
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,240
they saw these these these petri dishes

584
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,150
that the police also come when there's a
that dot in the house

585
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,660
uh...

586
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,250
ship died of a heart attack your sleep

587
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,099
and unrelated to any of this as

588
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:13,639
everyone agrees to this point

589
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,560
but the police saw the petri dishes they
call the f_b_i_ the f_b_i_ called the

590
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,509
joint terrorism task force

591
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:19,889
and before you know it like

592
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:22,260
two blocks of steve's neighborhood are
roped off

593
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,330
steve's an f_b_i_ custody and

594
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,039
guys and has met seats

595
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,530
uh... coming to his house

596
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,520
confiscating the lab

597
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,400
his computers his books

598
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,750
his wife's body

599
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,769
and uh...

600
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:43,100
after a few days they announce that the
house is is clean it's not uh...

601
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,470
presented no threat to the public

602
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,470
uh... the bacterial cultures that were
present was a strain of e_ coli strain

603
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,460
of us are right here anna strain of
bacillus

604
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,090
atrophy s

605
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,730
these are all harmless strains that are
available from

606
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,670
scientific

607
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,360
distributors to sell a sort of thing

608
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,220
uh... but

609
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,809
an f_b_i_ investigation continued

610
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,519
and

611
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,918
suddenly steeple started getting
subpoenas

612
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,129
uh... everybody associated with the
group

613
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:15,779
was a very wide net was cast everyone

614
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:17,510
uh... from students

615
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,759
of steve too

616
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:22,789
uh... the publisher of his books

617
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:23,859
uh...

618
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:27,379
and i'll be enough it seemed like
everybody that was able to speak

619
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:31,659
publicly about the case started
receiving subpoenas as well

620
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,609
when you get a risk at a subpoena if you
don't intend to uh...

621
00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:37,940
if you tend to plead the fifth you gotta
stop talking to the press

622
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,699
uh...

623
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:42,249
so

624
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:47,939
uh... so grand jury hearing was was was
formed and uh...

625
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:49,308
people were in him

626
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:51,310
yet to come out and about the business

627
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,049
process has probably been experienced by
number of people here and we want to

628
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,049
hear from you after richard and tones
tale

629
00:34:57,049 --> 00:34:58,339
um...

630
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:00,429
but the uh... the grand jury hearing

631
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:03,599
uh... was presented with this evidence
they're presented with all these people

632
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,029
and being subpoenaed in talking about
the case

633
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:07,849
uh... and

634
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:09,230
the charges might from

635
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,460
being bioterrorism which is what

636
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,989
was listed on the subpoenas i'm sorry i
didn't mention that

637
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:18,239
uh... on that on the subpoenas he was he
was being charged with bioterrorism

638
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,110
under the bar terror weapons act of
nineteen eighty nine

639
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,940
which

640
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,069
had been modified by the patriot act

641
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:25,800
such that

642
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,000
you didn't have to actually be in
possession of anything dangerous putting

643
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,050
the patriot act you don't have to be in
possession of a biological agent without

644
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:38,180
a peaceful purpose so if you have yogurt
you intend to harm someone with yogurt

645
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,029
urine by a large actually you know you
have to attend the harmonies can have a

646
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:43,950
peaceful purpose you have a neutral
purpose and still fall into that

647
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,939
category

648
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:48,439
um...

649
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:51,908
so there that the grand jury hearing was
presented to this evidence and he

650
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:54,469
eventually was indicted recently

651
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:56,919
but the charge had changed radically

652
00:35:56,919 --> 00:36:00,339
from by a tear to mail fraud

653
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:01,210
uh...

654
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,000
and that may be sound familiar to many
of you because that's that's the charge

655
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,639
they usually use against

656
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,250
mobsters and people for which they can
actually convective

657
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,879
anything else that something that just
about anybody can get convicted of

658
00:36:14,879 --> 00:36:18,618
anna's related to how he got the
bacterial cultures basically he called

659
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:20,699
the company

660
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:23,789
they wouldn't sell into an individual
'cause they don't deal with individuals

661
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:24,899
i mean

662
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:28,640
plots of the invite printer toner that
want sultan individualists all the

663
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
university's said is

664
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,509
microbiologist guy that is collaborating
with on the project at him by it

665
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:38,449
somehow that-that's that's uh...

666
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:40,530
that's become the core of the case

667
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,020
uh... anyway uh... a lot of people have
come together all over the world

668
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,309
an order call attention to this case

669
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:48,499
because

670
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:50,069
at it is

671
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:53,880
just the most classical example i no of
right now

672
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,880
about about politicized voice being
being silenced as a result of of these

673
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:04,140
legislations that were passed under a
very paranoid

674
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,430
period in history

675
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,290
uh...

676
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,540
so there's a group called the uh... see
a defense fund

677
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,879
that was formed c_d_-eight he defense
fund the dot

678
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:14,750
uh...

679
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,030
and you can call the case more press
releases

680
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,599
uh... and i'll

681
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,019
maybe invite the s men to come up and
talk about how that's been organized

682
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:24,799
monks all these

683
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:30,339
different groups all over the world

684
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:34,779
yeah basically that's the whole story
and on the sea defence fund is just

685
00:37:34,779 --> 00:37:36,909
doing all it can't hurt

686
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:40,739
uh... make the make more more people
aware of the situation

687
00:37:40,739 --> 00:37:44,880
i'm in all its ramifications and if
there are people here hasn't sure

688
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,929
they're quite a few good

689
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:48,529
experience is that

690
00:37:48,529 --> 00:37:53,259
on this reminds them of in some way
uh... with the f_b_i_ or other agencies

691
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:58,460
we'd love to talked if he could write if
you like writing to media at c eighty

692
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,259
defense fund dot org and sharing your
information your your ideas

693
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:03,479
arm

694
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,299
could be useful to

695
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:10,439
uh... perhaps the case itself and
perhaps arm

696
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:12,149
our work in in

697
00:38:12,149 --> 00:38:16,130
uh... spreading the word ng threatening
getting in their own returned a

698
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,169
compile

699
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,269
uh...

700
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:20,620
footage of the center

701
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,348
various forms that

702
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:26,589
we could get out there so i guess we'll
just uh... take questions and clarify

703
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:33,589
what we can clarify it

704
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,440
person and that he did

705
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,920
if you could stuck into the mic because
that they'd like to record the questions

706
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:49,920
as well

707
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,650
you'd you monthly and you have to get
the right to talk to the press

708
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,759
in one sentence

709
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:00,599
people just to matter

710
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,480
when it comes

711
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,870
okay that's not a legal requirement it's
just sound legal advice uh... if if you

712
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,409
continue talking the press after you've
played the fifth

713
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:12,379
i mean plead the fifth is uh...

714
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:15,058
you know you have the right not to
incriminate yourself

715
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:15,809
uh... and

716
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,849
by by not speaking so if you can take
you to talk to the press

717
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:21,819
your you are

718
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,279
it's hard to make the case in the
courtroom

719
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:30,449
betty you can't speak about the issue

720
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:32,040
but potentially that could

721
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,729
that could be brought into the courtroom
and used against you in the future

722
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:38,719
and the reason people plead the fifth is
because during a grand jury hearing

723
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,929
actually don't know what the charges are

724
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:45,469
and you don't know if you are in fact
the church becoming as a witness

725
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:49,539
you don't know how far the the the
dragons being cast for instance

726
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:53,200
people were brought into the courtroom
to talk about bioterrorism and help the

727
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,819
other and they're talking about

728
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:59,179
a state technicality in a male
transaction

729
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:02,099
and there is no opportunity for

730
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:05,159
your defense to make its decision on

731
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,099
but

732
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:09,449
in a grand jury indictment he there
there is uh... you can't your lawyer

733
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:13,089
can't be there to represent your
position so one-sided thanks for the

734
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:14,210
prosecution

735
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,259
can ask any question that one

736
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,819
and the only ask questions that they
know the answer to that corso

737
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:25,409
uh... they can present a very one-sided
case to the grand jury and almost all

738
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:29,179
grand juries and in indictments for that
reason

739
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,359
skits

740
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,639
did we mention that this this case is
already going for the arraignment has

741
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:35,960
just happened and

742
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,950
there might be more charges brought we
don't know what they will be but there's

743
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,939
definitely gonna be a trial

744
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:45,069
soul so worth noting that the mail fraud
church uh... as a result of the and run

745
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:46,399
situation

746
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:50,419
uh... the legislation was amended such
that the penalty for single count the

747
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:53,259
maxim totally went from five years to
twenty years

748
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:57,129
so while under the buyer tera weapons

749
00:40:57,129 --> 00:41:01,229
the maximum penalty was i believe ten
years

750
00:41:01,229 --> 00:41:02,459
uh...

751
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:04,359
now is being charged with four counts

752
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:08,078
related to this single male transaction
which as max from penalty if eighty

753
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,039
years

754
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,749
morning i'm actually a question for the
yes men home i've been following what

755
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:17,709
you've been doing for a long time and
again in front of your work

756
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,868
and um... because with uh... with the
with the movie coming out soon do you

757
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:24,900
think that's gonna blow things open too
far for you to continue doing what it

758
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,509
what it is that uh... you doing

759
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,849
probably not know on this

760
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:34,579
there's one point in the movie where
were were showing footage of uh...

761
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:38,009
mine counter with that tech local
station activist on t_v_ was showing

762
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:42,109
footage of adding counter to the entire
globalisation activist in his office in

763
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:42,989
london

764
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:47,349
and he doesn't know this even though i'm
dressed exactly the same in it's it's

765
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,850
just

766
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,899
human tendency not to

767
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:51,828
to expect

768
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:56,129
somebody there is right you just don't
think about that sort of thing so

769
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:59,179
think also a fake moustache something
could help but other people can do it

770
00:41:59,179 --> 00:42:02,589
just as easily as we can to it it
doesn't take any special talent to do

771
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:04,549
that sort of thing so

772
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:07,489
a fungus which would be that yes we've

773
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:12,069
do it anymore and i think people will

774
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:16,729
i have a question about why people are
so against genetically monthly foods in

775
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:17,629
general

776
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:21,929
united here i'm of the believe that that
knowledge in the world a better place

777
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:24,359
ninety computers are found ways but
really

778
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,319
it's about making a better world and i
think you know people not starving to

779
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,308
death makes the world a lot better than
anything else we can possibly do

780
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:35,869
and the only way to feed six billion
people

781
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:39,099
uh... i i i don't think that natural
props can do it i mean even modifying

782
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,009
the food that we eat over thousands of
years of agriculture through selection

783
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:44,139
anyway

784
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:47,139
you know why cant technology make this
better you know what why does it have to

785
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:48,289
be evil

786
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:50,469
bulletin

787
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:52,269
we all want to answer that

788
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,389
uh... but we also don't like

789
00:42:54,389 --> 00:42:57,049
that's a big can of worms rape

790
00:42:57,049 --> 00:43:00,420
so it's it's it's like we're saying it's
not in that matter that being

791
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,199
computer bad it's about our matter to be
proper oversight

792
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:08,329
you there's there's no understanding of
how

793
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:11,649
and the critical art ensemble sperry
clear about uh... and if you in a

794
00:43:11,649 --> 00:43:15,949
message in error could not quite species
into the environment

795
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:19,229
there's very little way of predicting
exactly how the rest of the americans

796
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,999
can react to that species

797
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:22,849
uh... for that reason

798
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:27,359
their there needs to be testing period
or something but right now there there

799
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,779
is not there is no oversight of the
cutest put your crops out there

800
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:33,449
animal cited as the test sites

801
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:37,239
d_n_a_ hands up in their neighboring
farmers feel they can actually see that

802
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,029
person for violating their patent

803
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:40,469
uh...

804
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:41,410
so

805
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,339
so you're saying they should be over
certainly should be testing

806
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:47,909
and then you're complaining that they're
doing testing

807
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:51,949
you sent a test deals testimony in the
atmosphere

808
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:55,630
like an outdoor test field where does it
actually interacts with the rest the

809
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:59,599
environment yet anderson signs in their
sciences testing this testing one when

810
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,349
it's under the control inter-league
monsanto

811
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:05,670
and there's no oversight of that process
animal

812
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,869
i don't trust

813
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:09,629
abstract

814
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:11,890
notions of science enough to assume that
book

815
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:15,399
monsanto doing science is the same as

816
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:19,229
sauces that we don't trust anyone center
does not want to feed the world they

817
00:44:19,229 --> 00:44:26,229
want to sell food cultural

818
00:44:26,979 --> 00:44:30,209
and also your idea that

819
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:34,390
crop that we need to medically modified
crops in order to feed the world there

820
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,658
are a lot of experts who dispute that

821
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:43,659
there's a lot of extra fuel dispute
anything

822
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,659
i'm just wondering if

823
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:52,569
if found culture jamming and uh... the
use of satire to uh...

824
00:44:52,569 --> 00:44:54,509
bills for you

825
00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:56,779
is uh...

826
00:44:56,779 --> 00:45:00,059
something that just seems to be

827
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:02,829
you know something that would be of
people who are left leaning continue

828
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:05,829
helping them for any

829
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:08,519
right wing culture jamming

830
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:09,639
uh... war

831
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:14,249
any rightly equivalents of uh... uh...

832
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:16,500
the anyway we were going to do the kind
of

833
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,939
secure cool stuff that you guys do

834
00:45:18,939 --> 00:45:20,299
and also

835
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:22,589
also um...

836
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:26,449
how one

837
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:29,549
have you felt any kind of like the

838
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:33,029
have you felt like the the tentacles of

839
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:35,979
the occurred administration

840
00:45:35,979 --> 00:45:37,839
you know the loopholes

841
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,470
you too close to you for

842
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,299
you had a and annual unpleasant counters

843
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:45,149
that's right

844
00:45:45,149 --> 00:45:48,669
i can tell is a really strange on the
right wing

845
00:45:48,669 --> 00:45:54,328
culture jamming activism story who
recently went to uh... chicago

846
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:58,769
to the heritage foundation resource bank
meeting in the heritage foundation is

847
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:02,079
one of the largest right wing think
tanks and twenty five million dollar a

848
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,299
year budget

849
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:07,769
uh... we walked in and then uh... there
was a group there a group of protesters

850
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:10,219
when our street seats

851
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:13,929
and uh... we thought well this is
amazing protesters when we can go up and

852
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:18,189
talk to them and kinda let him know that
were actually undercover reno and see if

853
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:23,549
we have some affinity the turned out
that there are attempts hired by a group

854
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:27,489
whose goal today and a group that side
in favor of what's called school choice

855
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:30,490
but underline their goals of school
choice is

856
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,430
what they call dismantling the welfare
state so you wanna they want to actually

857
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,549
dismantled public education

858
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:38,999
and put it in the hands of private
education

859
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:41,059
but mom they hired

860
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:45,059
abroad a bunch of acting as he didn't
know that they were actually playing the

861
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:47,059
role of of supporting

862
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,960
uh... anti-gun anti-poverty will
initiate it

863
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,519
so that might be considered edited

864
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,509
i don't know an example of them

865
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:57,799
a kind of right wing culture jamming
because they even fooled us we thought

866
00:46:57,799 --> 00:47:01,900
these were genuine activists wearing
ostrich states it was uh...

867
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:07,049
african-american young women that they
had put in these ostrich seats with

868
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:11,739
signs that said we need to fix you know
uh... fix public schools and fix uh...

869
00:47:11,739 --> 00:47:13,709
social security as well

870
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:14,948
so it's quite at

871
00:47:14,949 --> 00:47:18,509
quite strange uh... experience

872
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:20,589
tentacles arm

873
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:24,729
basically this case is the first time we
felt really threatened like

874
00:47:24,729 --> 00:47:27,050
week we set up a a website

875
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,859
attacking george bush in the first
campaign

876
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:30,910
for the stolen

877
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,279
the uh...

878
00:47:32,279 --> 00:47:33,609
the eat

879
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:34,589
he lashed out

880
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:38,099
in various ways including saying there
ought to be in the midst of freedom and

881
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:41,849
asking for uh... with the federal
elections commission to

882
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:42,740
two bands

883
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,579
assessor political action committee that
was not feeling its funding and so on

884
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:47,460
um...

885
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,549
the fifty dollars a kiss would pay for
the domain name

886
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:55,509
that that was the closest we came to you
know i was just look stupid lashing out

887
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:58,330
so with this case now we're filling

888
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:02,569
how their they're paying attention to
this this group in a really heavy handed

889
00:48:02,569 --> 00:48:05,829
uh... outrageous way and who knows where
that could stop

890
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,639
now now that's our feeling was never
really felt

891
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:09,560
that before

892
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,279
anything like that

893
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:18,180
uh... you know just so former question i
have a comment for the garber pensioner

894
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,410
tomorrow five

895
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:24,730
so think about him one central's putting
pesticides invested in the twenty

896
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:28,589
engineering versus what was the
naturally in the past

897
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:32,929
question about the world dot our plans
are or those broomsticks opens move on

898
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:34,789
your website

899
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:36,349
there are plans bitten

900
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:40,109
we wrote the plans before re actually
made machine

901
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:43,899
uh... so use at your own risk

902
00:48:43,899 --> 00:48:45,589
yet but there's there's like unit

903
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:50,159
civil code for the software and basic
design of how the how the the machine

904
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:54,079
works i'm we don't have like specific
plans for how you machine individual

905
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,559
parts and fortunately

906
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,469
dependent on with all of the show

907
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:04,749
uh... somebody recently sort of modified
our design and seemingly has done it

908
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:07,500
with off-the-shelf parts as a student
parsons

909
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,449
uh... that on the back of a bicycle

910
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:15,459
um... and i haven't actually seen it
close but at it works really well

911
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:18,089
search around for that

912
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:19,328
i think was that

913
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:23,119
i forgot the name of the book

914
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,749
right now but against bush is the name
of the group

915
00:49:26,749 --> 00:49:29,919
bikes ok bikes against bush dot org

916
00:49:29,919 --> 00:49:32,879
kurt vonnegut's book about the guy who
with that

917
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,719
nazi

918
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,429
plant and not to plan in germany who
actually inspired

919
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:40,089
allotted beyond

920
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:42,349
mt jewish

921
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:45,629
are you guys from earlier with a book
and he thought about can you inspired

922
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:47,400
anybody

923
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,189
monica entries in your

924
00:49:49,189 --> 00:49:50,848
pretending to be

925
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:54,459
people is anyone's that cool that's a
really good idea keep in mind for net

926
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:57,489
back to my country

927
00:49:57,489 --> 00:50:01,559
uh... not swordfish

928
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,369
we defense release

929
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,579
no i mean bt

930
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:10,639
the answers is interesting there were
there was a lot of going along with

931
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,289
things were saying but we didn't get the
feeling that anybody was just jumping

932
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:14,980
for

933
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,420
joy at our thoughts and

934
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,479
and expanding on them and so on until we
took

935
00:50:19,479 --> 00:50:23,499
the opposite asked and decided this we
were never going to get through them

936
00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:27,939
satire was never going to work and so we
tried to be sincere and express as the

937
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:30,759
world trade organization what the world
trade organization

938
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:32,439
would do if it were us

939
00:50:32,439 --> 00:50:33,808
and so

940
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:37,469
you can see in the movie going to spend
that world trade organization and then

941
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:41,239
people really did jump for joy peace
accountants that we were speaking to

942
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,929
were thrilled and gave us lots of ideas
and

943
00:50:43,929 --> 00:50:45,569
uh...

944
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:47,319
probly took it with them in some way

945
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:49,879
so some interesting

946
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:51,939
statement about what

947
00:50:51,939 --> 00:50:56,138
what makes sense to people

948
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:58,290
i have an observation to make about
uh...

949
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,180
genetic engineering

950
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,869
correctly anybody and speak but it was
watching quickly discovered that you

951
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:05,089
know

952
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:11,489
when these did uh... discovered is but
you know

953
00:51:11,489 --> 00:51:14,579
when there is with the supposition was
that would be a woman to woman

954
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,719
correspondence between genes and
proteins

955
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:19,309
and most of our

956
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:23,879
understanding and knowledge and science
is built on that supposition

957
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:28,009
when the finally become the human genome
we discover that yours

958
00:51:28,009 --> 00:51:35,009
two-thirds more proteins and there are
chains

959
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:40,399
they're scrambling like mad to drive up
with something but basically we don't

960
00:51:40,399 --> 00:51:47,399
know what we're doing

961
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:52,130
i was just wondering if i hear you were
involved in the recent canadian supreme

962
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,249
court case uh... around a break rocks
and if there are any similar cases going

963
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:57,159
on

964
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:58,969
don't know about

965
00:51:58,969 --> 00:52:02,890
silicates going on but that that was an
inspiration for doing the free range

966
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:06,239
trains project for critical art ensemble

967
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,789
people don't know that our unfamiliar
with this case monsanto

968
00:52:09,789 --> 00:52:12,240
uh... managed to sue a neighboring
farmer

969
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,609
there was an organic farmer because
they're

970
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,940
copyrighted d_n_a_ was turning up in his

971
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,500
his foods he wasn't planting these that
they were just the seeds were blowing

972
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:25,919
into his fields like seats tend to do

973
00:52:25,919 --> 00:52:29,618
and i i actually don't do you happen to
know what the outcome of the crickets

974
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:36,619
was 'cause i think one central one

975
00:52:39,419 --> 00:52:40,549
time arm

976
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:42,670
i'm not necessarily against

977
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,260
genetic engineering but i think everyone
in this room should know and i really

978
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,099
don't want to beat a dead horse

979
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:54,689
but american makes another crops and
food to feed entire world

980
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:56,949
not necessary

981
00:52:56,949 --> 00:53:01,419
and military so i believe

982
00:53:01,419 --> 00:53:05,949
the problem is poverty and american
corporations do not want to give away

983
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:12,949
food

984
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:17,749
among your story of uh... what happened
to steve is uh...

985
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:20,799
actually very worrying it sounds to me
is that he is in really serious

986
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,299
situation

987
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:27,719
is the uh... in jail nam was out on bail
and secondly what kind of do you have a

988
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:30,759
strong legal assistance

989
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:34,079
he's he's got an excellent attorney as
attorneys

990
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,119
also larry flint security and marilyn
manson tutoring

991
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:38,860
uh...

992
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:41,569
he's not in is not in custody he's at
home

993
00:53:41,569 --> 00:53:43,019
uh... he ki

994
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:46,199
that's the charges were downgraded
friend

995
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:49,919
downgrade there's change and that that
the mail fraud charge even though it

996
00:53:49,919 --> 00:53:55,379
carries a potentially enormous penalty
of the bail was was extremely small any

997
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:59,039
action to only has to post it i think if
he doesn't show

998
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:04,859
sir turnaround for the new talking about
in the world at this point

999
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:07,410
he goes to prison these these charges
also have

1000
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:11,240
mandatory minimums associated with them
and they are felonies and these aren't

1001
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,249
necessarily the last charges that will
be brought against in the indictment

1002
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:16,859
could continue

1003
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:21,058
uh... i i'd like to not just recommend
that people go check out the updates for

1004
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:25,369
this etsy eighty defense fund dot org

1005
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:29,769
and now you can follow that the case
there and i think it's a case that does

1006
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:35,069
retains a everybody who is involved in
hacking because uh... in a sense uh...

1007
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:37,689
these guys that critical art ensemble

1008
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:40,899
fired in a kind of uh... webware hacking

1009
00:54:40,899 --> 00:54:42,288
uh... and i think that

1010
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:46,809
that this case could set precedent that
would affect all of us cell

1011
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:53,809
second pollen please

1012
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:59,409
coming up in a couple director computing
panel
