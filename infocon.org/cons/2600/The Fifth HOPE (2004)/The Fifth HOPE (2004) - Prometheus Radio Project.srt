that are trying to get some real radio
back on the air since its altered in the

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,220
crap channel

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,750

af

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,220
uh... how everybody

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,010
i'm my name is josh markets and i i'm a
volunteer for the previous rear project

27
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,610
i'm very excited to be here at that
packer conference of hope talking about

28
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,380
me theater project because i think that
there's a really exciting parallel

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,979
between per meteors and what i hear from
a lot of people here

30
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,030
previous started as radio pirates who
were breaking the law 'cause a lot was

31
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,869
stupid

32
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:37,240
on and their experience up against the
law

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,630
galvanize them in this struggle to free
the airwaves

34
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,850
and one thing i hear half people talking
about again the gang here

35
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,420
the knowledge that people have

36
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,979
regardless of andries

37
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,320
a man experiences to figure out like how
actually change the system so it's

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,620
exciting

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,060
detection

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,499
some picnic optics let's talk about on

41
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:05,340
let's it's are permitted out uh... the
previous radio project and where began

42
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,120
in what it is

43
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,949
took me previous began of the seeds of
previous again

44
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:15,659
as radio mutiny which was up our radio
station now the philadelphia i'm it was

45
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,668
an exciting stage and it had music it
had news it covered primarily the west

46
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:22,790
philadelphia area

47
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,049
and there was an exciting thing im

48
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,349
they had a real diversity of voices on
the air which is really exciting for us

49
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,469
to come

50
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:33,279
from young people the old people more
than thirty communities

51
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:36,019
but a troubling example uh...

52
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:40,030
comes from of one-woman show who is in
the g_o_p_ in a mom

53
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,180
i mean she had a news show and ah...
music show

54
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,280
i mean she was on the air for good long
time

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,230
and and after there were some conflicts
with the f_c_c_ because the f_c_c_

56
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,149
started cracking down on the station

57
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,190
she stops showing up to our show and upi
traditional wishes here's no start uh...

58
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,049
hoping he'll be here soon

59
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:00,870
past her y

60
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,570
she wasn't showing up anymore and she
this basically explained that initiate

61
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,109
immigration problems

62
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,389
uh... and she was concerned that if she
was caught being involved

63
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:11,739
with the station

64
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:13,700
permit recent tested the

65
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,860
uh... in jeopardy

66
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,560
and sure they were trying to build the
station to give voice to the

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,030
disenfranchised voice the voice list and
this woman who is providing wonderful

68
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,139
show was scared to be on the air and
that lassen uh...

69
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,689
really heart petri dish in the other
people who started the previous reader

70
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:30,450
project

71
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,700
there was important actually change the
system that higher radio is exciting and

72
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,570
important

73
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,120
but it doesn't actually give voice to
all the people who should have

74
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,379
their voice on the air

75
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,269
and uh...

76
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,910
the media system in which a few
corporations have their voice and no

77
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:49,478
other voices out there all the time was
no longer acceptable

78
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,299
because of previous is mission and their
representations involvement with other

79
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,869
stations

80
00:03:55,869 --> 00:04:00,279
they got involved in the lp offend
movement bright when it began

81
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,259
and they were involved in the latest
legislative process a number of years

82
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:03,980
ago

83
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,370
the originally we had to low-power f_m_
stations being put on the air by the

84
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,279
f_c_c_

85
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:14,978
low-power f_m_ stations are ten one
hundred watch stations

86
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:19,489
lessened by the f_c_c_ the broadcaster
affectively like pirate stations but

87
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:19,970
they are

88
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,569
legitimate or unquote

89
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,239
one problem is when the that wall was
passed

90
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:29,770
the the um... jesse helms i think in
particular uh...

91
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,758
wonderful center

92
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,080
uh... added a rider to that bill

93
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,840
severely restricting how many stations
became could be put on the air

94
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,240
but some stations were put on the air
and from u_p_s_ committed itself both to

95
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,520
going around the country getting people
to apply for those licenses and actually

96
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,930
going in building the stations are
building the stations with people and

97
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:55,930
also continuing the fight to open the
airwaves

98
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:00,060
tonight at about the banking elastic now

99
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,730
uh... articulate let's talk let's talk
about the lawsuit coming bump olmert

100
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,440
dharma talk about this mostly loma what
these wonder

101
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,490
uh... brings onto the table is making
sure your project has been in the media

102
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,370
recently

103
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,250
because

104
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,880
uh... remember years ago from u_p_s_
actually sued the f_c_c_

105
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,599
uh... it was represented by a group of
the media access project

106
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,370
uh... withdrew and

107
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,900
amazingly a year ago from ups dot stay
on the new s_e_c_ media consolidation

108
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,759
rules the f_c_c_ under michael powell
the sun of colin powell

109
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,060
decided that

110
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,580
the current laws that keep big
corporations from owning all of the

111
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,340
media the keeping of say

112
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,830
one station likelier channel from owning
all the t_v_ stations in all the radio

113
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,130
stations which are already pretty with
this

114
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,729
they decided they want to loosen them
even further

115
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,239
the reason why media consulting store a
lot of reasons why media consolidation

116
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:55,659
is a real concern one reason is like it
wasn't the radio uh... its really boring

117
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:01,419
right all you hear are the same
musicians and a corporation can like own

118
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,429
if u musicians and on the advertising
and control who gets hurt which make

119
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:09,800
most money and leads to boring content
bad content the other problem is just a

120
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,349
threat to democracy the lady a of a free
press is that we can hear different

121
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,649
voices and the five white men in suits
can decide the different viewpoints we

122
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:18,729
won't hear

123
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:23,550
that's like a fundamental threat to what
supposed to make our democracy stopped

124
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,620
so failures over so in any case uh...
year-ago previous gotta stay on the new

125
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,870
rules which did not come into play

126
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,309
and just recently s_e_c_ actually won
their case

127
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,740
which was and unbelievable victory
unbelievable

128
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,939
and the f_c_c_

129
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,120
is now forced to rewrite their rules and
justify them

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,840
and we'll talk about more about that
later

131
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,630
okay many say the first and meats dairy

132
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,279
stand

133
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,939
i get involved and ah...

134
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,689
doing marker and parity oh several years
ago uh... mostly

135
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,940
to support by radio um...

136
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,580
doing research and stations are getting
harassed

137
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,599
and uh... petri dish

138
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,769
said the eighteen eighty i remember what
you see do can you do stuff like that

139
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:07,190
for previous

140
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,949
and he said yes and didn't hear from an
end

141
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,630
and up in the catskills hanging out of
my kids and

142
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,830
allison this phone call comes and says
you know

143
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,089
can you break

144
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:18,150
can you look at these

145
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,939
twelve ownership studies at the i_c_c_
is put out of state and then write a

146
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:24,699
comment to the f_c_c_ in it

147
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,599
anesthetic liked it

148
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,810
and but one of the things that the
media's always does is you know we like

149
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,550
the little red hands we may not have the
skills to do it but we sell out were

150
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,499
willing

151
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:39,610
and then entered really counts most of
the time uh... is just you know selling

152
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,009
out the um...

153
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,229
if you believe in free speech in you
believe in south lake

154
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,729
you know maybe somebody else besides

155
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:49,279
these delays sit beside

156
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,050
what the quality of our communication
system it is

157
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,400
uh... then that means sometimes doing
something lake

158
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,729
seeing through reading economic studies
that where it

159
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,300
written by the f_c_c_ and and their
favorite that corporations

160
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,479
said and and and my little crime in the
cats cuz its my kids

161
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,929
i'm not an economist at any minute and a
college degree

162
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:16,119
and um... and sitting and and this
little

163
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,809
fighting you know reading to the study
is an and on the hog brought the

164
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:25,239
comments with katie that and gave us the
legal standing to be any on absent

165
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,989
uh...

166
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,100
lysate

167
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,060
and sell it you know i i hear out of
time from people i know i'm sadie two

168
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,050
that you know one of two people can make
a difference play

169
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,469
and we actually believe that that um...

170
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,740
and that we can sometimes all you have
to do a sellout uh... and and that can

171
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,520
build a

172
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,340
build something and bigger

173
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,510
and as it turned out at the gym anywhere
one of two and a half million people of

174
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,530
that one out

175
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,660
and writing

176
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,500
to the f_c_c_ and to their
congresspeople aren't complaining about

177
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,910
the ownership which is like one percent
of our population

178
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,410
and part of that is the summit these
guys

179
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,870
and at you know

180
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,220
at coming up with the idea displayed a
simple prospect

181
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,030
so that uh...

182
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,810
anybody they get access to the internet
could be easy rewrite comments uh...

183
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,850
you know that

184
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,070
again just you know why need one guy in
philly taking his his at his little

185
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,460
knowledge of prospecting and

186
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,140
turning it into something that was
incredibly powerful enable it said to

187
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,090
galvanize millions of people

188
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,100
i want to be heard

189
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,790
buffet falcon yes i am goes on and we
had we have other faiths that are

190
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,329
happening and dekhti

191
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,870
and united really really believe that
every

192
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,870
percent is uh...

193
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,650
uh... access a communication and culture
on civic participation that is

194
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,500
meaningful

195
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,130
and so here we see out the f_m_ as being
an accessible technology that's very

196
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,529
inexpensive it's easy to use

197
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,560
people understand that they would be one
of the involved in it

198
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,270
and and so we went to see it expanded
and right now there's a dell uh...

199
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,470
dead as to our planet

200
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:17,080
as to how fun at those two five oh five
s to find out that i'm so sorry

201
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,610
he can't ban and about edta media's
radio that work for you here where is

202
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,020
that acts to yet now

203
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,280
t expand it

204
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,900
take standing at my stations um...

205
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,990
breaks in the s_e_c_ and let them know
so that you care about this and that you

206
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,080
want to see

207
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,370
more people have more access to airwaves
and basically

208
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,900
you know and numbers

209
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,990
numbers count i mean you can make a
difference an

210
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,680
there's one thing that had developed a s
two five oh five

211
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,870
what s two five oh five is is it's a
bill that john mccain's office propose

212
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,660
which is

213
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,799
on the wonderful thing

214
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,189
which basically with there's a thing
called a thirty jason rel uh... which is

215
00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:07,920
this jesse helms rule which was allowed
a few low-power stations on the air

216
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,870
most of the most cities in most areas
they are not available to some lesser

217
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,010
yours area happens have very very few
stations

218
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,660
they say there's not enough room because
they claimed possible interference

219
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,079
there that ccs now dot technical study

220
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,580
which ship called the mitre report

221
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,950
which shows that actually there is no
interference it's actually fine there

222
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,010
could be

223
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,000
many many many more communications all
across the nation

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,940
and now

225
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,470
for once there is that they gave me an
opportunity to actually open up for the

226
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,870
airwaves to all the stations

227
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,240
and decisions that have already been
built or amazing and we'll talk about a

228
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,930
few them

229
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,480
uh... and so that's what's really really
important

230
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,439
for now that there's a spill on the
table

231
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:50,839
uh... that called on the caning caller
center there isn't any support lp f_m_

232
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,100
just a little bit more about this

233
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,910
a little bit more about these
frequencies being opened up so the

234
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,579
thirty jason rule says that a few of the
station nine ninety point one

235
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,560
then there can't be another station then
ninety point three

236
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,600
the first adjacent ninety point five or
ninety point seven thirty days

237
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,610
the technical rules for that's for opi
f_m_'s so if you have a translator

238
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,550
station which is just like a nokia fam
except that it's more power two hundred

239
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,030
fifty watts instead of ten or a hundred

240
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,939
and it doesn't originate any content
it's just taking an existing radio

241
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,950
station sending out the same stuff

242
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,770
you can help those in a second adjacent

243
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,579
the rules say that that doesn't cause
any interference but if you are the

244
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,270
exact same equipment

245
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,230
it's just the audio going into it is
coming from a mixing board instead of

246
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,920
from a radio receiver

247
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,650
then you can't have it there

248
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,480
so the rules are amin

249
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,090
if you follow what they're saying

250
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,100
there's no reason that you can have up
defense on the second adjacent

251
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,210
affective making this change to it being
thirty jason is that there are no spaces

252
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,450
for help if m stations in any of the top
one hundred radio markets in the u_s_

253
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,790
except in new orleans there's a spot for
one station

254
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,920
bag that's the nice and friend plane

255
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,070
uh... is that

256
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,750
with dave is talking about is when you
have to the translators and of course

257
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,320
and by debate preparations

258
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,240
and that's how clinton on does their
business and is very flexible and he

259
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,610
zeros for them to get translators

260
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,200
but the same technology is applied to a
communities at community is

261
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,130
it's very very restricted

262
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,120
and and that silly because

263
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,430
you know up till now there hasn't been
uh... issues uh...

264
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,360
alive sense and i'm their communications
infrastructure

265
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,110
out my people getting involved in saying
you know this is what we want a

266
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,550
communications intersection to look like

267
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,610
this is that we live

268
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:49,530
uh... unit have access that we want and
need

269
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,990
weeks uh... one of the things that we've
been looking at recently is uh...

270
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,450
the lifetime of man

271
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,840
and unlicensed specter manpower

272
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,940
the passivity and that

273
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,830
services there now provided by public
access television and i came by and

274
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,680
a low-power f_m_ serious make sunday

275
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,680
uh... the over uh...

276
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,340
wireless community networks and really
excited about and think about math

277
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,530
community networks and its products

278
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,920
demean reason they were excited about it
is as many of you wheeler hackers and

279
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,130
had experienced now uh...

280
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:36,290
dana is is our ministry has they can
charge their place sunday

281
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,680
so the face that you're seeing over
intellectual property digital rights

282
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,570
management

283
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,400
and trusted computing all those things
that my things they are looking to

284
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,090
replace sciences wireless networks

285
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,370
you know we'd work against

286
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,000
dev business model that has existed for
a hundred years around radio and

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,450
television is

288
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:01,000
captive audiences providing money from
captive advertisers

289
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,910
and and we sat

290
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,180
through the lp f_m_ fight uh...

291
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,850
we set the date back estes come the
congress with manufactured evidence

292
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,110
buying

293
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,490
uh... medium

294
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,460
just bowled allright

295
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,690
confusing lying and and

296
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,320
uh... untruths

297
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,489
the uh... during

298
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:22,210
the last set of hearings

299
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,890
for the uh... introduction of these
thirty jasoncroft when things that they

300
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,420
presented to congress was just was a cd
of examples of what interference with

301
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,630
sounds like if you had a prodigious
inspection

302
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,880
and the cv was made by taking to audio
samples and playing them at the same

303
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,720
time over each other

304
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,300
and celery expect a lead that

305
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,220
that that expands saddened

306
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,410
that the bright essays f_a_a_ than a
couple of people and in a bag planes on

307
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,170
straight out and talking about the takes
picnic

308
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,560
wading into and allied you know against

309
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,550
ubiquitous computing and pervasive
connectivity and wear those contacts

310
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,530
uh... i don't think they're going to be
very happy about that

311
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,530
so

312
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,370
or and the future uh...

313
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,989
witness this morning possibility you
know that that is so

314
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:15,690
celebrate insect stating that

315
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,970
i have the ability for communi
communities

316
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,820
too

317
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,390
all running control their own
communications infrastructure

318
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,750
uh... is a very

319
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:33,030
very close to the hearts of people until
out yeah fam uh... we like the idea

320
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,360
uh...

321
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,089
self provisioning models of
communication

322
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:37,860
incentive

323
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,140
uh... controlled and restricted

324
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,109
caught while communication and extended
their accent at the technology

325
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,000
could potentially ballet

326
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,620
uh... but the arabs have

327
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,440
looking at the political clutching a
rehab and and the economic ah... concept

328
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,870
that is the only gonna happen at this
area of movement uh... that is that

329
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,510
combines people with technical skills

330
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,840
and to create those platforms keep them
hope and

331
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,730
and we need you know proactive back

332
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,170
proactive policy and practice and

333
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,920
technology

334
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,969
to make it happen

335
00:17:12,969 --> 00:17:19,969
and corrected economics

336
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:25,209
sega i think a lot about the converter

337
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,670
but the banking some

338
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,250
so uh... theirs

339
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,830
two things that um...

340
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,659
or talk about uh... one they are not
ready for the the visa radio barn

341
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:38,010
raising super meteors holds because the
really exciting

342
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,570
uh... and they're wonderful model for
bring technology itself resource for

343
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,439
communities

344
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,110
and then later what wall so that when
talk about some the technical projects

345
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,480
that for me this has been working on
people being involved with and there's

346
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,350
generally exciting uh...

347
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,790
so the barn raising cdi at the barn
raising is basically

348
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,309
that um... desert communities that if a
barn falls down

349
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:04,049
the whole community comes together and
builds the bar right through the weekend

350
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:08,190
you know were weak ever communicated
together they can build spon and their

351
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,490
families who had the bar knocked down by
themselves couldn't do it wouldn't have

352
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,540
the resources

353
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,020
so the idea is you know there's a
community need and we can come together

354
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,129
and philip

355
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,710
we should do it

356
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,950
the idea of the radio barn raising visit
me this is working with communities

357
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,010
do reviews although power f_m_ station
community radio station

358
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,259
but they're not radio engineers

359
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:34,399
they've never run the station before so
the question is how do we make it

360
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:38,599
possible uh... in the barn raising is a
wonderful model for about a reason to

361
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,810
come

362
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,320
opus although that is what the barn
raising its

363
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,600
what happens is that all sorts of people

364
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,070
go to account for weekend and we have a
conference kinda like this in their

365
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,189
workshops in

366
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,190
we teach shit about you know

367
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,580
be radio engineer had to be a d_j_ had
two interviews

368
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,218
but in the background

369
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,659
people are all working together to
actually build the station by which we

370
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:00,380
mean

371
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,810
put up the antenna

372
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,250
set up the transmitter

373
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,730
actually build the studio

374
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,590
there's to by raising the so that um...
are good examples just as a group cirque

375
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,030
siting in the barn raising sav

376
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,220
stories about them the kind of
illustrate the field of our ratings

377
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,730
um... which are really like
life-changing inspiring events i mean

378
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,080
helped me to talk about in such strong
terms would be really are

379
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,510
wonderful a really wonderful things

380
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,169
oak of the most recent by raising uh...

381
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,870
i've been to was for the uh... collision
of a mock we workers

382
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,320
in a mockery florida

383
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,490
uh... the collision of a mapi workers

384
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,100
uh... advocates for tomato pickers in
florida

385
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,150
these are people that don't perceive a
living wage at all uh... and they live

386
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,240
in these communities where brent serving
so randomly high and prices are

387
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,190
exorbitant lehigh

388
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,940
and most number are don't live in the
country legally

389
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,870
the conditions it's not it's not seeing
too much to say this basically like a

390
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,840
slavery condition

391
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,918
recently in national geographic they did
a did

392
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,260
the reports on for modern day slavery

393
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,190
andy maki workers were featured

394
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,809
so what what happened is we

395
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,799
although a bunch of people like people
like us in this room some radio

396
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,850
engineers

397
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,610
to some people been involved with the
past

398
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,769
all went down for a weekend and built
the coalition of monthly workers a

399
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:24,000
station though it's not really correct
to say that we build it because the idea

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,419
of a barn raising

401
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:30,370
that if you know how to do something you
shouldn't actually do it

402
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,600
right that the idea

403
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,120
now normally in our society gauges will
experts defects right but something is

404
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,899
technical it's sort of scary mystical

405
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:43,419
and so unless you have sort of a
appointed uh... role to be able to do it

406
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:44,540
you shouldn't do it

407
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,760
but we all know you know people who

408
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,680
are hackers are people who aren't afraid
to take things partner figure out how

409
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,450
things work know that actually a lot of
things are manageable if you work with

410
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,700
people or if you take the time

411
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,390
into media the barn raising

412
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,790
is that you know you work with someone
you know you if you wanna learn how to

413
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,100
solder you watch someone do it first

414
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,679
and then you do it with someone

415
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,550
and then you do yourself

416
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,090
and teach somebody else had to do it

417
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,230
said did not

418
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,490
say monthly workers have have a board
that's been cited by five women who

419
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,390
never thought of before

420
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,330
and that's the point that is right and
it's the same now

421
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,929
that these skills span is the key

422
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,100
i guess where gary eight yy

423
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,450
not going to come in and the experience
a

424
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,720
unexpected let me at that

425
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,809
soldering iron you know you today

426
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:35,879
takes and that is that it's a head yet
decided the fire

427
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,840
and they say no i've never done and i
like

428
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,439
let's go started as a black

429
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,960
here's how you doing and then and i'd
say they do and that person's got it

430
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,059
down

431
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,908
you don't go in and family t somebody
has to say and what it is so sad to sell

432
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:52,340
sell and sell had to do this you looks
interesting

433
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,919
and you walk away

434
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,740
and then set that's the by may seem odd
odd and that we think it can be applied

435
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,909
to lot and i i tech not technical
community projects

436
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:04,360
treatment favorite example to illustrate
this

437
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,820
is in the station in a monthly florida
uh...

438
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,658
you know there's an antenna there's a
transmitter the salon cable connecting

439
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:10,410
the two

440
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,750
which in this case was half-inch healy
accident armored cable

441
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,070
for the odor shielded instead of being
paraded like a normal t_v_ collective

442
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,070
something is actually a couple pipe

443
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,620
and the and the connectors that you put
in the end of this cost like sixty to

444
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,020
eighty dollars teach their easy to screw
up

445
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,280
and we had three professional radio
engineers there and we sort of showed it

446
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,570
to all of them all of them looked at it
and said i'm not going to do that get

447
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,120
somebody else to

448
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,720
thereof really scared to work with the
sex so what we did is we found a couple

449
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,530
people who are app visiting from a state
apparent station in nicaragua would

450
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,940
never saturday anything before

451
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,400
we sat down

452
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,730
yard and work with them for about two
hours we got the first and

453
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,170
the first connector pedantic comes with
in a little box with an illustrated

454
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:56,660
twenty step manual with the photo each
step of the process

455
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,080
very specialist told

456
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,220
did the first one but two hours um...
than i went often did something else

457
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,770
they did the second one about four hours

458
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,760
i think they did the last one about half
an hour they're better at it by the end

459
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,530
of it than you know anyone else there

460
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,020
just goes to show that even with these
very technical specialist kind of skills

461
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,960
if you have somebody was going to work
at it

462
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,110
you take a little time to show them how
to do it

463
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,690
they took a lot more away from that than
they would have had i set my room by

464
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:26,870
myself in this but the ends on the table
and brought the cable out for them later

465
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,450
says and i did send pat

466
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,160
apartments has worked on the story on

467
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,190
about the station we built in the uh...
in offices florida uh... sort of the

468
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,160
fans like across like for the feeling of
being a barn raising in michael i think

469
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,219
a lot of people do you really enjoy it
because

470
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:47,529
were not experts right are not
professional radio engineer

471
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:50,659
but you get the bill with him learn how
to do things in

472
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,799
learn together with the people that
you're working with

473
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,300
to make it happen

474
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,220
so the sudden the southern development
foundation is was the first civil rights

475
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,049
organization in the country that on its
own radio station

476
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:05,110
uh... and they're not with us for the
not too far from norman's

477
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,840
so we we're setting up their station
um...

478
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,629
and

479
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:10,600
you know the first time

480
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,150
you know that we're having some problems
like there's a problem of the dummy word

481
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,960
which is um... the

482
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,149
you when you turn on the radio
transmitter

483
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:20,530
i'm your neck of a dummy lid on it meant
henna

484
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,540
so that the power doesn't search back
from the transmitter and blow up the

485
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,450
transmitter

486
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,629
on this is a really serious problem

487
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:30,360
uh... and actually coming recover
leaders is a really serious problem for

488
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,330
pirate stations

489
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,710
and that we can either do is to move at
this and ah...

490
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,620
transmitters par equipment dont sell for
people to use used in people get it

491
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,799
myself in turn on your block

492
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,330
uh... and then they there's no radio
shack for

493
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,919
five hundred miles thousand-mile
standoff now so

494
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,030
visitors republican

495
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:55,129
adecco soundly down leader is that solve
that problem but over there

496
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,400
uh... they case

497
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,770
there were some problems really confused

498
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:01,750
everything seemed like this find it
seemed like we blown out our are

499
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,590
transmitter

500
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,720
we tested things and tested things in
all the professional engineers were

501
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,179
testing things

502
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,270
we've looked at your looking to put
minute says something seemed fine did

503
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,830
something seen messed up uh... in a case
on of what we said later but it was a

504
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,620
chief engineer was johnnie walker

505
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,850
it later that evening

506
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,710
uh... after drinking uh... a good bit of
a bottle of whiskey uh... dave really

507
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,400
partners

508
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,100
uh... the actually we have said it
before one oh seven three instead of one

509
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,670
oh three seven and even though we
protested that it has to be with us all

510
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,530
the members all the members on the
number

511
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,120
unknowingly televised it

512
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,420
out of these things reset the frequency
of little

513
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,480
dip switches that are inside a board
that you can barely see that's reaching

514
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,800
with a screwdriver

515
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,529
and do what can you see a one you see a
degree you see a seven and must be right

516
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:52,210
about ten people looked at it in
satisfied

517
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:58,780
it was a short between the earphones as
i think that

518
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,309
want when i think i can talk about this
because this whole attitude of

519
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:06,190
teaching other peoples of the like
demonstrating your like accurately this

520
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,350
over other people

521
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,539
is something that you know

522
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:12,908
it's like part of our culture is uh...
sort of like people ought to be dominant

523
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:15,879
with their information still burning of
the key to each other and so that one up

524
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:18,150
each other's aka real challenge

525
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,390
i thought that this is the case story
was kinda funny in that context about

526
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,150
like listens to do

527
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,659
yet this was and

528
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,830
down in cancun before the w_t_o_ meeting
their uh... there were some people

529
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,360
working on various radio projects and

530
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,370
we went through the whole weekend we
bill

531
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,269
a bunch of antennas decided to gather at
copper pipe uh... which i think for a

532
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:40,630
long time were hidden in a flower box
while people thought the cops were come

533
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,269
into the building anyway

534
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,890
when it came time to put these antennas
actually up

535
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:49,100
uh... there is a swollen kate was there
for zipping from london

536
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,880
really great and should learn

537
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,970
basically everything while she was there
new

538
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,320
uh... chino which is doing to you

539
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,200
and the strength of sort of oversee
putting up the antenna

540
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,190
one of the things that she kept
reiterated everyone was it has to be you

541
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,539
know a certain amount away from anything
that's metal it needs to be like mounted

542
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:10,360
on a would-be mike up in the air
somewhere

543
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,279
uh... ano you know way from anything
else

544
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,320
and everyone it's been so yeah yeah
that's great you know

545
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,879
uh... whatever

546
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,650
they went off the while she was gone
some one day they went in mona de

547
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,450
entrada

548
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,950
and it turned out that when she came
back inside this actually folded it

549
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,480
sideways off the top of another and

550
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,620
on the tower

551
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,760
uh... was really pretty impressive it's
like the worst possible thank you for

552
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,580
that

553
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,340
so that's been a problem that we've been
fighting with the irs you know even once

554
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,890
we teach people the skills they go back
and they're working with other people

555
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,919
who say well

556
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:47,850
you know you don't know what you're
talking about um...

557
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,840
and so that's something that we struggle
weapon that they struggle

558
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,740
does one last thing i thought that the
bunny things it is a lump

559
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,260
one is really wonderful about the barn
raising citizens that radio ends up even

560
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,029
though it's a good simple technology

561
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:03,639
you know when we go used it and

562
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:06,889
you know what it's big in other parts of
the world here in america people's into

563
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:09,340
their cars in this new it somewhat

564
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,500
uh... his idea of appropriate technology
which is a new kind of like salt a

565
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,000
problem for community and its often
really tempting especially if you're

566
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,640
kinda like technologically minded the
fine like the newest technology the

567
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,549
coolest technology the technology you'd
like to learn about

568
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:28,429
in use at technology trying fix the
problem reality situation is if you go

569
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:32,289
into a community and you build something
that's cool but they can actually

570
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:34,309
maintain themselves

571
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,960
it's lots of candy worse than useless
for the american people the spontaneity

572
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,940
hoping the project

573
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,750
but yet it's not really been worker out
for them oven is a really cool story

574
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,559
them trying to track down the details of

575
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,980
that uh... java man

576
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,529
who's in there and back waiting uh...
told uh...

577
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,310
about basically uh...

578
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:55,360
teams used to go down to accounted
somewhere in the global south like

579
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,280
we on the details

580
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,860
and we build bridges would build a
bridge for them

581
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,510
and they would use metal that you sort
of modern bridge building techniques

582
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,350
but the the bridge area with the police
like every year

583
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,630
and the bridge would literally get
destroyed like or be severely damaged

584
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,059
every year

585
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:12,970
and they couldn't make in the village
there couldn't maintain it

586
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,130
resort and saly people went down there
in built a bridge using wood in using

587
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:17,920
bar

588
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,880
and it's not new bridge building
technology but technology that they

589
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,470
could work with the naked use

590
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,570
and so is actually useful and it was

591
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,200
you know we're gonna pass along this
technology

592
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,269
not just you know use it ourselves and
give its innocence or guilt

593
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:34,490
does not really get it all so

594
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,080
the challenge over time that you know
figure out for example maybe they could

595
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,439
wifi you're not works right we'd love to
maybe do like a wireless network barn

596
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,950
raising but the question is how do we
can't make that technology into an

597
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,460
appropriate technology well kind of
problems can it really solved

598
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,610
in his ear ready you know

599
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:58,490
insanity did that pass intact challenges
and anybody can step up

600
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:03,919
an see exactly where they tell your
friends that about some similac at

601
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,780
our problem selling played by a problem

602
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,970
and then i think that same protest and
so

603
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,429
when we are here at future kato uh...
we've talked about our studio

604
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:13,930
transmitter like project

605
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,260
and when the very exciting things about
that is wonder from so we are having

606
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,540
weight silence detection we needed to
know when uh... the link was down when

607
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,769
kuwait was just silence going over it
not natural signal

608
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:28,380
uh... the f_c_c_ has a silly religion
shin broadcast more than like thirty

609
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,890
seconds of silence

610
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,320
so somebody actually solve this problem
for us which is possum

611
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,370
we can have to do it

612
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,649
uh... and came up with a circuit and

613
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:41,230
has this nice little thing that we can
build look like

614
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,430
uh... walker to support the parts and it
works great

615
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,920
and so we're hoping that with some of
these other problems

616
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,400
you know by the time of the next hope
conference one of you will come up with

617
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,100
a solution for us

618
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,460
uh... the first problem is this uh...

619
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,629
fallback circuit so the problem is if
you turn on a radio transmitter that's

620
00:30:57,629 --> 00:31:00,980
not hooked up to any kind of resistor
antenna or something

621
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,020
it'll burn out the uh... output
transistor election meltdown

622
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,150
uh... so we want is a circuit that will
detect whether there's an antenna detect

623
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:09,950
attached

624
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,190
and turn off the transmitter as the case

625
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,429
just to ask of you are fullback circuits
with the usually called

626
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:19,460
they're built in the most commercial
transmitters but they're expensive

627
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,420
we want something we can build for like
ten bucks other parts from radio shack

628
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:23,940
kirk

629
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,670
digi-key or something

630
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:35,549
let's talk afterwards

631
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:40,129
yet he kicked

632
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,669
catalyst up up down

633
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:47,659
no actually we set up the sounds last
year youporn com melody instrument what

634
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:50,860
mark before your what city

635
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,210
the challenge will be like working with
us tax in it to help us make something

636
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:58,590
actually works right

637
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,340
but that together you know probabilistic
did bang it out and that would actually

638
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,090
be like tremendously valuable like
tremendously valuable

639
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,460
uh... italy's examples were like a
little technical solution the will work

640
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:17,320
hugo a tremendously long way especially
we share their knowledge

641
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,129
another sort of more complicated
challenges right now when we build up a

642
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,950
small station microporous station we
usually go when we buy a radio

643
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,870
transmitter cat from someplace you
planning to assist you different

644
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,400
companies would buy them from

645
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,420
and we'll take it down there at the
circuit board obvious some on the symbol

646
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,110
personal soccer together

647
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,660
and they come with depending on the
ground they have better or worse manuals

648
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:43,010
uh... better worse documentation and
last shorter longer amount of time

649
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,309
what we would really love to have sort
of along the lines of the open course

650
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:48,930
project is and open hardware design

651
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,780
for like a one one transmitter

652
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,360
that'll meter exceed

653
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,560
whatever relevant regulations are

654
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,840
and that can be built cheaply where we
can have a circuit board design

655
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,960
semantics troubleshooting manual

656
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,820
everything

657
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,860
that we can give alan will become unit
the standard transmitter for my

658
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,510
propeller stations

659
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,860
arms of anybody's interested in working
on a project like that we'd love to get

660
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,760
together a team of people and

661
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,120
yeah start packing up

662
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,480
uh... uh... another project that we talk
about two years ago and uh...

663
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,290
uh... at the class of conference

664
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,899
is um a software project called below

665
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,929
one challenge of his getting audio from
a studio to a transmitter if this to you

666
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:32,359
in transmitter are different locations

667
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,769
one reason this is really really
important for community stations

668
00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:37,890
is because of the ridiculous

669
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:43,290
f_c_c_ rules on the power often you know
you want este shin in your city but

670
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:47,010
because the rules you could only have a
transmitter ten miles away so actually

671
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,470
for example uh... in in maryland there
is a station

672
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,940
will be able to get a license ten miles
away on an island

673
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,970
bumps uh... so for them to get their
signal ten miles across the base of the

674
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,940
signal to be sent back across the bay
reacts with the weekend rebuilding

675
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,100
internet solutions

676
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,290
using all open-source technology still
to be shared it so amusing the

677
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,389
the audio signal

678
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,969
on at the studio we're going to an xbox
encoded using sort of standard web

679
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,299
screening technology

680
00:34:16,299 --> 00:34:18,549
sent uh... over the internet the
california

681
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:23,310
where percent into space recibi beamed
down through the satellite internet

682
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:27,440
through the transmitter is very very
proud to be period is in the body single

683
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,210
into space so that the f_c_c_ would
allow it to be transmitted ten miles

684
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,418
across the world community

685
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:38,609
of problems with the other pulled the
appropriate technology issue here though

686
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,498
because you know we had this promise all
get audio from one place to another

687
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:45,389
summit that's great we use open-source
tools

688
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,189
this is in the heart of a problem

689
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:50,708
in practice all problems are much harder
than you think they are you know it's

690
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:54,109
easy to do a little bit but have to be
reliable spots harder

691
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:56,418
book the thing that has never been done

692
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:59,730
is really package it up in a way hit
someone

693
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,549
who you know doesn't know how the title
an xbox can actually use

694
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:07,839
and so but wonderful project would be
for example if someone

695
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,629
there was someone with some sysadmin
skills no folded in this new couple perl

696
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:13,618
scripts in a couple applications

697
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:15,629
in to say something like nofx acts like
a

698
00:35:15,629 --> 00:35:17,680
cdv bootable lynn x

699
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,450
uh... into the plastic and out the
before

700
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,759
the cd one for the studio month for the
transmitter they plug it into two

701
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:28,729
computers and wallach they have a cheap
steel transmitter lack

702
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:31,939
and and every one of a project that
won't work for anyone who's interested

703
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:33,538
in doing that uh...

704
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:37,910
an internet like you know it's not an
ideal solution because italy's reliable

705
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,199
as the internet

706
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:42,060
but for station that has no other
options

707
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,770
it can be no meat meat make the
difference between being able to have a

708
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,049
station and not have a station

709
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:51,660
of the microwave links which you can get
we just came on mike with anita randy

710
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,868
want to see if you want to try it one at
that point the transmitter thermo

711
00:35:54,869 --> 00:36:00,540
reliable but in fresno for example there
wasn't company frequency available

712
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,319
and sometimes is not possible along

713
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:05,109
the traditional way to the station would
do this would be to spend about ten

714
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:06,839
thousand dollars on the problem

715
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,930
have my correct our on each end a
four-foot gash

716
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,890
you know you've got beat the dedicated
trump spectrum that you can use to send

717
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,499
the signal to your transmitter

718
00:36:16,499 --> 00:36:19,979
uh... problems that we've run into
trying to use this other places like the

719
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:23,380
station in maryland uh... where the
studios on one side the chesapeake the

720
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,219
transmitter was on the other is we
actually thought about putting you know

721
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:30,289
wifi on a tower on both sides of the
shooting at ten miles across the bay you

722
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:33,119
know maybe fog would be a problem

723
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,849
when the big problems is that this large
container ships that come through and

724
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:39,759
the control tower those tall enough to
go over the tops the chaps

725
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:42,979
another problem that happens with using
my career point point makes is that a

726
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:46,619
lot of time to discuss and frequency
available uh... using wi-fi which was

727
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:50,319
not able to get that kind of quality of
service reliability that we need for

728
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:51,459
radio station

729
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,578
young we need to be down from the more
than thirty seconds of the time and

730
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:59,229
preferably in about twenty years
contract

731
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:03,150
not able to get anywhere close to that
using off the shelf life rocks

732
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,859
set that brings me back himself
retaining too

733
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,538
in supply and i my sense because

734
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:15,409
white banks is the beginning of what's
possible with

735
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:19,149
when you combine computers with
networking

736
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:20,578
radio

737
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,479
transmitting last night

738
00:37:22,479 --> 00:37:25,099
when i see radio that sending in this
case

739
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:30,129
so i i i think their first taste uh...
that the public as being able to have of

740
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:32,259
like they cost my radio

741
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:34,299
networking and gears and

742
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:36,769
by its transmission

743
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:40,199
these technologies that have been around
for quite a while some of them as long

744
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,989
as fifty years

745
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:45,299
uh... and to give you one and example of

746
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:50,279
well we rap against wealthy f_m_ is
available you know any a couple of

747
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:53,679
hundred places around the country

748
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,239
think about cell phones and

749
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,139
went south on fifty years ago

750
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:03,789
the a mad the airwaves they were taken
out by one conversation now

751
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:07,500
a hundred thousand channels of
communication are available

752
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,099
and that same amout their space

753
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:15,729
i was a little what we are wondering you
know it's not always the public scott

754
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:20,679
you know i think in india but they have
that handout

755
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:22,859
expansion and communication

756
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:27,519
possibilities available at the community
level and had a repeat that okay

757
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,039
and one of the things

758
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:30,979
that ties into the ownership

759
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:35,380
studies what was going on back back at
the f_c_c_ anionic six cities is the the

760
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,579
f_c_c_ has created another barrier for
the public

761
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,739
another precedent fear

762
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:44,449
because the f_c_c_ says

763
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:48,069
whatever rose a past have to be based on
and

764
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:52,349
plant pots acts they have to be based on
facts

765
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:54,029
cell adn

766
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:56,220
so we have zero i'd be generated

767
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,020
you know studies and all kinds of stuff
to be proving

768
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:05,319
that you know the public has is capable
on a ball and and desires

769
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:07,489
to use these technologies

770
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:13,339
so anything to do is uh... generates
some studies over this summer

771
00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:15,369
uh... selling

772
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:20,129
the s_e_c_ said expand on my since
eighty l uh... by going out and just

773
00:39:20,129 --> 00:39:25,229
taking spectrum analyzers and and and
just messing an ensign there's

774
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,459
availability on the television

775
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:29,058
antennas

776
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:33,319
okay and the television bad because they
there's big time

777
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:37,609
busy rolling coming up in september and
we can comment uh... when people go out

778
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,519
and tests and say hey look good

779
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,349
there's nothing

780
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:47,099
and means television band-like and we
use it by unlicensed

781
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:48,569
wifi

782
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:51,459
and then the problems that

783
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:55,428
they cave is talking about a stuff
because you have a bad air uh... better

784
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:58,940
quality tenderness and emedtv then then
you have

785
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,939
uh... with what's currently available
for a while back

786
00:40:01,939 --> 00:40:06,729
so that that's when x one mile long
explanation of aline the friday said

787
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:07,789
like people in town

788
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:08,920
jump into

789
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,370
so again this project is we want to make
a map of the u_s_ shows where these t_v_

790
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,719
bands that are off to beat the allocated

791
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:18,930
where those are empty and were therefore
and our bed is that it's going to be

792
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,009
tough week color teach

793
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:25,759
where it's not empty maps to be almost
entirely white

794
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:28,849
channels argues very many places
throughout the country

795
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:31,459
but what we need ur data points for that

796
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:35,578
map which are going to be people who go
out and take a scanner or you know if

797
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,239
you're a ham radio person and you have
some way of receiving on these

798
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:41,399
frequencies goin measure and see how
much

799
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:45,029
signal is there that at those places

800
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:50,849
animated enemy if that's ok akram thank
essen and friend and help establish till

801
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,209
sandy king

802
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:55,348
can have have a participatory way

803
00:40:55,349 --> 00:40:58,589
their interest in developing a
participatory research my doesn't like

804
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,649
the communications theory that the
environmental movement has used like

805
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:03,189
bucket brigades

806
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:06,629
take incentives and chain people to do
of

807
00:41:06,629 --> 00:41:11,709
to do at their own mazya mangan bonds
and and the science affects their lives

808
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:14,560
so interested in trying to bring those
paintings and

809
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,820
kellee davis i think that is is is
actually going with the spectrum

810
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,469
analyzer and messing

811
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:23,369
and people have that ability another
thing is that there's just database is

812
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:24,399
out there

813
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:28,220
that if you want it you know if you've
got lots lots of money and you want it

814
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,789
you decide you want to have a t_v_
station you can buy i'm software

815
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:36,280
packages that are so you know the
terrain of ways to move your towel and

816
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,679
elect a step

817
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:40,430
and sell people could also you had uh...

818
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,249
the ability to do data analysis in
rampant datasets

819
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:48,199
that's another way of of doing and i'd
like to see both things happen uh...

820
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:54,989
before september first so we really can
set the public's interest and yet

821
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:58,190
discipline another area problems that
come

822
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,459
for certain technical challenges

823
00:42:00,459 --> 00:42:05,669
looked like all the amazing things that
previous has done in can-do with serves

824
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:09,949
simple web tools and programming time
it's really worth stressing that

825
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:13,510
non but uh... fellow kevin in
philadelphia wrote a script

826
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,010
that would take comments

827
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:18,559
and then for malcolm appropriately so
that they could be submitted this formal

828
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,010
f_c_c_ comments and over seven hundred
thousand comments were submitted to the

829
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,359
f_c_c_

830
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,279
change the political debate and that the
issue of media consolidation for a lot

831
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:32,449
of reasons finally hit the big time at
least for a brief moment

832
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,670
their other kinds of like web chick
flick

833
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:37,629
projects that are ongoing use help

834
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:41,879
there's been a uh... a database of
community radio allies have different

835
00:42:41,879 --> 00:42:45,339
groups working on this issue uh... be
able to share which has been really

836
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:46,949
exciting

837
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:50,819
i think the people working with uh...
previously been for involved inserted

838
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:55,799
independent media online um... issues
are for example there's indymedia like

839
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:57,249
indymedia dot organ

840
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:59,909
those are groups in different cities

841
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:03,140
of coke for a lot of cities because the
poor thing that they used

842
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,910
is to sort of simple web based

843
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,390
technology may be written in p_h_p_ or
perot which allow people to publish

844
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:14,029
their own articles published their own
audio published third video and really

845
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:15,970
be the media and the way that uh...

846
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,489
you know the t-shirts are talking about

847
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:21,199
you know the ideas that you know all of
us we journalists and all of us can

848
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,339
spread media and through the service

849
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:27,038

was punished for giving fire to humanity
which is neither of the metaphor for all

882
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:18,679
of us trying to take the technological
multi no and spread out fire spread the

many questions

885
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:27,509

appreciate if you come up and use the

886
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:31,549

uh... i'd like to say that like

905
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:29,589
your watching previous companies upon

these hearings in different cities where
people can talk about

909
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:42,630
why localism is important to them were

00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:39,839
violate any teams that

928
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:44,499
but it's a question was how difficult is
it to start a community radio station in

929
00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:46,209
your area

930
00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:50,259
real quickly i think the processes for
stuff you can go on the f_c_c_'s website

931
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:53,589
next we have some pretty cool little web
tools that you can use to find out what

932
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:55,509
frequencies might be available

933
00:47:55,509 --> 00:48:00,239
and then there are no fees to apply for
a low-power f_m_ license um... any

934
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:06,109
non-profit community group can apply and
many of those groups are an individual

935
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:09,558
so it's not hard to apply for it it
costs if you know a few thousand dollars

936
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,329
in equipment to set it up

937
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:15,209
the hardest part of the whole process is
finding a community to work with you cuz

938
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:18,029
you're not going to be the only detect

939
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:20,550
finding some kind of organization or
them

940
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:27,550
no proof that you can work with on this

941
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:32,439
and the follow up with how much does it
cost a month to run one

942
00:48:32,439 --> 00:48:36,149
um... once you have the equipment you
know rent

943
00:48:36,149 --> 00:48:39,029
you're paying for your tower space if
you have your entire commercial power

944
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:46,029
it's not a whole lot of money

945
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,269
what if you take an online support

946
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:55,079
i mean completely online

947
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,220
officially thump

948
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,169
from u_p_s_ is

949
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:01,140
is not involved in any unlicensed
broadcast

950
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,150
uh... because it's the best thing for
the ticket because of its buyer roots

951
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,700
well in the u_s_ uh... yet uh... in
other countries previous is involved

952
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,889
with our broadcasting

953
00:49:08,889 --> 00:49:12,519
personally and number of people who work
with news the volunteer

954
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:16,329
i'm really excited about it and i'm
excited about some of these tools like

955
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,569
broadcasting content on the internet

956
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:19,900
to unlicensed

957
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,750
broadcast

958
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,780
because he proposes new model where
uh... no the content providers separated

959
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,329
from the actual transmitter it to me
that's a

960
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:30,160
there

961
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,720
dissent in the future we'd like to see
and i think they fit

962
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,719
by frank and things like that we'd like
to see

963
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,049
the expansion of our license to take
away licenses which were in the future

964
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:42,650
would you like to see at last

965
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,420
licensing

966
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,409
unless constricted

967
00:49:48,409 --> 00:49:50,089
defeated yet you know

968
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:54,440
way and immediately delete it nineties
day we don't have access to delineate

969
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,390
the communities that we work with

970
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:58,078
at this point

971
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,000
but i think that uh... introduced these
reduced from

972
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,920
one of the founders of the thank you for
your project and you guys are left by

973
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,640
the the peacock

974
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,569
i think

975
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:15,929
uh... these community radio stations
that that's the same censorship liza

976
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,759
role that the other insist the
subjective

977
00:50:19,759 --> 00:50:22,889
out they are

978
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,829
but the truth the matter is the

979
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:28,179
one of the better things about f_c_c_
policy is that they say very little

980
00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:32,609
about what you can say on a radio
station except for in the paula enough

981
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:34,949
realm of indecency in obscenity

982
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:39,149
and uh... those rules are are ridiculous
and and they almost always get thrown

983
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:42,199
out by the courts as they go through the
system anyway

984
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:46,359
we don't focus a lot on that because the
vast majority of stations

985
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:50,419
uh... break those rules all the time and
nothing ever happened to them

986
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:55,319
our main focus is getting access to for
as many communities as possible for as

987
00:50:55,319 --> 00:51:02,319
many offers made by local organizations
we possibly can

988
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:05,989
one last question um... are you aware of
them

989
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:07,459
the current name

990
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:11,919
recent past in miami there's a huge
problem with higher radio stations

991
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:15,538
uh... and then the s_e_c_'s pushing for

992
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,529
instead of just finds jail time

993
00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:22,699
uh... anywhere from three to five years
in jail

994
00:51:22,699 --> 00:51:24,439
broadcasting illegal

995
00:51:24,439 --> 00:51:25,660
for schools

996
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,509
for second place

997
00:51:27,509 --> 00:51:30,839
yeah and the worst thing that's
happening there is that actually not the

998
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:32,558
f_c_c_ but the state

999
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,279
has tacitly boston's wishing with it

1000
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:39,379
you have received this and i think that
uh... it's a really

1001
00:51:39,379 --> 00:51:43,959
battling for for states to start getting
involved in doing a second level level

1002
00:51:43,959 --> 00:51:47,409
of regulation uh... broadcasting

1003
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:50,879
it makes sense that the federal
government if any has been a regulate

1004
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:52,239
broadcasting

1005
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:55,439
it should be the federal government
because radio signals don't

1006
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:58,519
respect boundaries

1007
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:03,269
when the state government gets into into
the picture by padding his own staff of

1008
00:52:03,269 --> 00:52:06,789
fines and penalties that's totally
ridiculous i don't think that's going to

1009
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,699
be sustained by the courts either

1010
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:13,009
uh... whatever shreds there are left of
separation of powers and separation of

1011
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:17,069
jurisdictions bought in this country act
i hope that all that stuff gets stuck

1012
00:52:17,069 --> 00:52:24,069
down and i can't be too well

1013
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:29,989
oh is there

1014
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:30,929
the last one

1015
00:52:30,929 --> 00:52:33,689
desperate

1016
00:52:33,689 --> 00:52:37,509
is there some place that publishes a
list of frequencies owned by these big

1017
00:52:37,509 --> 00:52:39,409
corporations like where general

1018
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:43,049
as we went to a problem and uh... south
jersey

1019
00:52:43,049 --> 00:52:46,909
on the employee buyout right here
healthy f_m_ startup we submitted a

1020
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:50,959
bunch of survey cfcc no nothing's
available and then within a year

1021
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,919
clearchannel fourteen stations in here

1022
00:52:53,919 --> 00:52:57,658
uh... we were going reserve deserve was
somewhere po what these corporations

1023
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:00,489
acting on

1024
00:53:00,489 --> 00:53:03,179
and and delete this center for public
integrity

1025
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:06,709
has that i've dated a space add buddy

1026
00:53:06,709 --> 00:53:12,249
output yday and finally made a mistake
by a friend at the time

1027
00:53:12,249 --> 00:53:14,979
at its best cc's to elect

1028
00:53:14,979 --> 00:53:18,740
uh... the f_c_c_ others although it's
much more obscurity user

1029
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,819
uh... per cent of public and integrity
is a better path

1030
00:53:22,819 --> 00:53:26,469
uh... subtracted finding finding by
corporations

1031
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,729
and so on

1032
00:53:27,729 --> 00:53:31,469
uh... you just look them up on the web
center for public integrity

1033
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:33,989
uh... and and they'll be really helpful

1034
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:38,599
uh... i'm so sorry that i mean you're so
late but uh... we have a whole bunch of

1035
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:43,259
of literature that i just brought my
bags gonna get splattered across

1036
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:45,669
local server service right up there

1037
00:53:45,669 --> 00:53:48,720
also mail unless if you wanna get deeper
involvement

1038
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,130
for me he is ready to project come out
to our fundraising to help build the

1039
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,079
stations help build wireless networks in
