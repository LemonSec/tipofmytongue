1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:09,600
that works

2
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,449
you know that

have of reidy have movies and movie
schedule has been posted a few different

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,630
areas look around for it or stop by the
end for desk on seconds there's a reason

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,940
to sleep at all

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,270
the entire weekend i urge you to

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,800
highly overrated

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,910
beyond

25
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:28,020
uh... the network is dated a little bit
every year we are state were uh...

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,789
seeking stability

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,790
and we may find it

28
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,430
remain joya

29
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,480
uh...

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,340
they tell me i join helen says that i
have brief ones are off for the third

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,050
attract session hard to keep in mind
we're offering third track in the what

32
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,690
we call of the uh... see a room which is
a madison room up the hallway to your

33
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,700
left

can loan you a very uh...

36
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,159
uh... computer factor if you'd like
would be really happy to be a list sign

37
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,490
up to talk about almost anything

38
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,820
that u dot a character related to the
conference theme

39
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,349
the sign up sheet i think is now are
right next to that see room

40
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,629
for madison say welcome to uh... to get
involved with that in the uh... be a

41
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:20,779
presenter an addition to being an
attendee

42
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:24,029
other thing i mentioned briefly because
we had a very good crowd for the locks

43
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:25,569
picking workshop

44
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:31,259
this afternoon from uh... about two till
five down an area eight of the

45
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,829
second-floor attended a lien

46
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:36,049
there'll be a lock pick workshop again
tomorrow

47
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:40,299
and will announce a time it'll either be
uh... starting during the uh... wise

48
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,389
keynote afterlife baking panel

49
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,449
or the after right after the uh... the
wise keynote there'll be one of those

50
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:51,059
two for a couple hours the afternoon so
stay tuned for details

51
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:53,959
uh... lastly we are still on

52
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,139
a little bit short handed not too
terribly build all sort had in summer

53
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,589
audio-visual probably couple of other
other other areas as well but if you're

54
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:04,290
interested in now and spend a little
time on camera gap experience

55
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,519
if you have experience

56
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:11,259
id experience on-camera allied to
consider stopping by the eighty table

57
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,229
back there and i'll take it kartik cell
number some like that and uh... try to

58
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,370
get on the schedule

59
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,819
for a few hours shift

60
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,689
okay without further delay

61
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:21,358
this talk is

62
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:28,359
crypto phone

63
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:36,689
i don't know how many of you are then

64
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:39,469
two years ago to my presentation back
then

65
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,019
when i said we're almost done with this
great krypton telephone that we were

66
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,549
building

67
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:46,509
we actually did get done uh...

68
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:50,639
today i get to talk a little bit about
the things that happened

69
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,119
how it all came out what we actually
ended up doing technically

70
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,919
and a little bit about

71
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,089
what happened afterwards

72
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:01,350
the presentation i'm going to be looking
back to the screen

73
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,959
the same screen you're seeing a lot of
time because my

74
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,239
notebook for some reason at this
resolution can't do both screens at the

75
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,369
same time which is annoying

76
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:12,000
i'm going to describe a little bit

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,730
our world view as we see one of our
intersection is developing what the

78
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,599
world looks like at least from our point
of view

79
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:23,469
more violence specifically g_s_ m
interception we're going to become bring

80
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:25,110
a little bit of the technology

81
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,680
how does intersection were courageous
that's where is it your where is your

82
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,580
phone calls being intercepted

83
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,449
then we're gonna talk a little bit about
the trip to fall

84
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:37,529
what we set out to do how we technically
dated

85
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:38,939
and then

86
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,399
i'm going to be talking a little bit
about how the crypto phone camino rsa

87
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,229
cure if more people actually

88
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:45,899
were taken to look at the deeper

89
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,470
technical insight today

90
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,889
drinks water

91
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:59,989
okay i think we can safely say that
today we live in the interception age

92
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:02,139
no form of any critical tronic

93
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,139
committee she have any kind is secure

94
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,939
wherever you use the phone

95
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,639
it can be intercepted

96
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,729
there's many many many interception
points on all networks will be covering

97
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,818
a lot of that later in the

98
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,610
in the technical slides

99
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,169
and the political risks in economic
damage from eavesdropping

100
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,580
by government of private organizations
have huge

101
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,310
so who's intercepting theirs

102
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,389
law enforcement agencies of course

103
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,120
intelligence agencies organized
criminals

104
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,500
corporations

105
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,560
private investigators and just
interested amateurs

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,800
all depending on how easy it is to
intercept respect certain kind of

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,280
traffic

108
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,460
and what the stakes are

109
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,250
so let's first talk a little bit about
intelligence-gathering by the way of

110
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,830
anyone has any questions

111
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,659
just jump up ask your questions i'm not
good at speaking for like forty five

112
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,889
minutes and then

113
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,469
having question gestures

114
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,099
come up to the mike and i'll be talking
for like ten minutes and then somebody

115
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,188
can ask a few questions again

116
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,160
on the previous live it's that there are
uh... he can only disadvantages alone

117
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,349
buying on people mister i think

118
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,959
what is that d potential for economic
damages future if you if your

119
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,050
conversation sir you're

120
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,820
privileged communication of any kind if
that is intercepted

121
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,219
the potential for economic damage

122
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,259
is huge

123
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,539
if you are a corporate entity or even a
country

124
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:36,539
people could hurt you

125
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,569
interception increasingly targets

126
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,350
everyone whole populations

127
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,499
not just a few select targets not even

128
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:48,330
a lot of select targets but let's just
get everything

129
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,699
and the new enemy

130
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,519
terrorism whatever you call it is all of
us

131
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,939
course it's always been all of us the
enemy has always been among us

132
00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:01,460
now the enemy's among us

133
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,680
there is great incentive

134
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,030
for intelligence for countries for

135
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,739
the security establishment to basically
get all of us

136
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:11,909
released our traffic

137
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:15,979
and this of course a huge potential for
abuse

138
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,998
so why would they be selective

139
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:22,179
ethics regulations what's stopping them

140
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:25,860
most countries have very little in the
way of legal oversight

141
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,039
uh... i come from a country which is
number two in the world in terms of

142
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,919
using

143
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,499
interception

144
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:34,730
both from other law enforcement and
intelligence uh...

145
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,669
bureaucracies

146
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,250
and come from the netherlands by the way
and we are we rank very high on

147
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,270
intercepting phone calls

148
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,318
even if there is legal oversight it's
usually rubber stamping

149
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,869
uh... requests for forty two cents

150
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:58,280
there's a whole thing called lawful
access

151
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,250
xlost lack says too

152
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,809
voice communications lawful access to

153
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:04,240
internet traffic

154
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,629
there's all industry alan

155
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:08,399
on doing that

156
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,319
of course most countries don't have

157
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,879
even laws covering it they don't have
judicial oversight so most countries

158
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,609
lawful access just needs

159
00:08:15,609 --> 00:08:16,659
whatever

160
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:21,688
whoever wants to listen happens to be
currently in power

161
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:24,929
whatever legal protection you have is
going to that parade

162
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:26,599
over the next

163
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,699
years over the next month's

164
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:32,430
and until then the logistic norad

165
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,650
even if your government cares other
governments care even less

166
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,919
and of course the government's all have
swapping agreements it's it's long been

167
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,240
a trade for say the u_s_ government and
the british government

168
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,310
to spy on each other's dissidents

169
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,900
they could claim they're not spying on
on their own domestic

170
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,050
insurgence

171
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,560
than the british would do it for the
americans the american do it for the

172
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,189
british and they would stop them

173
00:08:56,189 --> 00:09:01,030
information gathered

174
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,980
says technology stopping them

175
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,090
we did a little bit of a calculation

176
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,410
much of would cost to store everything
that is all phone calls

177
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,930
and we get that for the country of
germany which is a population of

178
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,640
eighteen of eighty five million

179
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,750
multiply all these figures by two to two
and a half

180
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,590
you get the u_s_ figures

181
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,610
if you recall that everything at four
point eight kilobits per second which

182
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,220
gets you pretty decent voice

183
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,740
there's three hundred nineteen billion
minutes of fixed network all stats about

184
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,590
ten peta bites worth of data

185
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,100
which and these are very high estimates
i'd

186
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,360
was just part of building a pet a bite

187
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,550
helping out the internet archive and we
actually came out a lot cheaper than

188
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,830
this

189
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,210
these are high estimates for keeping
that data available on spinning disk

190
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,170
where people can actually access it and
analyze it

191
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,990
thirty million dollars

192
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,240
the thirty two billion minute suggestion
traffic is three million dollars

193
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,350
in very small print there is the u_s_
intelligence budget which is twenty

194
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,950
seven billion dollars a year

195
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,330
says you can see

196
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:12,190
reporting everything every single phone
call on a large network for for a large

197
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,450
isn't hard is and expensive

198
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,720
isn't difficult

199
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,680
the the type of storage needed is the
type of storage of private organizations

200
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,240
are building right now for other things

201
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,880
this is not some future mound of data

202
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,290
that only an intelligence companies
corporation could have

203
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,530
so technology is not a stopper

204
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,880
for storing everything of course

205
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,959
you could assume

206
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,490
that they're certain cause you want to
keep much longer than other calls

207
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,510
this is if you wanna really keep
everything you can say well

208
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,819
calls too

209
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,850
call centres for utility companies are
probably not that interesting so we can

210
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,260
expire them after three months

211
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,930
calls between individuals are much more
potentially interesting

212
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,170
you could do network analysis and try to
figure out how

213
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,469
interesting somebody is or how
interesting his friends are

214
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,530
build your whole expiry algorithm around
that you don't have to

215
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:13,530
choose to to expire at the whole data
for all the country at the same time

216
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,500
then there's non-government intersection

217
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,730
is now problems related to our offer as
intersection of calls reported all over

218
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,730
the world

219
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,150
it's no longer just be guys no longer
just

220
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,110
marjorie nice crime there's

221
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,310
just a street-level criminals

222
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,920
the world over that art

223
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,140
getting their hands on intersection here

224
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,879
many countries still have analogue phone
networks analog

225
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,530
cellular networks

226
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,430
and also digital gear is becoming more
marxists there's more

227
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,370
slides on that later on

228
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,850
equipments gonna get cheaper and cheaper

229
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,380
and the communications landscape is
gonna get weirder and we order

230
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,600
many more people are string to start
offering voice services there's going to

231
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,720
be many different voice-over i_p_
services mauled by a high p_ services

232
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,580
and this whole world is going to serve

233
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,290
mention intermingle

234
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,180
over the next few years

235
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,260
there's no incentive for any operators
to offer anything that's unbroken

236
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,350
why would date

237
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,240
and even if they did

238
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,460
the caller still d crafted as soon as it
reaches the land as soon as it

239
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,510
stops

240
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,450
being on the air

241
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,140
as soon as it's d crafted

242
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,860
of course

243
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,840
people in their own companies have
access to that

244
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,020
so let's focus a little bit on mobile
interception

245
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,130
it's going to be an out of control
problem

246
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,110
at least in the public view much faster
than anything else

247
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,110
because there's no state monopoly
anybody can listen to the airwaves and

248
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:51,110
the equipment for instance for g_s_ and
it's going to be more more accessible

249
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,200
all cell phone systems are broken

250
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,220
there are no cell phone systems that do
end to end encryption between the phones

251
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,060
there are no cell phone systems

252
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,990
that really protects the content of your
call

253
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,510
as just to keep

254
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,260
your basic lobbyists with the scanner
out nothing else yeah

255
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,350
yeah uh... actually saba someone beckley
into only silva governments or something

256
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,730
but there are selling out yet senator
scepter right think like

257
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,660
three quarters of a million they could
do like the new r

258
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,819
like uh... not

259
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,440
wave breached g_s_ m stuff

260
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,930
and uh...

261
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,490
outta i was uh...

262
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,320
they are don't brady tales of how they
do that do you think that there's some

263
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,600
sort of backdoor built in the g_s_a_ rm

264
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,840
or uh... we actually found a company in
india there's no there's some slides on

265
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,640
that but there's a company in india

266
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,590
that uh... has built for eighty thousand
uh... eighty thousand dollars i think

267
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,530
uh... for channel interception device

268
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,449
that does eighty five one eight five two
which is the most used encryption

269
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,550
algorithms for a purge s_m_

270
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,740
and there's a company in rumania have
that brit off their software built their

271
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,890
own hardware rounded they sell it for
four thousand dollars

272
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,740
plus others

273
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,610
for channel here for four k

274
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,270
a quarter of a million is a little
expenses

275
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,090
yet but i'm sure there's plenty of
companies that still sell it to plenty

276
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,530
of governments for that price theirs

277
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,730
but that they have

278
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,410
but today have some sort of like uh... i
guess x zero j breach of encryption app

279
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,250
preacher of the uh... a flaw in the
algorithm oris

280
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,820
this is like for a over the air
interception

281
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,730
may let me get to that because there's a
couple slides on that in the store sort

282
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:39,360
of do do a short break and and talk
about a bit about yourself

283
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,870
there is a man in the middle attack

284
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,740
this is the

285
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,730
the old-style interception

286
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,820
interception that law enforcement
sometimes uses the intersection that

287
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,760
intelligence

288
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,950
used to use

289
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,990
the world over before they were using as
passive gear

290
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,690
there is a man in the middle attack
because g_s_ emas very strong

291
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:56,830
authentication

292
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,070
of the user towards the network

293
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,500
if i'm a g s end user of my sim is
actually a fairly strong means

294
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,250
authenticate myself

295
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,830
as a legitimate user towards the network

296
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,890
how'd you some works

297
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,750
if i'm roaming on a network

298
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,489
uh... that network will ask my home
provider

299
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:18,119
for us education information for me and
my home provider will send what is

300
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:20,320
called triplets

301
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,160
the roaming network

302
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,680
these triplets contain

303
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,820
at challenge called s rent

304
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,290
that no sorry rand

305
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,599
uh... a response that i need to give
which is called as rents

306
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,510
anna content ki

307
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,250
the network engineer and

308
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,410
i provide back

309
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,519
from calculating

310
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,210
the the thing that's in my sim

311
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,880
the secret that's in my sim i use a
calculation

312
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,010
i provide as rare as the answer which
authenticate smita works and at work

313
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,650
and then the content ke is used to
scramble to communication

314
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,640
however

315
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,340
the network never authenticate stew meat

316
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,320
certified

317
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,730
walk up to someone with a device that
says i am now the network

318
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,720
my phone will happily log into it

319
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,550
of course

320
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,210
this device doesn't have my secrets of
the device can know the content keyed to

321
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,580
the device can see

322
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,050
all by the way this is uh... network in
a uh... in a country that is not very

323
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,640
trusted c iraq before

324
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,750
you guys went in there

325
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,440
i a m

326
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,560
i have my phone which i don't think that
case we just don't do any encryption

327
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,930
said so i would have a of oil i would
set up a phone call through this box and

328
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,700
this box on the other end would have a
normal jess and phone or pretend to be a

329
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,860
normal chisholm for on some other cm and
would pass my call back out

330
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,060
this is a detectable attack

331
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,589
it's an attack like and i can

332
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:43,890
see if i'm an expert i consider figure
out

333
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,230
analyzing what goes on in the air

334
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,380
that i'm being attacked and there's also
other giveaways like

335
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,570
if you have no cooperation with uh...
g_s_ m provider

336
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,320
the other side would not see caller i_d_

337
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,990
even if they're used to seeing caller
i_d_ with for me of course the networks

338
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,420
are

339
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,990
sufficiently broken that you don't see
caller i_d_ all the time if you

340
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,069
just walk around with your g_s_ and
phone

341
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,460
then there's passive

342
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,720
g_s_ m interception there's been some
breakthroughs against a five one

343
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,039
uh... a five to the other algorithm has
always been broken

344
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,429
there's been all sorts of breakthroughs
against yes m

345
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:23,170
there's now a uh... i think something
where you have four terra bytes of data

346
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:28,809
you do a pre calculation you calculate a
table that's for terra bites in size

347
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:30,030
out within

348
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,550
uh...

349
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,620
if you had

350
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,789
i don't have the numbers off hand but
there's there's an near real-time

351
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,170
interception for forgy s_m_

352
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,450
with very modest

353
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,480
equipment

354
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,809
passive interceptions not noticeable

355
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,860
unlike p_n_g_ catcher

356
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,590
and they're both on the open market and
as i just said they're not very

357
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,449
expensive

358
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,360
then there's the microwave links

359
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,710
all these g_s_ m cells are often
connected with microwave in these

360
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,909
microwave

361
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,450
often have large amounts of calls

362
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,679
stacked into one

363
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,830
migrating to all the cells and if you
have like one of these master cells that

364
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,158
are on the fiber

365
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:09,870
that hosts

366
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,960
what is called the bay station
controller

367
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,670
they have microwaves going out in
fifteen different directions to all

368
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,820
these other cells

369
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,860
if you sit right next to that

370
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,779
and you listen to all these microwave
because of the all

371
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:24,490
overlap there'd been they're not street
point-to-point they all

372
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,590
wave out a little bit

373
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,100
if you listen to all these migrate
connection she get

374
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,090
many many many phone calls coming in at
the same time

375
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,439
there also teaching to set its sights
less than forty k of equipment to get

376
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,900
many many many calls for michael parts
of the city

377
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,810
all in one go

378
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,850
so what do you do against this there is

379
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,950
lots of mobile arson creeks and stuff
available

380
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,330
however

381
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,939
it's all sort of weird they all use most
of the news ten twenty four victory

382
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,440
exchanges

383
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,090
ten twenty four bits is i think by now
generally recognized is not enough

384
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,020
one twenty eight bit session keys

385
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,930
proprietary algorithms

386
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,840
black boxes she can't really see what's
going on inside

387
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,370
they're closed source of there's lots of
rumors that many of them are back toward

388
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,860
most of the companies the build enough
close ties to the people that

389
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,440
interceptor phone calls have close ties
to either the n_s_a_ or to the g c h q

390
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,820
britain

391
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,830
the french services the german services
to boone is now she's convinced whatever

392
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,060
they're all called

393
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,370
the same companies that supply dear to
them also supply secure telephones

394
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,330
which makes you wonder

395
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,970
they often use their own hardware which
has advantages and and also a lot of

396
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,160
disadvantages

397
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,100
there never modern phones

398
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,670
use lots of batteries often

399
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:57,240
they're expensive in their sometimes
very very difficult to use

400
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,180
i guess i'm going to talk a little bit
about what we did the creek to form but

401
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,110
if anybody has any questions on g s_m_
intersection in general

402
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,860
how that works

403
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,669
what uh...

404
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:10,850
scale of that is

405
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,860
better to walk up to them

406
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,380
how does the microwave work

407
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,820
how does a migrant work

408
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,330
at mica weight is just a means they used
to come

409
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,760
the cells they call bay station
controllers to all the outlying cells

410
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,460
so i given area may be covered by
fifteen or twenty or thirty transmitting

411
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,390
towers

412
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,770
and only two of those may actually be
connected to the fixed network

413
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,830
and they talk via microwave antennas to
all the other

414
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,629
towers that are near there

415
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,260
they make convenient point speedy
central sales make convenient points

416
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,039
forgetting

417
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,470
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
phone calls

418
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:55,470
with just one antenna

419
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,190
jerry

420
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:02,789
it's really hard to

421
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:06,129
you talk about the doctrine

422
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,940
to talk about the duncan campbell report
and how that and show how this applies

423
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,309
to everybody

424
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:14,750
about estline and montauk about the dont
tema report

425
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,200
go ahead had don't think that i know
enough about the subject

426
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,360
orbiting a report done for the european
commission it was called the stolen

427
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,520
report as to your way

428
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,510
if you google foraging he'd find it

429
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,370
and it was a report done by duncan
campbell of england

430
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,400
and uh... it basically try to uncovered

431
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,520
that uh... interception wasn't

432
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,190
being done selectively it wasn't being
done

433
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,420
against specific targets that were on
some lester that were

434
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,820
monitored by intelligence but that
basically

435
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,908
specifically uh... an organization set
up by the u_k_ in the u_s_ aging

436
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,930
uh... called the u_k_ u_s_ intelligence
alliance

437
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,880
was basically sucking in everybody's
phone calls

438
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,160
but they're also decrease for certain
organizations and other people that they

439
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,150
would watch and talked about that as
well

440
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,120
right uh... yeah they they were they
were looking for certain organizations

441
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,059
ah... ngos such as green peace but also
many others

442
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,770
yes there are watchlists of course there
are

443
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,860
there are also looking specifically but
there were also pulling in traffic from

444
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,770
just everybody

445
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,360
how difficult is the microwave

446
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,340
interception differently with whips

447
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,899
if you think you have the equipment
which is which is very generic

448
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,380
it's not that difficult at all it's just
basically receiving aid to make a bit or

449
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,340
a stack of to make a big carriers

450
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,240
political you're too so we're talking
and buy you want nor

451
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,150
the three rd it's really i'm i'm

452
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,100
referring to the european situation in
europe they are to make a big carriers

453
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,460
to make it it stacked

454
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,890
signals in the two mega bits are
actually just uh... uh...

455
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,670
uh... primary retires ta and basically

456
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,830
with signaling information added instead
of the

457
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,029
the and signaling

458
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:59,320
duodenum i quit manufacturer scramble
those in transit

459
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,090
supposedly yes

460
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,730
but lots of people from that industry
told me privately that that it's never

461
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,940
used and that they

462
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,970
have that or maybe a few sensitive links

463
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,620
they may have a on the cell tower that
serves the president's house but they

464
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:19,620
don't have it anywhere else in

465
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,490
so all the interception methods that
you've mentioned so far

466
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:26,820
are kinda limited geographically and
scope as they were wireless are you

467
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,080
there at the tower or what not does the
chisum standard

468
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,070
to find wired side of things to and
would that be another interception point

469
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,960
religious in standard defines lots of
stuff about protocols that are also used

470
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,330
on on the wired and

471
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,109
of course there's lots of interception
happening just that pat

472
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:48,120
undersea cables everywhere there there's

473
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,350
it's very

474
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,460
uh...

475
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,240
it's a very

476
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,380
uh...

477
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,460
i would say

478
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,399
uh... well defined industry

479
00:23:56,399 --> 00:24:00,009
mhm it's a very large industries a very
well defined industry and basically

480
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:03,080
everything is for sale for for any
bitrate

481
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,539
anne signaling system they can get the
the corresponding intersection here in

482
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:11,940
storage here

483
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,270
sought we set out to do

484
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,679
is to build strong an easy to use words
encryption

485
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,330
the putting the hands of everybody who
wants and needs it

486
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,908
because the other thing is even though
all these other

487
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,500
all this other equipment that you can
buy a is is

488
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,970
as far as we're concerned at least
suspect

489
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:27,919
and some of it is just

490
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,929
very obviously broken

491
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,570
they still pretend that you have to be a
government customer to be able to buy

492
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:38,610
this stuff and it's hot and we just
don't sell to everybody

493
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,810
and we eventually

494
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,040
would like to see end to end encryption
and two and strong and verifiable

495
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,129
encryption

496
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,690
in the hands of everybody

497
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,330
we'd like to license or or or somehow

498
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,530
make sure that this technology ends up
in every cell phone and every phone

499
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,029
around the world

500
00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:00,309
it took a while we were working on our
product since two thousand one

501
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:03,690
started at anew company called yes
indeed crypto farm

502
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,909
incorporated in berlin germany

503
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:09,529
they were selling the crib default it's
november

504
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:13,670
there were very very glad that it's not
just spooks and creeps that by

505
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,200
we were sort of afraid that we would
only be selling to uh...

506
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,910
the government of country x and and the
special forces of countrywide and all we

507
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,000
have the

508
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,410
the gentleman that brought the suit case
of money

509
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,000
amber gbr very glad to see that we
actually

510
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,370
are seeing interest from ngos the do
good things we're seeing interest

511
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,350
random companies that have an obvious
interest in protecting their information

512
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,690
research departments

513
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,720
pharmaceutical firms that just

514
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,670
companies that have information to
protect and that are beginning to

515
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,779
realize

516
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,390
but they're spending a lot of money
protecting their

517
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,419
infrastructure in any other way

518
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:00,019
that the most sensitive information is
actually passed by phone

519
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:03,650
this companies that spend millions on
protecting their computer networks

520
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,940
and they realize that

521
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,370
the real stuff

522
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,230
when they come out of the meeting

523
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,650
and they got the deal or or are they
didn't get the deal

524
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:18,650
they just brought into the car grab
their phones and start calling people

525
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,799
we got it right and phone it's got to
cut two phone two hundred of the showing

526
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,480
some pictures later on

527
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,529
this with the riot version at the right
as a satellite phone system

528
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,110
that is not really here but it's in most
of europe and the indian ocean region of

529
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,830
africa

530
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,520
his landline i_o_c_ expires ten p a_b_
expirations all coming up soon

531
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,820
we're doing well work are still positive
and where one hundred percent owned by

532
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,210
the employees who were still independent

533
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,130
this is it

534
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,500
as you can see

535
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,220
that's the phone we sell and this is the
free windows thirty-two client were

536
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,730
giving out that you can use any modem
with

537
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,180
to talk to that

538
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,910
as you can see the user interface on
both is sort of similar

539
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:09,910
in fact it's exactly the same

540
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:20,168
it doesn't

541
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:25,220
windows being windows

542
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,130
so what are we set out to do

543
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,320
we wanted to create maximum security

544
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,980
without sacrificing the usability of how
to be very very easy to use

545
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,760
so we didn't want to stick in a nikon
figuration dialogues it reb

546
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,879
worked very hard to make the product non
geeky

547
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,250
we want to make it not are not much more
complicated

548
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,710
images and phone

549
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,820
it should also work on

550
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,700
most if not all jess m networks that
have to be low bandwidth

551
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,460
uh... i'll be talking about that later
on

552
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,320
and it had to work on the current
generation of p_d_a_ phones

553
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,490
we also wanted to make sure that the
technology we used to the protocols we

554
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,000
used was on encumbered

555
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,690
this is our product we sell it we vote
to code

556
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,350
however

557
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,190
we want to make sure that people could
build phones that we need to robbery

558
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,550
rivet we don't want to

559
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,559
locked people into just buying phones
for months

560
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,850
who want to create something that
everybody could interrupt request

561
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,389
many we couldn't use anything that was
patented or closed source or

562
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:29,050
somehow in another way encumbered

563
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,090
we want to be able to publish the source

564
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:36,140
so people could read it will be getting
back to that

565
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,150
case we looked at a lot of existing
solutions

566
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,850
of course we knew a lot of these things
already and we wanted to see what we

567
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,880
could learn and we want to see why

568
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,270
what we were going to do was in there
yet

569
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:50,590
uh... speak freely in not listen pgp
phone i should have

570
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,480
semi discontinued projects on the
internet

571
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,160
to create phones that either do i p your
use modems

572
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,570
so they had to use the internet to
communicate with me

573
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,870
talked over

574
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,770
basically landlines

575
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,510
some were discontinued

576
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,129
somewhere to eat too hard to use

577
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,700
or they don't work over g_s_ ends

578
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,320
many things might be wrong with them

579
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,189
first you could run aged three to three
which is the dissident voice-over i'd be

580
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,890
standard protocol

581
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,610
and use it over i p sec

582
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,120
we found it to be way too high latency

583
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,159
way too complicated to be running over
tsn

584
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,490
their skype

585
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:36,210
which is done by the people that created
peer to peer networks

586
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,190
but we didn't find a crip we didn't find
them to think

587
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,660
long and hard enough about the crypto
and also

588
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,680
it didn't work on phone lines

589
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,680
then there's a range of companies
creating commercial phones

590
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,010
both landline ngos and phones

591
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,549
the problems that i just mention apply

592
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:55,899
there's no source code available to them
so we can't

593
00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:58,270
say that there really doing with her

594
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,100
supposed to be doing

595
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,410
otherwise acceptable solutions like
portability and the ability to work over

596
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,200
to send the notion lucien

597
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,690
has interoperability we can talk using a
computer and some piece of software and

598
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,090
using nice

599
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,590
jason phone

600
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,860
then came the worry of wondering what
platform we were going to use that the

601
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,200
first telephone that was remotely
powerful enough to do this was the nokia

602
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,890
n ninety to ten the flip open
communicator

603
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,080
we spend a good part of the year

604
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,870
trying to work on it only to find that
that

605
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,650
there was almost no developer
information were not

606
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,000
at present a mass market product

607
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
we don't have a million

608
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,450
customers were not

609
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,560
realnetworks during a real player on
your device

610
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,850
so we have to convince people to give us
developer support in developer support

611
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,029
we found was severely lacking

612
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:54,890
we also found that nokia ways at that
time very internally confused they

613
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,850
didn't even know that the new stuff

614
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,870
and then we look at windows cd slash
pocket pc we found it to be surprisingly

615
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,160
open

616
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,170
contrary to the desktop windows

617
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,590
most of the o_s_ source code is actually
open and downloadable today

618
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,929
uh... there's lots of devices

619
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,730
and there's a very high power p_d_a_
phones

620
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,880
the phone ever currently running on

621
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,390
is a four hundred megahertz phone four
hundred-meter attack scale

622
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,350
so the power is available

623
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,440
crazy enough window see is the most open

624
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,330
available ask that you can buy on the
market

625
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,279
we opted for the h_d_ seema liable just
the phone

626
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,160
was in the pictures

627
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,850
ful

628
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,100
performances

629
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,930
that's right

630
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,360
it's this fall this is the correct the
phone

631
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,929
it's an h d_c_ in the lion over to sells
it as the x_-two to to his head

632
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:56,509
uh... european phone company

633
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:01,850
it's also sold as the m_t_a_ to by t
mobile

634
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,890
krista crypt two forms an ideal a
petition for p_d_a_ phone

635
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:10,630
this is a tri-band phones richard work
everywhere

636
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,539
pocket pc irwin seeee

637
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,900
scared us

638
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:19,260
and i think most operating system should
scare anyone that builds a secure form

639
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,549
because they have lots of

640
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:24,970
things in there they have uh...

641
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:28,480
they may have instant messaging and evil

642
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,680
they may have all sorts of clients open

643
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,610
there's all sorts of stuff happening on
that phone that you really don't want to

644
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,220
be happening on a secure telephone

645
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,940
so we created what we call them

646
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,250
security profile manager

647
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,690
to basically set what security mode you
want to operate in and based on that

648
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,380
security mode we ruthlessly disable

649
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,850
all sorts of things that they normally
turn on in this phone

650
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,330
we basically ko internet explorer will
kill all sorts of other things on this

651
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,320
farm until

652
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,419
they become something we trust remember

653
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,919
this is a much more compact operating
system

654
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,930
say desktop windows or or or any other
desktop operating system

655
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,219
so you can actually have some level

656
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:08,940
of trust

657
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,149
what's going on there there is a limited
number of ways in which it can be broken

658
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:18,090
then we put our own key in the upgrade
mechanism

659
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,149
so nobody but us

660
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:23,600
will be supplying upgrades for that
phone afterwards

661
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,259
now we protect against uses installing
binaries

662
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:27,150
we turn on

663
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,270
the built-in protection mechanism

664
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:32,230
course users can turn it off we supply
them with the password

665
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,380
good to have a question

666
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,580
as this is the throughway finger can you
incur conference cause of this

667
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,860
technology

668
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,200
it's currently a two-way thing we do not
have conference bridges

669
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,989
and

670
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:43,460
conference calls

671
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,649
at between

672
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:48,550
units without a conference bridge is
actually

673
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,720
it's difficult by by the way the network
works because you don't have the

674
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,730
bandwidth

675
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,390
to get the data from everyone to
everyone

676
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,700
there's there's a problem with that and
and and

677
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,059
the way it works thanks

678
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,460
can you walk up to the microphone 'cause
it's really hard for others to

679
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:13,460
understand what you're saying

680
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:24,049
yet white guys throws eighth wrote the
probable eighth

681
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,179
picture three

682
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,689
migrant

683
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:28,469
instead sleep

684
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,729
or pickle

685
00:34:30,729 --> 00:34:32,949
why you guys

686
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:37,830
tool to use instituted no we do not with
iraqi we use our own protocol

687
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,779
all we use our own protocol for the
reason that we uh... the juice and

688
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,369
channel is very

689
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,459
uh... is very weird and he's very narrow
band

690
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:49,750
so we we didn't want to waste any bits

691
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,728
on protocol overhead

692
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:52,720
'cause basically all the

693
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,509
bits you waste and up into the agency

694
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:03,279
which is a nice lead into this slide

695
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:05,409
we use circuit switched data

696
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:08,999
jess and i was basically a couple of
data mostar's circuit switched data

697
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:11,040
which is the oldest g s n

698
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,519
data call its ninety six hundred data

699
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,729
then there's eight u_c_s_d_ which i
think was never introduced in america

700
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:21,979
uh... it's high-speed circuit switched
data where you can use

701
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:25,899
nineteen to and i think even higher like
thirty eight hundred

702
00:35:25,899 --> 00:35:27,909
for thirty eight thousand

703
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:31,639
but it was never vegan america is big in
germany i think is the only country that

704
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,149
it ever took off in

705
00:35:34,149 --> 00:35:39,209
and then there's gpr s the packet
switched mode for transferring data

706
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:42,479
the problem with a just csd is that it's
not available everywhere

707
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:47,269
the problem with gpr s is that the
latency is high and it's unpredictable

708
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:50,419
we measured latency up into the three
second range

709
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:52,229
for gpr s

710
00:35:52,229 --> 00:35:55,910
which is way unacceptable for voice
calls and it's also very in predictable

711
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,058
there's there's a large amount of jeter

712
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:01,539
one time it's one moment is one and a
half seconds an xml minutes three

713
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:04,279
seconds

714
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:06,749
csd is available pretty much everywhere

715
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:09,379
although you may need subscription sims
for it

716
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:13,549
uh... we try to do csd on every prepaid
sim we could buy a year

717
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,239
so we don't have subscriptions

718
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:20,629
and we couldn't get it to work

719
00:36:20,629 --> 00:36:23,819
an eraser in

720
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:27,159
even csd even though it's much less late
into the latency is much more

721
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:31,629
predictable even csd introduces latency

722
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:32,919
these providers

723
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:35,658
when they designed the network wanted to
make sure that they were the ones

724
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:39,249
offering voice services at the design
tear data services to be intentionally

725
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:40,509
crappy enough

726
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:43,889
where people wouldn't want to use them
for boys

727
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:49,579
which of course is our problem

728
00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:52,379
there's a number of ways you can get
around dealing with that see those

729
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:55,029
properties of csd in one is not to use
it

730
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:55,920
you could

731
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,389
use the voice channel to transfer your
bets

732
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:02,399
of course whatever you try to transfer

733
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:04,598
going through the g_s_a_ in kodiak

734
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,859
and then coming back out of the kids yes
and kodak on the other and so you have

735
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,429
to make a signal

736
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,869
that survives being

737
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:15,289
voice code act annan voice codec

738
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:17,860
even though the g_s_a_ in codec uses the
wrong

739
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,890
genzyme frames

740
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,868
so gets about fourteen came bits per
second

741
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,739
the amount of bits you could reliably
get through that connection if you

742
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:30,089
wanted to use it for data has about one
point eight kilobits

743
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:31,828
which is way too little

744
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:36,849
for the type of codec that we use

745
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:39,609
codex at twelve hundred d_p_s_ either
sound like

746
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:46,609
these are laying on my own and they sona
biddle who knowing this

747
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:49,689
orange that

748
00:37:49,689 --> 00:37:52,469
if they don't sound like that they take
way way way too much processing power

749
00:37:52,469 --> 00:37:56,569
which we don't have a list devices

750
00:37:56,569 --> 00:38:00,349
we have been thinking about it as a
fallback mode for those that don't have

751
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:02,789
the date of calling it that are in
countries where there's no date of

752
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:04,339
caller

753
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:05,230
but we haven't

754
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,649
done that so yet

755
00:38:07,649 --> 00:38:10,459
you can make a very sophisticated
predictive system

756
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:14,339
and try to use all that ninety six
hundred bits per second that you have

757
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,899
answer to figure out when you have read
when you don't have it and and adjust

758
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:19,749
your quote a great appropriately

759
00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:22,289
or you can just use a codec

760
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:23,709
has

761
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:27,129
few enough that's where you have some
head room where you can actually make up

762
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,819
for the moments where you don't have the
ninety six hundred where there's a few

763
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:31,089
lost packets

764
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:32,849
you drive under a bridge

765
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:35,689
as if you lost packaging you have some
headroom

766
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,299
and make up for those sir

767
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:41,029
for those moments

768
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:44,299
we use a speech compression algorithm
called kelp

769
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:48,659
somewhat older dates developed as a
military standard

770
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,380
and we got to run on a two hundred
megahertz strong-arm which was the

771
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,410
previous model of cryptic former now on
a

772
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:56,178
for ameritech skills of the problem is
in this

773
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:59,989
stringent anymore as it was

774
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:01,899
decent speech quality four hundred

775
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:03,388
bits per second

776
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:07,399
there's a number of newer codecs

777
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:09,259
their speaks the smell

778
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:12,239
tsn a_m_r_ we're looking into some of
those

779
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,939
other ones have take too much processing
power or their early encumbered

780
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:19,549
patents copyrights

781
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:22,160
we want to be able to publish the source
code to what we do with there's plenty

782
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,979
of kodak's that we could buy

783
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:26,259
that come with a binary license

784
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:29,259
we don't want stuff in our executed
while that uh... that we only have the

785
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:32,399
binary to we want to be able to publish
the source

786
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:38,328
of everything that we do

787
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:41,339
let's talk a little bit about the crypto
that we do

788
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,299
as you can see

789
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,789
i can't really pointing it now because

790
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:45,569
mckenna

791
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:46,979
there we are

792
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:48,669
as you can see

793
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:51,859
we do a defeat hellman key exchange out
of which we get four thousand ninety-six

794
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,319
bitch which we then

795
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:55,449
put through shot two fifty six two

796
00:39:55,449 --> 00:39:59,039
basically extract the entropy in put
that in a two fifty six

797
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,980
that word

798
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,599
and then using some additions of a bite
and new showers we get

799
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,669
three keys which are mathematically
unrelated

800
00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:11,719
there based on the same two fifty six
dates but if you have one

801
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:15,089
you can't make your way back up to
another unless shot two fifty six is

802
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:17,269
fundamentally very very broken

803
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:21,089
in which gets lots of people have lots
of problems

804
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:22,069
then we use

805
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:24,949
book he has two fifty six and two fish

806
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:27,389
to encode these two

807
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:29,299
the speech

808
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:31,449
being thrown into the sex or here

809
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:35,949
three basically encrypting counter to
create a key stream anne's two p streams

810
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:39,559
are first exhorted than their exhort
with the voice and the user data

811
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,459
messages here basically the

812
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:43,009
call control messages

813
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,490
hangout diyo

814
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,929
all that stuff

815
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:50,699
we use a modified if he hellman exchange

816
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,029
without going into any of the technical
details of make sure that neither aliso

817
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:55,749
balkan cheat

818
00:40:55,749 --> 00:40:57,999
i'll get to that

819
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:59,699
what we do

820
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:03,599
he's we displayed during the call set up
after the call setup is completed

821
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,239
we display these

822
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,269
letters here these tues groups of three
letters

823
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:10,559
you say and partner says

824
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:13,949
what that does is it eliminates the man
in the middle without the need for a

825
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,910
public key infrastructure

826
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,129
if i call

827
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,719
somebody

828
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:21,839
know the voice of that person i know
what i'm talking to

829
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,939
and if i don't know what i'm talking to
my may have other problems keeping

830
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:26,489
secrets

831
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:29,659
if i know what i'm talking to our nor
the voice of that person

832
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,319
then if we

833
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:32,580
exchange this

834
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,369
these letters if i can see

835
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:38,109
exit w any other person says d_k_ ally

836
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:40,899
the two of us know that we're looking at
the same passion because we're looking

837
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,769
at the same ash we have the same key

838
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:47,199
in men in the middle although the man in
the middle could have two phones

839
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,069
and complet them back to back and just
look the audio through

840
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,710
the man in the middle could never

841
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,579
make sure that to let this dickey's that
are negotiated are the same

842
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,579
and hence

843
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:58,929
the hash displayed isn't the same

844
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:00,890
um... there's a lot of math behind it

845
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,569
there's a lot of meeting you can't do
there's some reading on our website

846
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:07,058
we have a large freak me ask questions
that

847
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:08,959
details as in much better

848
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,379
much higher level of detail that i can
do right now

849
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,119
we basically means is

850
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,029
two people can have a secure
communication without a central

851
00:42:16,029 --> 00:42:17,329
authority

852
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,329
saying who is who are sort of

853
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:25,489
uh... authorizing keys or or signing
stuff

854
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:29,459
we don't have device authentication we
don't have a web of trust

855
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:32,348
no centralized key management

856
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,659
positive bandages but we're looking at

857
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:37,599
implementing something like that

858
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,059
so people can have both they can have
both this type of education

859
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,260
or they could have

860
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,279
for instance role based authentication
which is where

861
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:50,059
i don't necessarily know when talking to
as a person but i know that i'm talking

862
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:50,800
to

863
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,569
whoever thought is authorized to

864
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:57,349
look into x for organization y

865
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:59,069
but we're looking into a nice

866
00:42:59,069 --> 00:43:03,308
d central and during that where also
organization that don't have formal

867
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:08,919
structures could still use that

868
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,848
then there's the symmetric crypto

869
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:15,359
as i show and we used to site first for
you say yes to fifty six and we used to

870
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,459
preach

871
00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:18,138
there's about very strong

872
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:21,380
or consider to be very strong crypto
algorithms

873
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,779
and we use both of them because we feel

874
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:27,509
eighty s two fifty six the encryption
standard currently

875
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:30,069
is still too young there may be some

876
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:32,829
we are security problem discovered in it

877
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:34,899
and we don't feel

878
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:35,999
confident in

879
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:37,440
depending on only one

880
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,770
even though we've gotten criticisms let
all your being overly paranoid this is

881
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,829
crazy

882
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:46,259
we don't claim it's five hundred and
twelve bit crypto we don't feel that

883
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:49,669
it's going to make her device twice and
secure we just feel it was the

884
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,388
conservative choice

885
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:58,779
we didn't use triple this because we
felt we needed to knew where

886
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:00,859
speed our isms

887
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:04,189
you have a question he said you're going
to be you have plans for implementing a

888
00:44:04,189 --> 00:44:09,919
peek a intuit is that going to probably
use an open pgp kade

889
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:12,799
we risk-taking abuser or on

890
00:44:12,799 --> 00:44:13,719
uh...

891
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:17,749
our own homegrown system for doing that
we were were thinking of

892
00:44:17,749 --> 00:44:21,419
creating a system where those keys can
be

893
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:24,679
exchange very easily during kollam where
people can

894
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:29,050
sign keys more more readily and where
it's more obvious to

895
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,429
to the

896
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:33,019
to joel random user what's going on

897
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:37,369
we feel that way pgp keys of currently
being treated is not very very obvious

898
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:44,369
to joel random years or what what's
happening

899
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,149
so quickly zap through slides because i
want to get into serb conversation and

900
00:44:49,149 --> 00:44:52,799
talk about the stuff of it

901
00:44:52,799 --> 00:44:55,129
there's the issue of p handling our
phone

902
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:58,739
if you have our phone in your hands and
you hang up everything about that call

903
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:01,919
is destroyed there's nothing you can
divulge except those six letters if you

904
00:45:01,919 --> 00:45:03,499
happen to remember them

905
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:08,329
those six letters only at ut tiny
representation of of a key affirm i've

906
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:08,670
had

907
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,599
der event of a session key

908
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,069
that you don't know

909
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:15,449
so there's nothing about that call that
you can reveal afterwards phone doesn't

910
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,939
remember anything about the call

911
00:45:17,939 --> 00:45:21,158
and we wanted to make very sure that we
delete the key

912
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:23,529
not deleting something from memory

913
00:45:23,529 --> 00:45:26,649
or desk or in the way it is a very hard
thing

914
00:45:26,649 --> 00:45:30,159
uh... but we do our best effort of of
making sure that the key is is gone as

915
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:36,829
we can make it gone

916
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:39,859
of course if they have physical access
to your phone

917
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:42,348
we're screwed

918
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,479
there's nothing in software that can
protect you from physical access

919
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:48,119
there's nothing you can do

920
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,570
as a software maker

921
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,939
that would protect the user

922
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:54,279
if nothing else an adversary

923
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:58,769
can just replaced the battery with a
battery that has a transmitter in it

924
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:01,440
they could place a room bug

925
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,150
uh... do all sorts of things to get to
your call can content once they have

926
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,559
access to your phone

927
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,959
or to the place where you normally use
it

928
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:14,078
take your phone wherever you go

929
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,219
notes

930
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:18,990
but the number one items in our manual
is this device is only

931
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,619
as secure as the way you keep it

932
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:25,949
these are just two slides i left in here

933
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,249
div quickly go over what we do on the
line it's not something i want to get

934
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:30,539
into now

935
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:33,789
too much level of detail but what we
basically do is we have an outer layer

936
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:37,679
and an internet your protocol

937
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:40,319
transfer the counter value basically the

938
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,520
the place where you are in the crypto
protocol so you know what the key

939
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,959
but the key for that pieces

940
00:46:46,959 --> 00:46:50,658
it's way too detailed for now

941
00:46:50,659 --> 00:46:54,399
and there's codec packets and what we
call user data packets which basically

942
00:46:54,399 --> 00:46:55,270
say

943
00:46:55,270 --> 00:47:02,270
what kodak is being used for that we're
now switching kodak

944
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:05,539
gripped a phone call

945
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,499
the program we wrote is now available
for balk at bc and for win thirty two

946
00:47:09,499 --> 00:47:15,359
they're both compiled from the same
kotha code base

947
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,150
this is some details it's written

948
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,149
using nfc

949
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:24,288
microsoft in and visual c microsoft bc
uh... we use new compiler for some parts

950
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:27,109
gcc

951
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:30,219
the backend

952
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:31,589
uh...

953
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:35,269
you we have symbian and inspirations
plan to pick up the phone

954
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,549
and protocol is open re

955
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:42,038
we publish what we do others can write
phones that talk to our phone

956
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:44,809
there's two processes

957
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:50,149
i'd guess this is not readable for any
of you is it

958
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:54,179
is basically a backend process which
once with real time priority

959
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:57,849
it handles all the calls that handles
the audio it talks to the speaker talks

960
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:59,359
to the to the line

961
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:06,359
it does the dis metric and corruption

962
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,879
and it also does the filtering it does
all that

963
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:11,659
all the codec stuff

964
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:16,189
and it takes all the cebu cycle starts
the process that does everything

965
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:19,469
and then there's the you i which does
the key exchange it talks to the user it

966
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:23,039
brings up a nice window

967
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,089
and also does the random number
generator

968
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:28,919
for this protocol we need random numbers

969
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:31,788
and we use for two now which is the
latest and greatest random number

970
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:33,139
generator

971
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:35,609
uh... we initialize it with a hash

972
00:48:35,609 --> 00:48:39,159
of some audio that we sample from the
microphone that's in the device

973
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:43,059
before the call start so we make very
sure that we start from

974
00:48:43,059 --> 00:48:47,749
is actually strong random

975
00:48:47,749 --> 00:48:48,959
so quick

976
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:52,319
going over the future roadmap of course
is this going to be i_s_d_n_ ta be

977
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,869
exhale really talked about that

978
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:59,049
we want a port two different platforms
we focus on mobile platforms of lennox

979
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:02,569
organizers as soon as something hits the
market that's big enough

980
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:05,069
that we want a portrait of course we're
going to be

981
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:07,019
we have a minute version

982
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:10,419
symbian is something that's on the road
map

983
00:49:10,419 --> 00:49:14,459
we want to do something with voice over
i'd be especially if mobile i p

984
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:18,499
u_n_ tns low latency mobile i p starts
hitting the market place we want to make

985
00:49:18,499 --> 00:49:21,079
sure that where there

986
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:25,099
and business cards a sort of the the the
name we gave to the concept of our own

987
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,459
p_p_i_

988
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:30,369
where you can have business cards as a
as a metaphor

989
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,629
for people to use

990
00:49:32,629 --> 00:49:37,909
to use the phone in that way

991
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:41,319
how do you assess how secure you could
to phone is

992
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:42,299
we basically

993
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:48,239
discerned four types of threats against
the creek to form their stuff

994
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,219
take most seriously as you store the
content of the critics call

995
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:56,589
you passively just listen to adjust or
the contents in the new later attack it

996
00:49:56,589 --> 00:49:59,308
that's the thing where most worried
about that something we stick most of

997
00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:01,069
our time in his making sure

998
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:04,259
that will hopefully never happened

999
00:50:04,259 --> 00:50:07,229
uh... there's active attacks during a
call

1000
00:50:07,229 --> 00:50:08,110
somebody

1001
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,359
playing the role of alice or bob

1002
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:11,348
towards one of the

1003
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:14,589
participants or may be calling one of
the participants

1004
00:50:14,589 --> 00:50:16,969
out of the blue pretending to be allison

1005
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:21,029
trying to get information from our
software are from the user

1006
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:24,389
that would compromise call content

1007
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:27,719
there's remote attacks against the rest
of the o_s_

1008
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:30,919
which worries us which is why rewrote
that security manager which is why we

1009
00:50:30,919 --> 00:50:32,069
kick off

1010
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:33,089
a lot of that

1011
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:35,058
p_d_a_ functionality

1012
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:38,409
when we turn it into a creek two phone

1013
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:42,179
and there's looking for radio emissions
from the device

1014
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:45,009
trying to figure out whether the device
transmits

1015
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:47,210
its key or something else

1016
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,859
that is useful to us

1017
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:51,859
in radio

1018
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:55,139
the security valuation needs to look at
the whole system the whole picture try

1019
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:57,970
to figure out how does an adversary what
is the

1020
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,100
the lowest hanging fruit for an
adversary to get to the content of that

1021
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:06,129
call

1022
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:09,649
at the phone does not protect against
moon bugging which is obvious bull

1023
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,409
you have to stated

1024
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:13,940
it is not protect against an adversary
to has ad

1025
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,069
access to the device even it was just
for a moment

1026
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:21,469
and it also does not protect against
rafters fleischman act in other words

1027
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:24,389
the compromising emissions radio attacks

1028
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:26,689
it is not a military grade

1029
00:51:26,689 --> 00:51:30,259
crypto device is not a ten thousand
dollar machine

1030
00:51:30,259 --> 00:51:31,899
however those attacks

1031
00:51:31,899 --> 00:51:33,719
they're very real

1032
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:36,569
you could face them but then a few face
them

1033
00:51:36,569 --> 00:51:37,649
you probably

1034
00:51:37,649 --> 00:51:40,759
much earlier would face room bugging

1035
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:42,849
you would face all sorts of other things

1036
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:46,880
and these attacks to not scale they
cannot be used to listen to the entire

1037
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,489
population

1038
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:49,730
we tried to make

1039
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:53,269
the best we can do on commercially
available hardware

1040
00:51:53,269 --> 00:51:56,769
that is the project the project is we
want to create something that works on

1041
00:51:56,769 --> 00:51:57,720
phones that

1042
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,339
that are available and open market

1043
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:05,439
and create security on it

1044
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:08,939
if you're osama bin laden you probably
don't want to use one of these you

1045
00:52:08,939 --> 00:52:10,379
probably want to

1046
00:52:10,379 --> 00:52:11,449
just meet

1047
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:13,219
somewhere in the bushes and

1048
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:15,439
talk release often

1049
00:52:15,439 --> 00:52:19,399
um...

1050
00:52:19,399 --> 00:52:23,249
we publish the source code and everybody
thinks it's really really cool

1051
00:52:23,249 --> 00:52:26,400
everybody says it's necessary we doing
the right thing yeah you publish the

1052
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,499
source code it's really important

1053
00:52:28,499 --> 00:52:31,529
everything i can get like a hundred
people applauding me for publishing the

1054
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:32,429
source code

1055
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,180
nobody ever looks at it

1056
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,579
just us

1057
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:39,899
that is bad

1058
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:42,420
we need lots of people to take a look

1059
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,990
see if they can find something in there
see just comment to assign say

1060
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:50,630
hay ab i'd looked at it i couldn't find
an obvious whole bit

1061
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:56,069
why did you guys do this or why does
that happen or why did you not

1062
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:59,419
we need people to take an interest in
what we've done and we needed to keep us

1063
00:52:59,419 --> 00:53:00,549
honest

1064
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:01,989
keeper shark

1065
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:05,429
and it's also our life insurance policy
we don't want to have

1066
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:09,939
sold thousands and thousands of secure
telephones to god knows who

1067
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:12,049
and be the only ones that no

1068
00:53:12,049 --> 00:53:15,329
in securities or have potential
knowledge of in securities we want lots

1069
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:16,319
of people

1070
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,788
to be looking at it to find holes in it
tell us about it so we can updated

1071
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:22,609
make fixes

1072
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:25,669
it's very unlikely that we've done a
perfect job

1073
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:26,598
right on

1074
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,809
redone of perfect job hole-in-one

1075
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:32,449
first time we wrote a uh... a secure
telephone a project this size

1076
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:34,839
we did perfect

1077
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:38,989
it's probably better than than most
things were at least we've looked at

1078
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:42,039
but we need help we need your help we
need help of everybody that can look at

1079
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:43,099
source code

1080
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:46,399
go over it even if it's just a tiny
piece if you can evaluate whether the

1081
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:49,739
random generator looks good to you

1082
00:53:49,739 --> 00:53:51,329
cockpit

1083
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:54,849
please do please publish on it

1084
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:57,539
tell us what you find tell the world
what you find

1085
00:53:57,539 --> 00:54:00,059
give us a little time if you find

1086
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:01,189
something

1087
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:03,689
something bad

1088
00:54:03,689 --> 00:54:09,368
it's about fifty k lines of code

1089
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:12,869
there's a breakdown of what those lines
are

1090
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:15,719
a lot of those lines are very easy to
that

1091
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,719
if you take the kodak

1092
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,969
the kodak and deals with this speech
when it's already d crypt it's a few

1093
00:54:22,969 --> 00:54:27,279
look at at that code from the standpoint
of does this touch anything but i think

1094
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:28,969
rooted voice

1095
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:32,140
does it right to any of the memory where
the key is stored or read for memory

1096
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,269
where the key is stored as you do
anything suspect

1097
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:37,719
at the kodak as a black box that just
deals

1098
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:40,489
with the speech it when it's already
decrypted

1099
00:54:40,489 --> 00:54:43,109
or but it's still d corrected

1100
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:45,759
there is no problem

1101
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,740
so please help us take a look

1102
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,099
look at some tiny piece of what we did

1103
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:53,799
there's a web address

1104
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:56,059
to download the source code

1105
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,629
as it says there were committed to
rapidly fixing it sits stuff is found

1106
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:04,759
we've we've really will try it within
days to fix what's found

1107
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:09,599
first give us a little bit of time give
us a week or two weeks to tell customers

1108
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,229
to make sure that we have our fix out
there that it's tested

1109
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:17,359
but please go after asparagus

1110
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,489
if you find in as severe security
problem

1111
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:21,999
you get a quick to farm

1112
00:55:21,999 --> 00:55:23,469
the severe meaning

1113
00:55:23,469 --> 00:55:28,839
it would potentially lead to call
content leaking out

1114
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:30,910
i've probably missed all over the last
question

1115
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,540
as probably relates a little bit but i'm
from the school of thought that says you

1116
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,399
can't build a secure system for insecure
subsystems

1117
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,469
so i'll

1118
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:43,699
why didn't you take the uh... attack
vector maybe

1119
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:47,659
producing a very minimal sort of
security protocol that's

1120
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:50,719
that's a underneath the application in
really restricted

1121
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:52,049
what all the phone could do

1122
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:56,489
if you really if you were going for
really really secure environment

1123
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,500
that's the approach had uh...

1124
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,209
we've looked at that we've looked at
that platforms that we could do that on

1125
00:56:02,209 --> 00:56:03,249
the thing is

1126
00:56:03,249 --> 00:56:08,109
the g_s_ an engine for one wouldn't be a
secure subsystem to begin with

1127
00:56:08,109 --> 00:56:10,930
and we weren't about to write to jess an
engine we do have

1128
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:14,049
what we think is is a very decent best
effort

1129
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:15,809
on a general purpose so s

1130
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:18,579
and we try to strip it as much as we can

1131
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:20,859
we want to be available for more
platforms

1132
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:24,359
we also want people to have something in
their pocket they can actually use

1133
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:28,719
that's telephone that still has an
address book

1134
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,579
you can't

1135
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:33,589
give people something that that they
can't use that it that is very

1136
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:37,578
as it dismal usury interface that
doesn't have anything graphic

1137
00:56:37,579 --> 00:56:40,329
you can't expect you'll random user to
use it

1138
00:56:40,329 --> 00:56:43,859
so it's always going to be a compromise
we felt

1139
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:46,769
but you have a good point you have a
very good point in and and my second

1140
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:50,519
question is about what kind of metric
whitney houston sort of measure

1141
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:53,259
are your ah...

1142
00:56:53,259 --> 00:56:55,509
uh... respect that were

1143
00:56:55,509 --> 00:56:58,599
how much they you happy security like
what it what is

1144
00:56:58,599 --> 00:56:59,619
what is

1145
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,909
what is your mentor for that

1146
00:57:01,909 --> 00:57:03,389
however measure that

1147
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:04,750
how much faith in every month

1148
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,029
alex faith you had in the city tonight

1149
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:12,099
you have a metric for that by measures
you're different

1150
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:15,769
uh... not really we we you were the best
crypto phone out there were two most

1151
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:19,489
trustworthy critical because people can
actually look at what happens inside

1152
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:23,859
and we spent a lot of time talking to a
lot of experts a lot of people that

1153
00:57:23,859 --> 00:57:25,419
are in this field

1154
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:27,609
and we've had them look at what we did

1155
00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:29,339
we try to make sure that that

1156
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:32,139
we did the best thing we could possibly
be doing

1157
00:57:32,139 --> 00:57:33,569
but no we don't have a

1158
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:39,709
among more formal way of looking at it

1159
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:43,339
quick question about the windowsclient
how did you get uh... to send data

1160
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:45,759
packets from i guess the regulars

1161
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,459
telephone wanted send data network

1162
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:54,769
how do you get packets from digit normal
telephone network to the g_s_a_ in

1163
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,799
calling from the jews into the normal
telephone that where he goes out over an

1164
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:00,288
analog modem if you call an analogue
line

1165
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:02,279
the provider handles that for you

1166
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:05,879
going back in your either need a special
daytime number

1167
00:58:05,879 --> 00:58:09,089
witcher provider can give you which is
then in dallas a secondary phone number

1168
00:58:09,089 --> 00:58:12,189
with that when people call did they get
a modem at the provider

1169
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:14,078
which puts it into the one ten

1170
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,239
which goes to your phone

1171
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:17,299
uh...

1172
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:23,199
it doesn't work

1173
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,489
stands so i guess a lot of cover some
governments might not be very pleased

1174
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:30,559
with the crypt the phone and and will
push fell close maybe into

1175
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,679
preventing these types of phone calls

1176
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:37,709
busy pc for telco to recognize that
crypto phone phone call and proper

1177
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:39,449
connection when it's the one

1178
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,839
yes they could

1179
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:45,799
they could either ab ago after unit to
unit data calls

1180
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:49,959
which is basically mobile they took all
that is both mobile origin edit and

1181
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,389
mobile terminated

1182
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:54,489
that is something that is basically only
trip to phones

1183
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,649
uh... there is a couple of other brands
that they would then also be blocking

1184
00:58:57,649 --> 00:58:58,489
that

1185
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:02,289
for instance if there was a suspect and
you want to force them

1186
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:06,319
to use binding cryptic communications
you could just turn off their their data

1187
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:12,509
calls at at some critical moment yes
that is possible

1188
00:59:12,509 --> 00:59:16,489
last question 'cause i've been told we
have to wrap it up uh...

1189
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:17,200
i was wondering

1190
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,549
why u

1191
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:20,500
one years the too

1192
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,669
uh...

1193
00:59:21,669 --> 00:59:23,740
the two q generation algorithms

1194
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,139
together and work

1195
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:28,999
it seems to me that that has the
potential touch the macomb less secure

1196
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:32,259
know it's it's it's not a potential
attack

1197
00:59:32,259 --> 00:59:33,640
we use them together

1198
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:38,520
to safeguard against uh... weaknesses
being found mostly in a house the time

1199
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,349
we make these decisions

1200
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:41,170
eighty s were

1201
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,249
was going through a shaky time

1202
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:46,959
uh... because there was mathematical
properties found in the way the s

1203
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,809
behaved and it was

1204
00:59:48,809 --> 00:59:52,839
many more rounds of the s a grip sharon
is working rounds

1205
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,558
and many more rounds of a s were
considered vulnerable

1206
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,719
that dad was designed for

1207
00:59:58,719 --> 00:59:59,999
so we figured

1208
00:59:59,999 --> 01:00:02,860
there might be more stuff found against
a yes we

1209
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,750
wanted to

1210
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,950
interleaved to encryption algorithms but
we use separate keys that are not

1211
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:11,969
mathematically related and we x or the
key streams of counter mode

1212
01:00:11,969 --> 01:00:13,019
so we not

1213
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:15,839
we're not opening ourselves up to any

1214
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:21,299
for her abilities that might come from
from these two somehow interweaving

1215
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:26,079
so where were actually as strong as as
as the the strongest one of the two

1216
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,249
you're saying that they're not not that
their

1217
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:32,390
that one of them may be insecure than
their them and made the mathematically

1218
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:37,199
related and uh... summarizing reusing to
said that did the keys that for those

1219
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,119
two regression algorithms are both
derived from that session key

1220
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,859
and these keys are not mathematically
risen related because we

1221
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:48,989
attended different bites before shine
the uh...

1222
01:00:48,989 --> 01:00:51,029
so-and-so

1223
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:58,029
the crypto the crypto world tells us
uh... this is not in any way and secure

1224
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:01,850
i guess that was it

1225
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:08,850
thank you very much

1226
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,619
that's excellent

1227
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:23,489
mike at the podium doesn't work

1228
01:01:23,489 --> 01:01:26,689
i think's run for coming all the way
from germany

1229
01:01:26,689 --> 01:01:28,719
became german ins

1230
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,900
holland germany whatever listen
unamerican

1231
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:39,419
park at regression part of germany ones
but whatever lesson

1232
01:01:39,419 --> 01:01:45,078
the world began in seventeen seventy-six
coincident president-elect on

1233
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:50,449
in this room in about an hour we all
have a special broadcast of off the hook

1234
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:53,809
it's all the electronico many gets uh...
put together

1235
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:54,389
uh... mates
