1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:09,570
missing

2
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,930
back

3
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:20,909
here is Adam

4
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,280
who's going atom smasher who's going to
talk about sling the corporate

5
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,819
litigation dragon

6
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,709
emerging the victor intellectual
property Cyrus

7
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:36,060
it's all yours thanks around for getting
up so early in the afternoon

8
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,869
arm I just came from

9
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,240
the talk in the other room corporations
attack and

10
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,140
I think that was if nothing else set a
good example love the fact that you can

11
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,060
make all the right moves in the game

12
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,049
and still lose arm when I'm gonna talk
about is probably a little bit more

13
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,289
upbeat and far as the intellectual
property aspect

14
00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:00,459
things go and its a good example love

15
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,479
when your opponent does all the wrong
things they can make you look really

16
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,310
damn good

17
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,280
and you can really pull one over on them
I a couple years ago

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,910
I decided to start an experiment to see
what happens by taking

19
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,319
a website a fortune 500 company

20
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,870
that I used to be employed by and
tacking on a dash selleck's

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,489
and a dot com to the name and putting up
a website

22
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:29,040
com and that that's why I'm gonna mostly
talk about today

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,828
I'm do law as a hobby but I'm

24
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:36,549
much to my wife's dismay I'm not a
lawyer and

25
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:41,299
I'm a.m. hacker and she deals with that
and also much to her dismay

26
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,139
I don't usually dress like this I dress
like a hacker so

27
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:49,680
now up to talk about what I was actually
doing here

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,730
is like I said it was an experiment

29
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,060
I didn't know what was gonna happen but
I did know that whatever I did

30
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,209
they were gonna get pissed off about it
and to try and make it stop through

31
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,329
legal channels

32
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:07,090
so what I did first was part of the game
plan was I knew that what I really

33
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,769
wanted

34
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,190
was company named Ash sucks dot com

35
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,780
I how many people in the room have
something along those lines that they're

36
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,620
running right now

37
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,620
some type bus sucks website anybody okay

38
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,379
arm and I knew that ultimately

39
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,500
what I wanted was CSX and that the
company is it not a household name but

40
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,940
they're about halfway down the list a
fortune 500 companies they mostly do

41
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,250
freight trains is CSX Transportation

42
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,459
and I knew what I ultimately wanted was
CSX

43
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,750
sucks dot com and I knew that in order
to manipulate the situation

44
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,100
to get that and have them be happy with
it

45
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,180
what I had to first do was set it up so
that they were not happy

46
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,449
and with the way I did that was I I
first set it up

47
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,150
as CSX diversity

48
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,669
dot com and basically that was just
through one of these big corporation

49
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:05,440
things where they

50
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,660
you know diversity this diversity that
mean we don't discriminate in

51
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,370
you know all the stuff that they like to
pat themselves on the back for doing so

52
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,090
I took that

53
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,668
and that became the website shortly
after putting the website up

54
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:25,669
I got my cease and desist letter and

55
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,860
basically that was them just saying that

56
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,840
they don't like the website and of
course

57
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,190
they demand that

58
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,229
I immediately shut down the website
transferred to them

59
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,090
take off all my pictures take off all my
contacts all that stuff that I had no

60
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,020
intention to doing

61
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,030
my response to the cease and desist
letter

62
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,770
was pretty short and sweet I

63
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,568
basically said fuck you Cilmi and

64
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,780
shortly after that they said okay we
well

65
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,360
om that point we went back and forth for
about a year cell

66
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,720
actually a little over a year with after
they

67
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,660
fired after they served me with a formal
complaint in federal court

68
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,410
and the formal complaint basically went
into all the details of

69
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,520
why I on allegedly

70
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,690
the complaint was based on trademark
infringement

71
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,969
and that was the with cornerstone of the
legitimate aspect of their complaint

72
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,430
however the complaint was written and
such a was so poorly

73
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,500
that they really did a good job of
painting themselves into a corner

74
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,800
where they were actually a lot of free
speech issues that were raised in the

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,410
complaint that had nothing whatsoever to
do with trademark infringement

76
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,700
and that was the big thing the

77
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,820
allowed me to look at it realize that
they had painted themselves into a

78
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,930
corner

79
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,760
and by filing suit against me what
they've actually accomplished then

80
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,900
was there was no way out for them

81
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,160
other than to negotiate on my terms

82
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,600
because any have competent judge and
most judges are have competent

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,990
at best would look at that complaint
that they filed

84
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,600
and laugh at it much as completely left
their ass offer

85
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,680
over it and so they knew that they
didn't want to go to court

86
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,820
they were just using it primarily to
threaten me

87
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,690
I knew that they didn't want to go to
court cuz they get laughed at

88
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,430
cell that set up the stage for me

89
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,180
to begin negotiating the contract with
them

90
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,580
on the web site which is now CSX sucks
dot com

91
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,750
that season Charlie essence Amex is an
x-ray

92
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,949
dash I ya know how to spell sucks

93
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,949
and dot com I am

94
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,350
I've posted the original version of the
agreement which is the agreement that

95
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,810
they submitted to me

96
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,470
and said here's the agreement would like
you to sign it and once you sign it will

97
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,540
drop the case against you

98
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,960
after year and a half in negotiations
we'll end up with quite a different

99
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,660
agreement

100
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,810
which is one that I happen to like a lot
more for several reasons and that's

101
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,410
gonna be

102
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,010
mostly what I'm gonna be talking about

103
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,250
I moms gonna go over the agreements

104
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,080
a pretty much point by point

105
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,419
going over what they originally wanted

106
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:34,010
and what I wound up getting

107
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:40,800
um without going into detail too much
detail

108
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,840
without going into too much detail of
the entire agreement

109
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,250
what I did here and this is available
also on the website is this is a

110
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,199
breakdown of side by side what they
originally wanted

111
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,199
and what they wound up getting in the
end and they each got at me and

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,699
I am the first two paragraphs

113
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,320
were pretty neutral the you know not the

114
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,389
we acknowledge that would bring sued
that this is what they wanted this is

115
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,949
what I want that

116
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,570
did stride types of things that aren't
particularly popular

117
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,530
partial towards either party they're
just things that a reasonable to agree

118
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,930
on

119
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,139
in any suit or in any settlement arm

120
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,699
so these are the things that I do kinda
skip over it

121
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:33,699
in the side by side comparison

122
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,870
K I let's get here

123
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,519
paragraph 2 but what they had originally
proposed

124
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,690
and of course doing this under the name
atom smasher

125
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,560
of course they filed they serve me with
papers and the FedEx package comes to

126
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,889
atom smasher

127
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:53,500
which is entertaining and and actually

128
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,490
the web server that was hosting at the
time

129
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:04,490
the who is the address was listed is 123
PST drive you next film New Jersey

130
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,810
and I can only assume that they sent a
FedEx package to that address to cover

131
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,829
their asses

132
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:15,040
on paragraph 2 of what they originally
asked for

133
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,230
it to smash it is not here by reserve
any rights to use the CSX diversity

134
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,009
domain name

135
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:24,199
for any purpose whatsoever now I knew
that part in mind

136
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:28,630
plan here was to get rid of CSX
diversity dot com

137
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,949
but to do it in a way so that their
asking me to get rid of it

138
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:36,310
and basically manipulate the situation

139
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,699
so that I can say well sure I'll get rid
of that

140
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:43,889
but I'm sure you're not gonna shutdown
my free speech rights

141
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:47,680
so would you have any problem if I do
CSX Sox dot com

142
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,699
and if I do it to that domain name then
we're not going to be infringing on any

143
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,639
are trademarks right

144
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,699
and that kinda forces them into a corner
where the half

145
00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:00,110
they're kinda stuck where they have to
say

146
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,139
no no we don't want to step on your for
your free speech rights that's not a we

147
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:06,279
just want to protect our trademark

148
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,360
and that sets the whole stage for doing
what I'm doing what I was doing here

149
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,910
which is set up the site so that they
are happy about it

150
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,779
and I just want them to be happy really

151
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:24,600
so the first to write the first draft
which is what they offered me

152
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,910
it says I'm not allowed to you CSX
diversity that's their trademark

153
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,999
okay fine what it wound up being and the
final draft

154
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:38,920
is we added we end with this is a
exactly the way it is in in the

155
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,040
agreement is accept that these and

156
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,179
so to smash it is not here by reserve
the rights to use the CSX diversity

157
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,399
domain name for any purpose whatsoever

158
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,100
and then we added accept that these
domain names

159
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,259
may be used next to the hit counter on
the CSX sucks dot com website

160
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,339
to state this includes hits to the
site's previous location CSX

161
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,519
diversity dot com and

162
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,889
my purpose in doing that was so that
after doing the switch

163
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:11,249
people could still find the site through
a search engine so if you go to Google

164
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:15,850
type in CSX diversity guess who still
comes up number one

165
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,230
min K that was part of the plan here

166
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,279
arm

167
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,610
Google what

168
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,839
if they were motivated they probably
could but apparently

169
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,989
in they don't have anyone that

170
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:36,449
well actually I talk to one of the guys
who was reefer was fired from their IT

171
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:37,170
department

172
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,889
he said they fired everybody cell it you
know typical fortune 500 company your

173
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:44,259
non-revenue position we're gonna fire
you

174
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,589
and no apparent hasn't occurred to them

175
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:54,589
take to Google Obama arm

176
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:59,459
okay a paragraph to yeah

177
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:04,410
which here

178
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,100
paragraph 2 yeah the original contract

179
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,499
talks about the effective date that
we're gonna switch over the domains

180
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,449
and what what domain names we can and
can't use that type thing

181
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:22,480
arm there is something missing from that

182
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,300
so what we added to it was CSX agrees
not to take a close any action that

183
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,389
would impair or interfere with smashes
ownership registration or maintenance

184
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:35,730
the CSX sucks dot com or the publication
of the website content

185
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,499
on CSX sucks dot com basically before we
headed these little words to the cut to

186
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:42,119
the agreement

187
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,629
that would have allowed them to

188
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:49,779
come back they could basically they were
saying well we're not gonna see for CSX

189
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:52,509
diversity dot com

190
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,279
and I kinda liden said well that's great
but as soon as we sign this agreement

191
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,649
you get CSX diversity dot com and that
still leaves the door open for you to

192
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,829
come back and selling for CSX sucks dot
com

193
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,889
that's not good so I had this added an

194
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:11,179
and that covered me again after was
flipped the switch

195
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:15,309
and change from CSX diversity to CSX
sucks

196
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:19,069
arm past

197
00:13:19,069 --> 00:13:22,389
paragraph 2g as at the effective date
the current disclaimer

198
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:26,980
located at the CSX diversity dot com
will be replaced with the disclaimer in

199
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,839
the forms Exhibit C

200
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,720
that Swiss state from the original draft
and the final draft both

201
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,410
when the entertaining thing about this
is

202
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,160
this is a disclaimer they're saying I
have to put up on the website

203
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,249
on the old website CSX diversity dot com

204
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:48,329
however within 48 hours a signing the
agreement

205
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:51,769
they get CSX diversity dot com

206
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,029
and the disclaimer doesn't have to go on
CSX sucks dot com

207
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:00,420
so what they're basically making me do
here is add a disclaimer

208
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,799
to add domain that's going to cease to
exist by the time anyone reads the

209
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,759
disclaimer

210
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,199
so I'm not going to object to that
that's not a problem to me

211
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:13,899
I am paragraph or they had originally
said

212
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:18,519
smasher shall not use any a CSX train
cSX's trade names

213
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:23,869
trade and service marks trade names and
service marks

214
00:14:23,869 --> 00:14:27,779
and I kinda thought that was a little
prohibitive so

215
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:32,009
what I wound up having added in there is
except the far up the following

216
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,079
CSX trademarks which may be used CSX

217
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,369
CSXT CSX technology CSX Transportation

218
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:43,829
and CSX corporation

219
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:49,639
me that's of top that it off topic for
the trademark infringement basically if

220
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,350
you go to the website you'll see why
there's such a great company to work for

221
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,559
om the question was what did they do to
me

222
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,899
arm and you know it's nothing personal
like I said this is an experiment

223
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:05,309
I wanna see what happens and

224
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:09,469
that's all and having done it I know
what happens

225
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,619
and I can talk about it

226
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:16,379
okay on paragraph 5 this is a neat
little

227
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,189
artistic thing it says the CSX Sox logo

228
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:25,748
which is my variation on their corporate
logo that I was using on the website

229
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:30,600
shall be altered InDesign an apparent to
be substantially similar

230
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,769
to the local annexed hereto as Exhibit D
basically

231
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:38,420
they had me come up with the about a
dozen or so different

232
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,470
logo's designs

233
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,899
and I had them pick the one that they
liked the most

234
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:49,730
and they said

235
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,119
will let you use that we don't feel that
that infringes on our trademark

236
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,670
but the way they worded it is kinda
artistically limiting since they say I

237
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,899
have to you something

238
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,109
that substantially similar to that and I
said well

239
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,619
know what if the year goes by and I want
to do something else that

240
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:10,239
doesn't infringe on their trademark but
maybe it's not substantially similar

241
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,290
to this particular example so we got
that changed

242
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,939
to you smasher will display a CS smasher
will

243
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:21,389
display a CSX sucks

244
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,389
logo on the CSX sucks dot com website

245
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:29,109
so I am obligated to display that logo

246
00:16:29,109 --> 00:16:32,529
that does not infringe on cSX's
trademark such

247
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:36,569
has a logo annexed hereto as Exhibit D

248
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:41,049
so basically instead of using that as a
constraining

249
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:44,420
example I can use that as just an
example

250
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,769
so whatever logo I have to put on their
does not have to be substantially

251
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:50,259
similar to anything

252
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,230
and of course with this agreement it's
going to be pretty hard for them to come

253
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,249
after me

254
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:57,899
even if something do you something that
does push to your

255
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:04,898
push the envelope a little bit on their
trademark

256
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,500
actually I can probably yeah what I
could probably screwed say that that

257
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,869
that logo is endorsed by CSX

258
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,140
and also I can probably point out that
under the agreement that I have with

259
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,610
them to

260
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,100
operate the website I'm obligated to
display that logo

261
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:29,100
on the website now

262
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,419
okay %uh some other some other pictures
I had I found amusing

263
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,430
they didn't on

264
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,740
one other things that I was not happy
with when I was with the company

265
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,320
was there treatment

266
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,210
I love different lawyers based on race
religion that sort of thing

267
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,360
on and I thought what better represented
the way that the company actually did

268
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,010
business

269
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,410
was a picture love some

270
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:11,490
the guys in klan outfits with
cross-burning in

271
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,630
recross in the background and the
caption under that

272
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,630
says cSX's you know a traditional
southern company with traditional

273
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,790
southern values

274
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,790
clip

275
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,639
and also a picture I love some chain
gang

276
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,970
crew %uh all-black che a slave trade a
chain gang for eighteen hundreds or sell

277
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,080
work

278
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,730
on building some railroad tracks and the
caption under that is

279
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,950
something likes CSX the employee is our
most valuable asset

280
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:47,290
they didn't like that

281
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:50,830
despite the fact that I really didn't

282
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,340
bear how much bearing to trademark
infringement to what they originally

283
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,350
proposed

284
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,320
was the photographs have the chain gang
in the Klu Klux Klan

285
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,020
shall be eliminated from the website
smasher will not use such photographs

286
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,550
or similar images on the CSX suck suck
on website norian

287
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,730
anyway with director indirect reference
to CSX

288
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,770
I didn't like that so we got rid of it

289
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,720
on those pictures are still on the
website today

290
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,450
and actually it was looking at the way
that

291
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,160
they filed the paperwork in the case
state

292
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,870
the way they complained about that was
probably the biggest bullet they put in

293
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,940
their own thought

294
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,950
because that was one of the most more
blatant things that had absolutely

295
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,730
nothing whatsoever to do with trademark
infringement

296
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,330
and they were still complaining about it

297
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,540
so that put the whole complaint in
question

298
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,379
on paragraph 739 nothing exciting

299
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,790
paragraph 10 now

300
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,240
this is an shit this is interesting for
whole lottery since it says

301
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,480
CSX will pay to smasher fill in the
blank

302
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,670
money the costs associated with the
acquisition and transfer of the CSX

303
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,950
diversity domain name

304
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,240
and basically the deal here was

305
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,740
I was gonna chance for everything to CSX
sucks dot com

306
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,840
give them CSX diversity dot com since
I'm no longer using it

307
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,389
they're gonna reimburse me for it com

308
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:31,160
not bad I especially considering I
bought the domains for 15 bucks and they

309
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,880
must have assumed a bottom for a lot
more money cuz they

310
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,860
offered me a hundred bucks per domain
name to sell the domains back to them

311
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,870
which I think they'll expire so if
anyone else wants to

312
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,500
rear renew those domain names and maybe
redirect them

313
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,730
I probably would get myself in trouble
for doing that but I don't know of

314
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,760
anyone else who would

315
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,460
especially if it's done in China cuba om
now

316
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,630
the also the original drafter this I
think they didn't do a good job

317
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,670
ascribing up their word document because

318
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,800
at the end of the paragraph there was a
little comment that says

319
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,120
do we really want to do this but by the
time across my desk

320
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,380
yeah they really wanted to do it now

321
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,390
the one thing that they I got everything
I wanted to this Agreement the one thing

322
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,950
that they didn't wanna bend on

323
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,320
was a confidentiality clause because the
one thing

324
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,600
if your fortune 500 company the one one
of the few things that'll make you look

325
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,180
dahmer then somebody running your

326
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,790
your company sucks dot com website is
having it publicly known

327
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,670
the you've entered into an agreement
with them that they're allowed to

328
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,930
operate that website

329
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,600
so there was a confidentiality clause
that they were hell-bent

330
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,230
on not touching

331
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,540
no matter what I want to do that
paragraph

332
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,120
they didn't want to do anything they
wanted that in there

333
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,080
and the final round in negotiations
which I had no idea was going to be the

334
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,949
final round into a came back signed

335
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,750
is when I look at this paragraph and I
said

336
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,400
this is a huge company delilah is suing
me three huge law firm

337
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,260
they're gonna send me a two hundred
dollar check that's gonna get lost in

338
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,730
the shuffle I just know it

339
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,060
and when it does I'm not gonna have any
recourse so they've got no motivation to

340
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,250
ever write me a check

341
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,020
so what are lined up editing adding in
here at the last minute

342
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,930
to CSX will pay smasher blanks on the
bank money the costs associated with the

343
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,960
acquisition and transfer the CSX

344
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,790
diversity on my name and we headed in
the event that CSX fails to pay any fees

345
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,670
02 at 02 smasher under this paragraph
within 30 days

346
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:51,420
the transfer date paragraph 13 if this
agreement will be void

347
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,360
the paragraph 13 by the way was the
confidentiality agreement

348
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,300
we'll get to that part up

349
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,440
paragraph 11 of what they originally
offered me

350
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,780
CSX releases industry are just smasher
for use

351
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,540
at the domain name CSX diversity dot com
which again

352
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,440
okay sorry as soon as we signed this
year's gonna sue me again for

353
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,990
and send me another cease and desist
letter for CSX sucks dot com that's no

354
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,210
fun

355
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:24,930
so here again on what we had in was a
more explicit release

356
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,240
for not just what I'm giving them but
what I'm keeping

357
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,630
cell they can't come back to me the day
after we sign off on this

358
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,980
and sue me again for CSX sucks dot com

359
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,870
arm see there was a paragraph missing

360
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,830
between 11 and 12 and

361
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,389
what I wanted to head in there was

362
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,050
this is kind of important the party
shall execute a stipulation of dismissal

363
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,180
of the action which basically means that
once I sign

364
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,640
you dropped the case against me the
original draft

365
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,040
they can overlook that and under the
original

366
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,180
agreement we could have all signed off
on it and they could have continued with

367
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,620
the lawsuit

368
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,900
which certainly didn't do me any good so
that was

369
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,350
very important to get that in there that
if we sign

370
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,810
you stop selling me

371
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,990
paragraph 12 nothing exciting

372
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:30,060
paragraph 13 is the fun stuff

373
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,580
it says none of the parties here too

374
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,860
me in them shell directly or indirectly

375
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,830
inform or issue any oral or written
statement to the press

376
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,020
that's all he'll

377
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:52,020
or on a Web site including CSX sucks dot
com

378
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,750
concerning the conduct of the parties
with respect to the matters mentioned in

379
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,810
this Agreement

380
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,850
this Agreement or any terms of this
Agreement

381
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:07,340
without the prior written approval of
all of the parties here too

382
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,530
nets basically a shot shut the hell up
close

383
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,780
meaning that if that stands

384
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,980
I'm not allowed to stand here and talk
about it I'm not allowed to publish the

385
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,000
agreement I'm not allowed to acknowledge
that there's agreement

386
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,480
and not allowed to discuss any specifics
of the agreement

387
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,980
now having thought a little bit ahead
with the part where they're gonna

388
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:34,980
reimburse me and suspecting that that
check was gonna get lost in the shuffle

389
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,240
we got this thrown out despite this
whole

390
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,430
paragraph became known void after 30
days went by and I didn't get my check

391
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,870
on its kinda fun to look at the letter
that I sent them

392
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,880
and this was after I about ninety days
went by I talk to

393
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,290
a lawyer who is handling this and I said

394
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,450
31 days went by is it can I call him on
it now

395
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:05,830
he said well 31 days you're kinda
pushing it they can still write you a

396
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:09,159
check a court might decide that they're
not really late they're just a little

397
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,130
bit late they can still hold you to it

398
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:15,490
he said he suggested I weighed about
ninety year a hundred or so days

399
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,460
which I did and what I did then

400
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,650
where they just wrote this letter sent
it in

401
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,450
to their attorneys and in regards to our
agreement concerning the CSX sucks dot

402
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,650
com website

403
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:35,820
CSX has failed to comply with its
obligations under paragraph 89

404
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:41,070
CSX letter in payment of fees I find
that CSX is failure to comply with cSX's

405
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,330
obligations under paragraph 9

406
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,230
relieves me have any obligation that I
may have otherwise been held to under

407
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,340
paragraph 13

408
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,550
since it appears that I'm under no
obligation to refrain from publicly

409
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,120
releasing this Agreement

410
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,800
I will be posting it in both its
original in final drafts

411
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,830

418
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,860
final paragraph if you believe that I am
NOT correct in my understanding of the

419
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,880
agreement

420
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,760

422
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,990
drafts up the agreement

423
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,080
before the 1st December 2002

424
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,540
please bring to my attention any fax or
relevant information

425
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,480
that I may have overlooked regarding my
intent to publish the agreement

426
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,440
I will refrain from publishing a prior
to the first November 2002

427
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,450
in order time to allow you to review any
relevant facts

428
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:02,070
and contact me and basically what I'm
doing here's cover my ass

429
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,790
by saying very simply I think you
screwed up

430
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,550
and I think your screw-up allows me to
do this

431
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,350
but just in case I'm wrong I'm gonna
give you time to explain to me

432
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,700
why I'm misunderstanding it

433
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,270
otherwise it's going to go ahead with
this their response

434
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:28,100
was it's your fault for not reminding us
to send you the check

435
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,310
for which they did send me promptly
after that

436
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:37,480
my response was to deposit the check and
post the agreements

437
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,530
to

438
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:45,260
with

439
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,910
not just in case like I said CSX they're
not a household name lot of people might

440
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,160
not have heard of them

441
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,160
probably most if you have not heard of
them on just

442
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,860
to point out sister just a

443
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,550
demonstrate how well connected how big a
company it is

444
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:07,090
just wanna go over a couple more things
before I take questions

445
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,990
just to demonstrate that said that they
are no joke at the company

446
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,060
and how many have you heard

447
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,790
love Carlyle Group okay most have you

448
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,070
no love them know the most if you
haven't just

449
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,530
think that I'm kinda like with they
kinda make Halliburton look like the

450
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,090
girl scouts

451
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:33,280
on at the time that I was doing and I
was having my fun with all this legalese

452
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,680
the former practice shortly after this
went down

453
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,410
the former head honcho a CSX corporation

454
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,930
on January 2003

455
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,580
was appointed by resident George Bush

456
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,600
to head d Treasury Department

457
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,780
the US Treasury Department so the guys
not

458
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,960
poorly connected and

459
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,600
connecting some dots here about a month
after that

460
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:13,830
press release there was a press release
from Carlyle Group

461
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,379
that they had purchased cSX's shipping
lines that other big boats

462
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:23,700
and that was for price is about three
hundred million dollars

463
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,230
now this went down for some this with a
press release came out about a month

464
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,230
after

465
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,910
this guy john snow was promoted to

466
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,820
head the Treasury Department there's not
too many promotions you can get when

467
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,470
you're the head honcho of a fortune 500
company but thats

468
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:41,400
one of them so month after he leaves

469
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,500
it becomes public knowledge that

470
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,710
CSX old of the shipping lines to Carlyle
Group for $300 million

471
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,740
and just over a year later

472
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,380
CSA are the Carlyle Group cells

473
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,610
cSX's shipping lines for $650 million
dollars

474
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:06,590
so somebody made out pretty good on this
deal but it sure wasn't the company or

475
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,440
the shareholders

476
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,110
might have been am NOT a conspiracy
theorist

477
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,600
so I'll leave this anyone else to pursue
on their own

478
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,980
but some might suspect

479
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,660
that the former head of ceil helped
Carlyle Group

480
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,710
make a 350 billion know it $350 million
dollar profit of the CSX lines

481
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,100
in my native been rewarded by heading
the Treasury Department that might have

482
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,950
been part of his compensation package

483
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,300
but I'm not a conspiracy there so I'm
not gonna suggest that that's what

484
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,920
actually happened

485
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,980
I'll to have any questions

486
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:51,980
about me this stuff

487
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,080
the question is how do I hide a libel as
a law suit for libel

488
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,210
and is there a fine line between parity
and

489
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,220
live off and this is definitely a fine
line between parity in libel

490
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,830
I am I'm not sure

491
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:18,860
it's something that they from day one

492
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,909
they've held over my head L

493
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:26,519
we're gonna see you for libel in
addition to trademark infringement in

494
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,429
addition to

495
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:31,169
making your life miserable we're gonna
see if reliable the problem

496
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:34,690
was suing somebody for libel is
discovery

497
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,529
if I say something that somebody doesn't
wanna hear

498
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:43,200
yes they can sue me for libel if it's

499
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,909
if the something that they said isn't
true they'll probably when

500
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:51,090
however if the something that I say is
true

501
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,899
and they just don't want to hear it what
that does is it opens up

502
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:57,960
the legal process of discovery me

503
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,409
which essentially means the shit the
short version is that s

504
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:05,299
I get to go through their books looking
for anything to substantiate my claim

505
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:10,760
cell if somebody post something on my
website aside from the fact that

506
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,379
I'm not posting and I disclaim
responsibility for what other people

507
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,630
post on my website

508
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:20,960
arm but other people post something on
my website that day would consider to be

509
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,970
liable

510
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,389
they consider to be libelous that would
allow

511
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:31,419
me in a lawsuit they sue me I can then
go through their records and

512
00:33:31,419 --> 00:33:32,789
substantiate that claim

513
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:37,559
up but it's a lot of bad press for
whoever initiates a libel lawsuit

514
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,580
because it

515
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,980
reeks earth free speech implications

516
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,519
and it's typically something that a
lotta companies are going to try to

517
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,340
avoid

518
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,309
especially if it's true its

519
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:55,820
when something is n even if it's
borderline true

520
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,720
they world avoid suing for libel but
they will

521
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,149
but they'll often threatened to sue for
libel

522
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:09,520
the fact that they haven't sued me
according to my own theory

523
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,790
substantiates the vocab what's posted
their

524
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:19,790
me from I am

525
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,149
the I'm not erase the fist it didn't
work out too well for him

526
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,388
as far as trying to disclaim the content
of this website but

527
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:43,629
with my understanding of his website was
that he was publishing the content

528
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:47,328
he wasn't operating a blog where other
people posted content

529
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:51,109
arm there was also a lot of stuff

530
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:54,710
where I mean that they screwed him
really hard arm

531
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,000
didn't completely out of proportion to
the website he was running at the way I

532
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,800
understand it

533
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,589
I am but for me the primary

534
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:07,240
draw to this website is the blog and I
figured

535
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,130
you know I used to work there I only
worked in one job position

536
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,180
actually two job positions and

537
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,060
really how much of a story can I tell
that's going to bring people to the

538
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,700
website

539
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,329
wears a fight operated as a blog other
people are gonna post other people are

540
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,109
going to vent

541
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:27,480
that's going to be a big draw a and
that's going to get people to the site

542
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,880
and that has worked that as as a form
and I recommend if anyone

543
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,880
does a any kinda sucks site that you
want to draw people to

544
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,780
I definitely recommend doing it is a
blog because all the other people out

545
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,650
there who hate

546
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,390
whatever it is you hate we're gonna have
a lot more stories than you

547
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:52,390
and you can post on there too i spose

548
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,650
yes a CSX was it was formed I think in
1980 there was a

549
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,750
merger other railroads primarily to
check the Chesapeake

550
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,830
and the Seaboard railroads and

551
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,529
it's funny that if you actually traced
back to history

552
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:25,030
never in the history of railroad
corporations is a history of Merck

553
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,230
corporate mergers income

554
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:29,950
and everyone getting buddy in goblin
each other up

555
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,830
and you can definitely go back through
the history

556
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,350
and find that at it to actually

557
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,630
one of the people I know who is a big
train fan

558
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:45,170
he looked at the picture I told him
where the picture was taken when the

559
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,340
picture was taken he said

560
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,030
you know what that person is in Virginia
in eighteen thirty something he says

561
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,800
you know what that probably is part of
cSX's railroad right now

562
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,500
and actually a few months after they
filed the suit against me

563
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,080
they had suit filed against them one of
two or three other companies

564
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,700
that were sued for slave reparations
their sued in civil court

565
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,340
for slave reparations and basically the
basis so that was that

566
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,300
the the fortunes amassed by the
corporations were built on the backs a

567
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,610
slaves that have never been

568
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:23,610
reimbursed properly as

569
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:29,000
it's not live with a be able to get me
on slander I think that the line they

570
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,890
rescinded

571
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,779
it's pretty much the same thing between
libel and slander on

572
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,580
my understanding other I'm not sure if
there's any lawyers in here's that libel

573
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,759
is basically the legal term for slander
but other than that I don't think

574
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,740
there's a difference

575
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:49,270
is slander spoken aloud okay so whatever
i doing a website is probably not

576
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,030
slander it's probably libel then

577
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,400
d if it were live less

578
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,400
okay what would I do if I were served
with a subpoena

579
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:09,150
excite what if I were served with a
subpoena to turn over

580
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,040
records %uh who is posting things from
where on

581
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,110
and also that get into another area
where I offer

582
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,970
free email address vanity email
addresses so if you want your name a CSX

583
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,170
sucks dot com

584
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,100
you can set that up people continue now
they're it'll forward to.

585
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,660
so you can receive mail anonymously
through the website and again

586
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,839
what if so what if I got a subpoena for
that on

587
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,880
first thing I do is pick up the phone
call the FF and

588
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,790
start figuring it out from there now
somebody said

589
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,170
if somebody posted something on there
like hey let's kill the president then

590
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,100
obviously within 24 hours I'm gonna have
secret service knocking on my door

591
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,900
they're gonna wanna know where that post
came from and if somebody's stupid

592
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,940
enough to post something like that on my
website

593
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,530
I'll be happy to turn over their IP
address and it's the becomes their

594
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,650
problem at that point I

595
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,060
now for other types of things like see

596
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,910
hypothetically let's say there's a trade
secret or something else

597
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,649
where they just come after me with
probably more likely a civil suit

598
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:15,320
and it would've I would have to judge it
on the merits of the complaint how was

599
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,440
written up how quick I'm gonna responder
house long gonna drag my feet

600
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,510
I am I could look at it they could
request that I give them all of my log

601
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,300
files

602
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,380
or they might just say we want to know
where this post came from or wait is

603
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,960
this e-mail address forward to

604
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,080
arm and then again it might depend on
the nature of what was posted

605
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:41,790
how whether I'm gonna drag my feet on it
or whether I'm gonna jump on it %uh San

606
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,980
Antonio again linking hypothetically

607
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,380
any website if you get a day somebody
post a death threat to the president in

608
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,340
the secret service comes knocking on
your door

609
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,190
I wouldn't recommend dragging your feet
I would recommend

610
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,680
giving them what they want in sending
them on their way on

611
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,129
now somebody says we want olive your
records worse as we want the specific

612
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:03,680
record

613
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,240
that's going to be a very relevant
factor and

614
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:14,150
also as far as I know I'm not under any
obligation to keep log files

615
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:17,450
after a certain amount of time on the
server

616
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,690
because a this site gets so much hits

617
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:26,020
I blasting away after every month I do
archive them off the server

618
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,620
but how far back I I go I probably
shouldn't mention publicly

619
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,460
um is that ok any plausible deniability
just in case I do get service for that

620
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,710
information

621
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,860
on but on the server insisted that
weblogs don't go back more than

622
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:45,860
any more than a calendar month

623
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,940
as a I haven't cut canopy turn dough

624
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,740
cannot be held accountable for turning
over stored electronic communication so

625
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,060
if somebody has an anonymous email
address with me

626
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,090
and somebody wants to tell you I i'm
assuming you're talking about on the

627
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,000
Patriot Act

628
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,040
where the FBI can request that
information without a warrant

629
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,430
or even if I'm snooping in somebody's
email

630
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:30,089
as of now I can stay open somebody's
email legally cause eye on the mail

631
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,830
server

632
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,200
that was that was ruled on

633
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,320
within the last couple weeks that

634
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:44,320
yes correct

635
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,750
yes

636
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,380
yes on his pointing out that there are
some types of information that I'm

637
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,370
obligated to turn over with the subpoena

638
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,630
and there some types of information I'm
obligated to turn over

639
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:21,280
only with the warrant signed by a judge
subpoena does not have to be signed by a

640
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,900
judge

641
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,580
om and how do I tell the line basically

642
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,960
I don't off the top of my head I'm not
sure which information

643
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,580
discovered by which rule again if I ever
do get served with any kinda paperwork

644
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,390
requesting that

645
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,410
pick up the phone call you thatthe and

646
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,980
have them help me out with that I am

647
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,150
what i'd one other things are with the
anonymous email

648
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:49,810
is as long as their male is being
delivered it's only sitting on the

649
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:53,350
server slot for as long as it takes for
Q now to deliver it so

650
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,529
the message isn't being parked on the
server its going into the server

651
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,640
going to their server and it's gone so

652
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,490
at thats to the extent to date i'd don't
have to worry about that

653
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,740
and of course I do use Inc TLS

654
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,420
human now on the server so falling down
now and inbound and outbound mail

655
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,310
is going to be encrypt it automatically
between hops

656
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:24,310
more questions no

657
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,100
with CSX had paid me on time what I've
had a backup plan for getting it for

658
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,880
getting out of it

659
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,770
on there's no backup plan for getting
under the agreement the agreement in its

660
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:41,970
final form I like

661
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:45,390
except for the confidentiality clause so
that's the only part I was trying to get

662
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:45,950
out of

663
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,620
I didn't have a backup plan for getting
out of it and

664
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:53,370
I was actually surprised that they had
let me slip n

665
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,049
the clause that they have 30 days to pay
me

666
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,920
with that said to me is that they didn't
read it before

667
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,340
signing the final draft because that was
done at the last minute we were working

668
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,770
on that paragraph

669
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:09,820
we're talking about them paying me we
had worked on that in a while

670
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,640
so I think they just kinda skipped over
it didn't notice it om

671
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,529
and i was just confident having dealt
with the company I was confident that

672
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,000
they don't pay things on time

673
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,540
and I know that that's gonna get
overlooked and I know that they park

674
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,370
promise to pay things within 30 days
it's not going to happen is

675
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:30,750
very confident that also they were
suppose there

676
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,650
when they send out the cease and desist
letter they sent copies to

677
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,660
the hosting company actually the guy
running the server who's the hosting

678
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,170
company

679
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,580
and they sent a cease-and-desist letters
to

680
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,310
the ISP's that we're hosting the name
servers 48 me a pretty much

681
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,320
anyone who might have any remote
involvement they sent out cease and

682
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,370
desist letter still

683
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:55,819
an attempt obviously and into attempt to
scare people into pressuring me to shut

684
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:56,330
it down

685
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:02,390
they were supposed to have after the
agreement they were supposed to have

686
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,580
sent letters out to all those people

687
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:10,160
apologizing and the final agreement has

688
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,960
this I think it has someone in the
former the latter the basically says we

689
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,120
apologize for sending out this letter
everything's been amicably resolved

690
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,500
you know don't worry about it and they
were also supposed to send me a less to

691
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,900
everyone that they sent it to even
though I knew

692
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,360
everyone who's with a sent it to you and

693
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,160
I pointed out in my letter to them point
why said that they were late in paying

694
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,640
me

695
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:37,370
I said that you're also in you've also
breached the contract by not satisfying

696
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,569
that you haven't sent out any letter C
you haven't sent me the lesson who you

697
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,090
originally sent the letter still

698
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,520
that one completely ignored they sent me
the check

699
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,030
but that to this day they have not yet
sent me a list of who got a cease and

700
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:50,930
desist letter

701
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:54,069
and they have not send out any apology
letters

702
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,210
so they're still to this day Cup

703
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:02,110
actively in breach of the agreement and
i was just confident that they were

704
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,140
gonna screw it up

705
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:10,140
and sure did you

706
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,118
ok if I was interested

707
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,239
I would pursue them on that but since I
know everyone who they sent a letter to

708
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:26,209
and since I've everyone who they sent a
letter to either on good terms with

709
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:26,890
where they're at

710
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:31,098
or they're at a business did it and it's
irrelevant at this point

711
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:34,880
so I'm that's not something that I'm
pursuing I'm just

712
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,640
letting them be in let been breached and

713
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,729
so I can brag about them still being in
breach two years later was questioned

714
00:46:42,729 --> 00:46:49,729
over here

715
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,390
I do have the exhibits actually the
exhibit ID that they were specifying

716
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,150
for the original other that does happen
to be the logo that still on the website

717
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:04,490
and black and white version of it here

718
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,740
which which I am obligated

719
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:12,349
apparently obligated to display and

720
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:15,760
summit the agreements Dr didn't
translate too well

721
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,839
into HTML so they're not available on
the website

722
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:23,869
but you do pretty much get the gist of
what they were going for their

723
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:27,289
I am and all the they're basically

724
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:34,289
just the same thing with different fonts
different colors I'm not sure what they

725
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:38,390
were getting what did they think they
were getting out of this Agreement

726
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:42,500
I think what they were trying to do

727
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,220
looking back on this they tried to scare
me with a cease and desist letter

728
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,920
that failed miserably then they tried to

729
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,569
scare me by filing a lawsuit against me
in federal court

730
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:57,329
that failed miserably and both those
steps I think

731
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:00,680
were just to shut its is judge for

732
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,078
the I think their goal was to have me
look at the situation and say

733
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,089
all Hong screw it I better to shut this
down given what they want om

734
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:12,538
and every step of the way to set screw
you give me more

735
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:16,309
on so I think

736
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:21,170
at the time now if they got the
agreement the way that they originally

737
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:21,930
did

738
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:24,990
and again I don't think they were
planning on having this bounce back and

739
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,460
forth over the course of the year

740
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,309
if they had the agreement signed the way
it was originally written

741
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:34,730
they would still have be able to sell me
for operating the new website they would

742
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:35,839
still be able to

743
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,900
file a cease and desist letter against
me they would still be able to harass me

744
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,529
through all different legal channels

745
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:46,450
and basically under the final agreement
they're not allowed to harass me as is

746
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,460
what it comes down to

747
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,760
is that they acknowledge that what I'm
doing is legitimate

748
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,470
they they specifically acknowledge that
it's a legitimate parity

749
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:59,210
and that they are not attempting to
infringe on MySpace free speech rights

750
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:03,869
so I think the agreement from the start

751
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:08,720
they were just kinda hoping I go along
with it just to get

752
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,410
this you get the lawsuit thrown out but

753
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:16,509
again want the way the law that they
filed the lawsuit wrote the complaint

754
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:20,160
I looked at it in

755
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,808
and left day prior I'm sure they looked
at it and said Oh shit

756
00:49:23,809 --> 00:49:28,559
and from there I just said all I have to
deal

757
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,059
is negotiate this on my terms because if
this goes before

758
00:49:32,059 --> 00:49:36,890
if this complaint goes before a judge
they're screwed

759
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,990
and by nan on and after

760
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:44,240
in a few weeks and months into this I
started thinking to myself

761
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,720
they must know this by now and the one
thing that they might have been able to

762
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,630
do at that point

763
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:54,480
would have been maybe two withdraw the
suit

764
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,829
year request to have the suit dismissed
at which point

765
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:01,730
I could have petitioned the court to
have it dismissed with prejudice

766
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,670
meaning that they can't submit the suit
again so

767
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,869
their stock in a situation where they
filed the suit

768
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:14,119
the suited is there's no there's little
substance little or no substance to the

769
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:14,640
suit

770
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,490
the only way out is to negotiate it and
they don't want to go before judge more

771
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:20,279
than I do.

772
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:24,799
so let's negotiate on my terms and if
that takes a year about an agreement

773
00:50:24,799 --> 00:50:25,890
back and forth

774
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:31,098
I've got that time

775
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:35,000
bomb thanks to the EFSF my out-of-pocket
expenses were quite minimal

776
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,099
on I think I had about four hundred
dollars

777
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:41,270
%uh out-of-pocket expenses which is
mostly research

778
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,329
they found me an excellent law firm

779
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:48,740
in San Francisco who handled the ball to
the work for me

780
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:53,789
and being that I'm somewhat overdue law
someone as a hobby

781
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:58,480
when I first touch base with the lawyer
who is working on the case

782
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,940
I said you know I still wanna have a
hands-on with this

783
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,630
so you you're the lawyer you're gonna be
signing the paperwork everything goes on

784
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,520
your letterhead

785
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,038
but I don't want to take a hands-off
approach to this

786
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,029
so don't do anything without letting me
know I'm gonna let you know how I want

787
00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:16,099
things to run here

788
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:18,730
and he had no problem with that at all
you know he didn't feel like I was

789
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,329
stepping honest house which was great

790
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:25,869
and together we had all this stuff
worked out

791
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:30,509
I'm sure some lawyers probably wouldn't
like somebody who's not a lawyer

792
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:34,069
thinking that they know one agreement
should say you know I'm sure there's a

793
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:35,770
lotta law firms out there

794
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,759
that the first thing they're gonna say
is they they gave me an agreement you

795
00:51:38,759 --> 00:51:40,369
better sign this quick

796
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:43,680
cuz you don't wanna you know you don't
want this to go to court

797
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,740
where's you know I explained to my guide
the way I was reading into it

798
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,950
acid I cuz I read through it it's it's
you know it's it's

799
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:55,630
funny stuff it's it's a bit early but it
is an English

800
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:00,289
and I read through and I said this is my
understanding other based on my

801
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:01,630
understanding other

802
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,200
they screwed himself already so let's
just go through

803
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,859
let's do it the way I want it done I am

804
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:12,650
and so that four hundred dollars half it
was the two hundred dollars they paid me

805
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:15,069
back for the domain names that I was

806
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:19,740
no longer wanted or needed her was using

807
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:26,740
I have time for one more question

808
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,160
do it as far as Carlyle Group goes that

809
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:40,450
probably of just too far off topic sell
it and it's just not something you know

810
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,609
as yet I'm not running Carlisle sucks
.org I

811
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:47,119
I'm not sure if anyone is but that's
just

812
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,559
not something that I've pursued not

813
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:52,839
thanks everybody for coming out
