1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,100
folder that extra mIRC I not tiles

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:09,110
and should only have one copy for each
version

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,129
fire zp installed its

4
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,400
Jim immediate access anything which is
that you need to not program just need

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,789
to do decision players

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,390
and have it sort of a different polymers
nice

7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,429
really easy to change its that's what's
up wat

8
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:30,619
spot these things just into the process

9
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,180
and click filed in the palms fun in the
process

10
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,489
and making sure that its starters and
anything else they haven't

11
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,219
caught that's still related to the bot
on

12
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,649
Joan take anything into the pot because
you never know if people hadn't

13
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:48,989
as a trojan he had been discovered a
mystery everything

14
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,600
119 on don't use but for chat not right
there sweeeet

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,000
is dead to you will use it for chatting
to Chris triple-a done it all before

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,109
its done horrible things to me sheens
home

17
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:06,240
and then so that those GT but the other
big golden bikini is St but which is

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,619
more or less the same thing

19
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:14,619
does pretty much the scenes stuff

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,210
all the old rules to keep

21
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,670
applied st and this is the demonstration
portion

22
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,270
had the slick demonstration

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,670
3 dimensions

24
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,209
get infected nice sons

25
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:05,209
who was working before

26
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:09,319
wasn't working now

27
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,849
so I am go with you into an imagination
journey

28
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:17,709
free you can pretend like you're seeing
this demonstration work

29
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,049
and what you'd see is

30
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,739
deeds on the screen here there would be
IRC channel

31
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,920
and it would be called like I like
hiking or something

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,319
and okay

33
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,299
anyway and then home over here in this
window

34
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,359
UNC everything Windows 2000 desktop

35
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,639
which looks perfectly normal except
thirty-year

36
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,489
file on the desktop called like cheeky
Potter

37
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,190
something like that and this

38
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,139
give a copy on this just up to you you
basically

39
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,810
you would click on the cheeky but
application to Disney image before we

40
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,160
know it flush out and nothing will
happen looked

41
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,530
the system manager you couldn't see
anything and then

42
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,940
few had speed of running you'd see a
buncha traffic going from that victim

43
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,319
to port 6667 on tires answer

44
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,319
which would be polite she

45
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,378
which unfortunately we've had stick to
it University

46
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:20,759
Jersey just so many sheen's you have
people that will look full time

47
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,860
for these kinda for these bought herds
and

48
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,000
dole hang out on channels a look for
hidden journals

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,190
on IRC servers stuff like that and then
bill

50
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,340
tried to get a list of all the IP
addresses

51
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,060
the clients that are on that channel but
a lot of times the IP's are hidden

52
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,409
so either they also used to like even
say he you

53
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,969
88 you've got this pack machinery or do
something about it or the I'll say this

54
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:48,840
is the IRC server every look for the
flows going to this r/c server if

55
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,940
your committee src sorry probably
infected and that's another way to track

56
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,479
it down

57
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,469
own their own home with things like
first which is like the

58
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:02,430
it sounds like the forensic and incident
response

59
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,500
team something is that

60
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,000
you need to pay them to be part of them
which is like good for old people that

61
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,139
work for corporations but not so good
for

62
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,349
people would have loved one year young
the mostly looking older

63
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:19,330
people like on their forties so if
you're into that kinda thing you should

64
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,609
definitely check them out I'm

65
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,080
also there's uni Saudi inches

66
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,020
kinda it's got a funny name for its
University

67
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,859
security officers group think and
sometimes you get botnet reports on

68
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,740
there but misleading

69
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,000
University people so we can assume that
they're lazy and Sinhala trim parts a

70
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,440
lot

71
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,550
I'm but the still occasionally come to
and

72
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,340
tell you that you've been hacked also
we'll tell you things like a there's a

73
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,949
Skeeter bite you should check it out

74
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,159
communications port or whatever user

75
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,289
really expensive piece of equipment
called a package here which looks at all

76
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,099
the packets

77
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:59,259
on your network and will do you should
have not

78
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,389
exactly trend analysis but it will do
things like

79
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,639
tell you who's been sending the most
files on IRC

80
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,300
or the column the top DCC talkers
usually few

81
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,069
iPhone University work the people who
like a big difference between

82
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,860
hacked people sending DCC trafficking
regular people so the

83
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,810
stick out like a sore thumb and high
traffic usually includes a

84
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,669
IRC bot in it may or may not be a Diaz

85
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:31,109
DDoS but heard but it could also be
people's treating movies and things like

86
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,529
that

87
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:35,630
for purses at the University the both
the same thing more or less but

88
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,899
it's not necessarily going to be but not
if that's what you're looking for

89
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:42,198
also you can move from shins not survive

90
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:46,250
RC traffic in march to the pier ICMP
traffic which indicates are talking with

91
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,660
YouTube here I ICMP attacks does
eliminated school in the bottom is

92
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,390
attacking

93
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,560
so we need to use a like of people who
use ours here are bad

94
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,990
and just look for all those people and
see if there's traffic and see who

95
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,190
they're talking to you when there's
intricate stitching

96
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,680
people or just ignore our see all
together and wait for your that were to

97
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,290
fall over

98
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,730
which is what we've adopted as your
policy

99
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,110
so to take my network please

100
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,180
own

101
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,750
so yeah I'm different ways depending how
you 1 I'm

102
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,130
manager network you can own

103
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:27,220
uses two different ways of finding a she
but general also if you're on IRC

104
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,770
you can tell if the entire team but mere
presence will have

105
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,800
usually some weird character combination
name it'll be like

106
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,490
x2 Museveni 50 967

107
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,790
and then go that's a button to get off
will join again in only its name will be

108
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,560
XTZ 59 60 and we'll keep kicking off
I'll keep you reading is number by one

109
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,329
and its uniting in the usually have to

110
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,520
like family IP address is coming from
but since they're everywhere

111
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,500
prolly change in usually do not as much
for public nuisance anymore because

112
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,579
people have figured out

113
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,990
you can set up their own IRC series
pretty easily so you don't have people

114
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,500
hanging out as much on dollar enough
metal it'll happen a lot then it makes

115
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,520
your car also

116
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,560
so this we do board online

117
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,160
it's like a internet which board we've
got like basically a number pad

118
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,930
regions like an IP address and use
things like warm virus never

119
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,709
on I haven't seen it like made
manufactured

120
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:34,660
mass now split if you're into reedy
boards the paranormal

121
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,920
and helping you psychically fine hack
machines does that

122
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,849
probably a regular review board we're
trying to do with the numbers

123
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,620
optimizing your way out too much take a
little longer

124
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,850
0 actually and if there's any like
really

125
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,970
did there's dead anything attackers act
that is

126
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,620
ESC admin X alive but then would he
really hope you for good or for evil

127
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,430
said yet similar discussions also

128
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,420
on you can look for DNS traffic which
known as talking about the problem

129
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,550
orphaned machines

130
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,329
people have gotten the fix that by using

131
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:13,089
dine DNS he's got din dins is it looks
like to me

132
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,870
am you look for traffic

133
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,939
going to time DNS host names that have

134
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,589
suspicious really obvious names like
packs or dot

135
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,730
Indians dot or evil dot Indians outward

136
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,809
and the reason for that is with the they
got the C&C methodology which is another

137
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:38,040
military term meaning
command-and-control

138
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,120
and world music military people come
into the hacking world

139
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,410
like let's bits and sure but anybody
other than that

140
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,819
issues like only it spitz region good
Shipley and things like that

141
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:53,839
but these people have decided definable
Camberley for us and what they've

142
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,279
decided to call this is a command
control methodology

143
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,760
and with that is your

144
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,319
IRC server is your your command in
control

145
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:08,640
she and so that's where everyone goes to
get commands and

146
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,850
control and normally

147
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,079
you configure year parts of her before
you redeploy it

148
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,040
you there's like options like uses
prolly menu option

149
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,589
that's like preferences options and you
go there and you say I want

150
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:27,050
everything to connect to evil dot
tendons that word

151
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,490
as my heirs user and the great thing

152
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,620
about dined yes is dynamic dns even
update the IP address any time you want

153
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,680
to

154
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,529
you go out in hugh in fact love machines
you make them you tell them to connect

155
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,270
to the host name instead by Pierre s

156
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,220
like evil dot dime de estar Lord

157
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,800
and then on if you're command control
machines ever found

158
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,350
it's not a big deal because you just
comprises a machine make that commanding

159
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,180
changing the update your

160
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,350
DNS record which I think updates on the
matter

161
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,430
like 12 minutes or something so it's
pretty easy

162
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,640
everything is become such a commodity
you know it is in terms of the zombie

163
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,959
and the

164
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,380
packed machines and the command control
machines that everything is very mobile

165
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,709
operation

166
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:18,699
very desert storm anything and

167
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,949
more military a things to

168
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:25,459
night ready to kiss a Daily Show but
they're backed up for like six months

169
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:29,250
since a live picture Johnston save but
what's

170
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,300
new in the last year isms

171
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,459
ago Barton fat but we're to missed

172
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,550
YouTube arts written by this German guy

173
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,520
I'm anybody who knows with his name was
is uses

174
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,069
and he brought these like super
efficient evil

175
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:49,730
network killing machines and being
arrested

176
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,000
in the east got arrested he stopped
doing tech support me stop doing tech

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,790
support

178
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,120
people really amazing I girls I want to
use this so it back to the old

179
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,010
goodies that have goodies but all these
which have documentation

180
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,559
usage statements GD part and AZT thought

181
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:09,399
and no at the time to anger but was like
the shit because people

182
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,480
was like slimmer but then it wasn't and
is really hard to

183
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,920
figure out what was going on with I do
but is basically a

184
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,040
is an IRC bot like any other IRC bot in
it

185
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,670
comes free with this can compromise
engine suspends in like fashion see

186
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,370
don't

187
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,179
need to

188
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:33,220
yellow card six other thing i think is

189
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,990
anyway so you don't have to go through
the trouble installing an module to

190
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,399
compromise

191
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,449
it to scanning income rise because it
comes with it to its

192
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:46,350
very much more appealing to the AOL user
who wants to be accounting

193
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,040
fat but used peer to peer to talk to
other

194
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,939
machines to the buyer see which is
another thing that confused

195
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,009
people who look for the certain things
you like but it doesn't use IRC happen

196
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,319
in the inner city but

197
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:01,519
uses peer to peer we don't know how to
regulate that's within

198
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,519
own the din all that stopped

199
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:07,850
when he got arrested I'm sure there's
people using it people who like wanna go

200
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,290
to the terrible thing you know but most
people don't

201
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,009
so and use old stuff University pitcher
Jon Stewart

202
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:20,040
and which is if you're seeing ring first
for peace talks is got naked womens

203
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,069
my answer to that fit you've got

204
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:27,399
also rx Potter Arbat which was another
like brand new but

205
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,620
which isn't very nice ago but that
probably also was not

206
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,829
as popular anymore just cuz it's very
ago but group ago but really

207
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:38,880
was good tax per guy he fix our problems
he was always

208
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,529
taking new suggestions for features
things like that and could

209
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:46,920
on the cool thing are by is it scans
really quickly

210
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,389
fast enough to know if something changes
by scanning it

211
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,850
and also this is perking up there called
La Brea like deliberate

212
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,560
markets where it will keep all the
connections open once you connect to it

213
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,589
is kinda like a honey pot was like
really sticky honey

214
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,130
and so if you're trying to scan machine
or scanner

215
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,180
like 1000 jeans at once your counting on
the connections close

216
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,319
enough memory in every band with their
ritually memory ins

217
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:16,250
CSU cycles and network stack space the
innkeeper

218
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,560
scanning more stuff with the breeders
keeps everything open and then

219
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,819
your scan takes forever like wasn't
returning

220
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:26,110
soon this follows Libreria by if you
text

221
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,329
too long a responsible chill threads and

222
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:34,220
so I guess that's kinda cool well I
don't know anybody who

223
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,110
use I'm sure people do and you do then

224
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,149
people for you haw a also

225
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:45,019
spam is another really irritating trend
you see a lot of people

226
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,120
paying spammers will pay hackers
breaking the machines which

227
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,579
now is really easy with make something
everywhere

228
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,180
just his PC peacekeeping everywhere but

229
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,540
you have spammers paying hackers to
break into machines and then saying

230
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,970
here's in three million copies of my via

231
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:04,589
out everybody and then the hackers will
use their

232
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,938
botnets for profit not necessarily good

233
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,389
and just since been to people's known we
see spambots

234
00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:16,329
on our network key its generally
probably going to be something else

235
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,750
compromise with an IRC bot to use if you
weren't looking at people there's an

236
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,240
online support 25 traffic

237
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,530
its sometimes way now to find RC by

238
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,610
plans we have URL's

239
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,149
for further reading where you can
download things like

240
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:36,790
shitty but St by on the

241
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,810
think it's link at the bottom like
weblinks orztech.com such spots

242
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,850
response to it you know has like three
thousand different kinds bart's

243
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:50,389
people were like 300 but its settling
archive workers back

244
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:54,500
a while and you got your different
variants and people are is

245
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:01,220
talking with things and uploading it it
is more cool stuff

246
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,270
admin those and drop speedy fine because
it's not people

247
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,429
and BNC

248
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:14,120
your own thing but yasser I for one
welcome our new about masters and

249
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,780
speedier James minsky

250
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,860
said that's that's the talk

251
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,860
see any questions or comments

252
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:34,800
stones

253
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,790
yes we do 0

254
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,170
it helps just yom's good stuff

255
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,810
not take down the network for people in
a shooting donor network without that

256
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,980
but now its oxygen bring the thing if
you don't have it

257
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:55,980
and family investor networking guys and
installing it

258
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,130
I don't it's enough to live off from
what I hear

259
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,559
ain't probably yeah I mean it

260
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,590
is the place in like free market thing
we're

261
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,110
the spammers knee-deep in less than what
no its parent pay the hackers

262
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,409
less than what they're making from spam
but it's probably like

263
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:24,409
dollars and his people that do make a
living off the grid

264
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,020
car owns definitely liberal arts Windows
machines

265
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,370
the sea as people have like now it
continues just kiddin

266
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,809
its ciskei taxes rootkits cuz those are
so much more skin

267
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:50,809
branded stuff that the Lord

268
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:07,480
hun

269
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,820
okay I'm think the large spot love scene
was

270
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,928
I haven't seen but approve it is but
something like

271
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:17,890
maybe a hundred thousand parts or
something like that I don't know about

272
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,080
the connection to organized crime

273
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,309
wouldn't be surprised wouldn't surprise
me if there wasn't a connection since

274
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,470
they're always organized crime is being
on using encryption that the evil

275
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,320
technologies

276
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,970
that the government doesn't want you to
use but could be

277
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:37,970
d went to the organist when people do
with the bud

278
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,090
yeah that's another good business final
the PIP

279
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,110
heating people paid to spend people or
people pay you not to attack them
