261
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,160
at least people's attention for a while
but at this stage

262
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,950
as for because is the source tears

very good where this this is

281
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,240
this program is not currently available
former

282

free considered

283
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,450
for years so

284
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:36,440
initially take there

285
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,299
its here

286
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:46,360
for period there

287
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,180
actually

288
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,900
there that

289
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,010
likes period did you know that yes

a usually text where

297
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:31,530
missus past the collision much more

298
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:35,129
it is process trickster

299
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,660
yes %uh there is

300
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,480
other

301
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,980
explores polls ditches

302
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:50,980
yet

303
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,799
busy there jerry is you

304
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:56,999
filter there's this this

00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,559
files lol

307
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,840
is passes

308
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,259
was easily to something else

309
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:15,219
is is

310
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:18,719
the dishes third in-house

311
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:22,299
years earlier to the

312

but is his third University orange

313
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:29,849
possibly over it later marches past

314
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:34,210
our it also remarkable for calls to

315
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,190
s Richard which

316
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,589
did there

317
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:46,559
yes it is it desperate heard

318
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,889
periods registry all this

319
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,090
heard is so their use

320
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,360
with a dissimilar

321
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,110
excellent sources whose click through it
actually

322
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:10,159
this blockbuster I would

323
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,590
actually is experts let's look at it
issues

324
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,149
stutter sister

325
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:22,140
our customers that

326
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:29,140
real worse

327
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,600
should

328
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,779
other uses technology clean differential

329
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:43,130
sis ways

330
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:50,130
whose

331
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,770
this with me

332
00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:00,520
is

333
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:06,929
which so his

00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:13,929
secured

335
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:26,990

here ability

342
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:26,520
the way

343
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,029
differential is

344
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:38,029
here

345
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:44,870
here here

346
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,210
basically

347
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,120
there's a lot of research

348
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,179
area there

349
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:59,789
there for

350
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:05,289
say

351
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:11,908
we're these

for

360
00:31:53,929 --> 00:32:00,929
process your with humor

361
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:10,230
our

362
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:17,230
way say his

363
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,120
me
