1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,390
this is a first route when you

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:10,379
hit in in China okay

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,200
and from there weekend to

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,440
last testings and 0

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,560
so if you have a if you can get a
computer in China

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,359
you can't test different kind of
packages

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,160
so I transit as TCP parts

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,949
and also I tried if the connection

9
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,449
if is by directional orders one
direction I mean

10
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:41,210
if forces blocked IP can I steal

11
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,069
send package to China can I get back to
back or containers

12
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:48,780
send packets you too to me but I cannot
sending

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,039
and you hi and with iPhone

14
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,679
as no no package you can go through the
either

15
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,899
directions and

16
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,639
second feature as their

17
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:06,210
landslide ease got blocked I

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,539
as Nate said we at Centennial see

19
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:14,770
they are something like thousand level

20
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,780
Eyed Peas clocked

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,439
related to our in and decide those

22
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,979
your stealing eyepiece for like the
venues

23
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:29,600
dot com you a dog or human rights in
China wet side

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,049
those ID's always locked that since

25
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,999
we we keep season nighties so they can
know have to

26
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:42,699
plan Raptors thats certain number of
ideas

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,939
and the search feature as let's

28
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,640
they have to a block those

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,020
Catholic out I'll huge number of venue
is

30
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,130
and by the end of last year's event is
18 gate this per second and that growing

31
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,960
that doubling every six months now is
probably

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,009
city six key it piece by per seconds

33
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,060
that in total and as we

34
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,519
we seeing the pp reas page

35
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,849
they are blocking and for throughout her

36
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,869
you and her China yeah

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,209
only a couple of such routers let's
thats

38
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,430
lots of benefits for each of those

39
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,959
routers so the question is

40
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,970
on who are doing is I mean with vendor

41
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,150
and what

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,069
was aidid's and how we can disable it

43
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,489
they are book meeting by using gotten

44
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,970
card losing new China I think that's
tight

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,220
and the he it out with some way Cisco

46
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,290
and he said siskel actually customer
eyes

47
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,140
their outer for China specifically for
the proposed

48
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,390
sensing in hella traffic I mean

49
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:12,390
the way china anne

50
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,670
so that's a IQ level blocking yet

51
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,100
for without in school what what i think
is probably they

52
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,319
do it like that Cisco router they have
the access to less

53
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,890
you can use this can acknowledges just
look at yes read

54
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,560
I ID address that can be

55
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,260
very high-performance scan and not
attack

56
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,190
traffic but for tttt Rutt

57
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,709
thats doesn't require more CPU and mem

58
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,070
sold we are you expand on separately

59
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,150
for DZD its

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,290
at first catch my attention being

61
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,739
2002 one on Google

62
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,830
first they got blocked by China and then

63
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,069
people found is redirect its sound

64
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,230
Chinese a change in and then after that

65
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,510
what happened years Jan you can steal
used Google

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,840
but they can now its search certain
keywords

67
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,890
so what's happening is whence you search
some kinda for beating keywords

68
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,669
your connection get it you lost your
connection

69
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,010
to go for fall I'll so

70
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,849
and to to study is as we

71
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,160
released at the scene we we started to
think it's something related to that

72
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,930
you I'll Google use and get massive

73
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,450
so your look you're you're searching as

74
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,680
attended to your

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,840
to who goes URL we

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,460
we tried to query a Chinese website

77
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,979
with stream attended and then

78
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,979
we also singer non from United States

79
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:10,190
so the key is you all spending package

80
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,289
me too go sousa

81
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:19,130
boundary between China and the rest of
the world and then we

82
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,760
miss tilly try to go further in

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,340
for TZT relation docking blankies

84
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,039
if you want to attract session a

85
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,260
we we want to try the simplest way we're
thinking maybe

86
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,669
they the only block based on a single
package

87
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:41,099
so we tried for the

88
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:46,919
for a CV tragic what you have is you
have get

89
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,490
space and slash and then your URL

90
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,289
so there's where that US can be found so

91
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,400
then we we try this

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,760
and we found out that indeed only a
single package

93
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,969
where's stop this GTE's space actions
and the keyword

94
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,530
than you have got we

95
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,159
we said package sorry if you doing

96
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,060
you I really visiting the website what
happened years

97
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,110
whens use and now they're get a repast
your TCP connection

98
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,200
we r we see reset package where's

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,370
although society I G parts

100
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,770
and sexist amber ABC's matched so

101
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,070
you are a connection with each year down
and moreover

102
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,380
this fall of parameters the sauce parts
of society

103
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,190
destination IP and destination parts the
Ohana

104
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,780
blacklist so from from that

105
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,140
if you send out the package without you
work

106
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,599
and yet you to the baggage steal you
work at

107
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,510
i reset so this is a lie when people
search some for bidding wars

108
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,460
and then they cannot connect to go for a
while and

109
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,440
neck seam yeah I I wish I but show you

110
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,700
here so I will need them to you

111
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,070
so the next thing the one thing I houses

112
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,409
census for any IT

113
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,210
any website or any unlike you can
service even

114
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,270
de Vries no computer live

115
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,680
the behind it. so there's

116
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,960
some might like not use in China so you
send a

117
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,919
the package get space a keyword and
steal you look at it he said package

118
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,380
back so we want to know who is sending
this week he said package

119
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,490
tool the trick is like what happened
with

120
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,550
trace out so you jesse i TTL

121
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,810
and I'm to their so

122
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,720
your package we are now to reach on the
way Tuesday

123
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,039
the local network I love that I P

124
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,300
user data or live and then

125
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,690
for you using the let trees our data we
just got

126
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,100
we found that's this the side he

127
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,280
lead is

128
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,560
okay GDL searching is what we need

129
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
so if you junior GGL 212

130
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,990
and send now searching for the package
you got you won't get anything

131
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,060
if you turn a 213 then you look at the
resale package

132
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,440
so everything is going everything going
on about

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,870
TCP session hijacking is related to it
these

134
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,980
router the handing somewhere around in
this router

135
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,980
the you that and so

136
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,370
you can see this is a so that first
browser is this year

137
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,300
in when you and China so this is a so
iraq

138
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,380
but this is kinda Hatton we with found

139
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,780
for this TCP session hijacking its

140
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,130
we risk and I when sound nike's

141
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,140
cowards every way China and

142
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,089
so they are mostly as second or so
throughout

143
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,339
you where you enter China the so here's

144
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,740
and and announcing work was mentioning
as

145
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,089
if you are sending your for beating
package

146
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:33,790
to a live web server then

147
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,790
its its she should send you that's life
web service to thank you

148
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,240
i reset because fewer without

149
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,839
TCP handshake you directly is ended

150
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,540
the webcast that if if you are doing
this to China with a key word in it

151
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,870
you will receive to reset package why is
from the web server

152
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,310
why is from this is kinda engine

153
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,940
so here the

154
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,380
the series behind the ears its is
scandalous

155
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,040
new free so it's still allow your
package to

156
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,219
go soo to reach be a web server that it
will get a cocky

157
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:20,220
and then tear down your xisbi
connections

158
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,540
so the more more about the

159
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,589
implication of this TCP session

160
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:32,970
hijacking the

161
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,790
so and here they only need to look as a

162
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,699
URL and also

163
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:46,689
notice at in what in value what what
happened for proxy server

164
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:50,259
his land one West website is blocked the
first

165
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:53,480
responses we can you say proxy server

166
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,790
proxy server outside China and access
other web sites

167
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,519
however for proxy request what you

168
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,899
the package cross a boundary of China
outside

169
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,100
as gets States Sgt

170
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,490
columns that slash and save you and you
start dot com

171
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,519
so if you UN use our company is

172
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,579
on the blacklist no proxy

173
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,079
outside China can be used to access you
a new site com

174
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,100
because your keyword is here so

175
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,899
people say I may be china is using proxy
102

176
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:32,850
block all IP of proxies

177
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,339
I I didn't see a anne's Twistys
technology

178
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:39,420
doing

179
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,579
doing their job and than their alcanza

180
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:46,350
observation from users they say all I
cannot get

181
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,529
on Google for 10 minutes

182
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:52,860
some people say oh my brother will crash

183
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,709
something like that so i think thats a
reason like this software

184
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:00,600
problem and some people say it's a
reports they can get get back on

185
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,620
Google again the my suggestions probably
use a

186
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,949
when it reboots Sagada different IP
phone dies P

187
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,819
so these new ideas is not on the
blacklist

188
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,660
out that aroused but says for the

189
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,819
actual implementation and sent I

190
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:23,540
and another way of his garage open to
discussing their

191
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,920
his players ideas products and to singer
sings

192
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,959
that that's a separate box so they can
just ok upset

193
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,430
the the box the site said the router

194
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,120
and send a copy of every package

195
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,879
to this box okay so

196
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,980
thats TTT next is

197
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:50,980
DS yes

198
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,690
and psych do you keep yes

199
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,730
that that's what what what you have have
so

200
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,900
either you need to use certain
encryption technology like

201
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,340
SSL says and a also

202
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,480
we actually using sound specialized

203
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,500
encryption so everything looks like a
CDP

204
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,050
tastic that encryption happen day

205
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,530
Insight said attacking their data

206
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,140
the reason for this is we wanted

207
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,170
to be able to use corporate networks
ANNs

208
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,040
many company as internet and I was happy

209
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,530
at those who the HTTP proxy and they do
not allow its

210
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,630
anything other than party a

211
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,060
yet right now we have some network %um
place at people

212
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,830
10 use so we know how to

213
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,940
get get there on its but steal it is

214
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,700
create some performance issue or
stability issue

215
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,110
farr's that so we hope we can disable

216
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,440
so for

217
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,190
DDS hijacking on first

218
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,500
is applied to Google and Jan

219
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,980
at sea and I'll September their son

220
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,150
news come out that yard some hot some
other higher

221
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,370
a high-profile web sites got said

222
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,690
got retracted so I

223
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,070
look at that and realize that their
doing

224
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,220
Miller what I observed at that time is

225
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,650
for statement on man like is that I'm

226
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,420
the the way to go so for

227
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,750
any were I try it like

228
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,750
CD in Surrey in China any of those

229
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,320
1070 I review a tiger you you get a but
was I D

230
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,410
and then

231
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,100
so some chilling China say okays things
my iced

232
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,070
a eyes fee that the answer from my eyes
peas

233
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,410
dying so about using dancer United
States so they try that

234
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,490
and still together bogus I T and then
some

235
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,630
my advance guys state right to Stanford

236
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,660
static it on two packages so is

237
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,969
and maybe 9 use two packages we found if
our Bowser

238
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,590
TTP to around the faster

239
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,740
so what will happen is along the road
network

240
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,910
and may be accidentally maybe as a way
to do it

241
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,079
related related to that same route

242
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,580
yes your DS query package

243
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,190
contents the key word back to a doctor
and you

244
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,580
hit now throughout way station 8 with
this

245
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,530
destination I T two any IT China if
you're doing this

246
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,530
from United States then you at get a

247
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,650
response with bogus I T so

248
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,949
this is also something you can't test

249
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,060
from the United States against sound

250
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,490
Eyed Peas neid in China and you can play
with

251
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,810
TTL check to find out which router

252
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:19,810
is is with it question

253
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,480
one in a case when you're doing it from
China

254
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,270
playing at the Aso a TD as Surrey United
States

255
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,270
yell when is cracked the other way

256
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,949
is wrong and the actual situation is
kinda

257
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,240
come cated dick ourselves tiny issue

258
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,990
in most cases there I cheap package

259
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:50,990
we'll come back for hours so anything
like I you at the Ford to use at died D

260
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,850
so next show a flash

261
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,850
expand died

262
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,059
idea just mentioned and and

263
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,589
more visual way so a some friends

264
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,990
have to make this demonstration

265
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,780
every so if you are in China and
carrying

266
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,619
again sorry United States and you have
to a passer outer

267
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,730
its somehow has some other things
probably

268
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,620
carry a black players so you will get
set I G backfires

269
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,870
and

270
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,380
if you are outside China and your

271
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,020
quoting dancer okay so

272
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,530
area saying the whole China got hijacked

273
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,200
Isaac tangerine without so if you I

274
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,890
in another country and so everything
goes fine however

275
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,020
II I brought this up again this year in
February because

276
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,860
very signs saying that they're going to
put a 0 who server

277
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,600
in China so when you a if you try to
carry this

278
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,200
do the answer you say oh I don't know
where can I

279
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,950
like ask about dot com sorry you want to
ask these

280
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,030
do sir however always

281
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,649
thing and if you if the if the route
surveys

282
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,220
inside China and you you you will pass

283
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,360
aroused again and you work gets

284
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,550
their righties so there are some
complications related to

285
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,860
DNS her iraqi and

286
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,980
unit sigo other details but its

287
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,410
mmm steel a for

288
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,420
for the for countries around China

289
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,559
there a chance that that they're going
to be a chance

290
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,730
they were pick up that's true server and
asked about say

291
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,480
the way down to go and Ang garter fake
ID

292
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,880
and so

293
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,370
more more about said implication of zits
hijacking

294
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,490
first is over dog and was 82

295
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,990
is they are matching where's kinda like
it

296
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,940
who damage with a la carte so anything

297
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,059
dot view 8 articles your guesses fake ID

298
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,510
then so we'll have in years

299
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,480
like Wenski what they have is US because
the the name

300
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,800
our network for Chinese excess thought
that site is called

301
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,600
attenuate so we we have some demand
content

302
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,750
the stream the word or DT Dhabi

303
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,919
something string the one-day put you at

304
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,919
onto their blacklist they were also
block

305
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:48,130
WWE doubt CT where dot com

306
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,140
so if anywhere

307
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,309
you leaving the word if you're acting as
package

308
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:58,550
happened to cross the boundary between
China and outside word

309
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,520
you'll get sake I P so that's over
blocking

310
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,660
I E I did sound search it

311
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,900
and about US so

312
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,860
this keyword block two thousand
different demands

313
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,320
and they alleged they change their

314
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,450
me deck list and some details for

315
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,980
Cup couple of times 2002 September

316
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,120
now view a dark alley is not blocked

317
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,540
I mean the domain name is not hijacked
at the ID's

318
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,418
steel blocked now the that you are the
latest

319
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,990
are more I'm mostly related

320
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,900
to Danny ware sense we used to

321
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,050
rely on domain name and keeps reaching

322
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,070
demand name two different IP's together
on Sat

323
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,960
I keep so now since they're doing that
the anti caking

324
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,100
so these need this kind of che

325
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,980
won't be a reliable way and

326
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,309
as I just mentioned you free sign puts
Russa

327
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:06,100
into China as there is possibility that
peeling

328
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,169
Thailand South Korea Union maybe

329
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,880
day they can access some not set

330
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,690
blacklisted okay

331
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,020
the and done difference in the area you
can

332
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,500
take it as your exercise at home

333
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,210
you can't that's because a complication
is that the as high iraqi

334
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,830
so if you you ok area your local

335
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,540
eyes peas again server is actually has
two a

336
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,970
go on medicare is a loose ever and

337
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,150
so it's kinda complicated its E

338
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,340
what kind of situation you will actually
a

339
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,770
finally have a package cross

340
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,010
the boundary so they're different
combinations wants

341
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,669
those to

342
00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:02,250
UK so they also either Kenzo

343
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,330
and internet censorship measures China
use

344
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,720
and so than them away as more like said
administrative

345
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,580
message so there were put pressure other
business

346
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,350
in China so when BB ex-employees Yahoo
China

347
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,330
lady sin Son petition saying that there
were

348
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,678
doing self-censorship and Remo any

349
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,480
illegal content. things like that and
then

350
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,470
technically the basically blog

351
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:40,470
they tried to sensor everything

352
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:47,109
okay so quick summary of was what I just
said

353
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:51,489
so China as develop

354
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:56,139
huge capability to sensor their
internets

355
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:59,589
traffic and they're putting lots of
people there

356
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:03,979
in their eyes organizes organizations
say

357
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:07,039
30,000 and so yet

358
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,940
but those people working for Cummins I
guess no blue

359
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,599
work hard so our small our small group

360
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,639
is able to a min 10 Danny Webb and
provide

361
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:22,629
so is to now cancelled silence

362
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:27,239
daily visitors and

363
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,269
so just now I mention TCD

364
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:35,089
to CB level Dean utte

365
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:40,849
and Aikido next and into move on to it
the other two layers

366
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:46,359
oh okay

367
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:53,359
so your that I think I

368
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:20,570
yeah I i don't have too much information
about that for the

369
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,689
technically and I'm starting in there

370
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,179
as a black box and they are there
raisers

371
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:31,480
three-part lands from using that and the
other lands

372
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,200
from great white and go potentially part
and

373
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,340
is saying that not not alien doing that

374
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,220
and also there they're kinda

375
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,389
some kinda network security fearing

376
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:49,070
China and there you can see also vendors

377
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,100
trying to sale the scandal product

378
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,759
to China that no I at any specific
information

379
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,179
yes back

380
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:03,859
about three or four slides ago there is
something about

381
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:08,999
technology where you send more than 20
messages

382
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:12,100
you with back purple slide

383
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,070
there it is any any communication
technology that reach more than 20

384
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,820
people quickly is censored well that's
true larry king

385
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:25,460
thousands and thousands for spam
messages from China because

386
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,059
a yet that's something I'm going to talk
more about

387
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:33,168
late Thomas the name focus out internet
censorship

388
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,600
as political information or anything

389
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,649
garments defined as the dick

390
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:46,649
now to really stand Net Nanny commercial
stand you building on a whole other

391
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:50,869
questions to the end

392
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:56,070
will there be more convenient okay okay
so every word is please order questions

393
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,570
at the end

394
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:03,570
will get to the presentation given a
chance to answer afterwards okay

395
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:08,179
so that now and into the sixties and as
you is

396
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:11,419
magic's using you're there you

397
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:15,070
in the movie foreseeing I'll

398
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,928
sky me marty's one show to you is

399
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:22,399
what the reality is %um Jordan field

400
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:26,090
on the after that you you can better
understanding

401
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,580
I'll what's those technologies are doing
and

402
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,949
then back to understand better what said

403
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,929
the illusion years so

404
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,470
as a one up our salaries

405
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,470
your me a controlled and try to compare

406
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,580
what's going on in china is what's going
on here for

407
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,439
need a controlling in China it's full
control

408
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,489
so for all the business

409
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:58,059
including foreign business trying to
enter China market

410
00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:02,599
so they have close control what what can
be reported

411
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,899
what cannot be reported for Internet yes

412
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:09,080
specific use that they cannot have
independent

413
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,980
part they can only karch from
traditional media and

414
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,249
for the on

415
00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:22,639
for what what what I just the technology
I talk about

416
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:25,950
is mostly blocking so May 12

417
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,269
stop the traffic and East fact

418
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:32,529
yes we are Taylor the internets kinda

419
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,039
appear as the way the they won't so you
can only see

420
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:40,119
nation same positive saying something
possibly

421
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,450
about the government's and also a he
fact does it.

422
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:49,309
II does business in China they were
activity

423
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:53,320
comply to theirs and so this is kinda

424
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,678
self-censorship and

425
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,099
then yes there another defect from the

426
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:04,450
this is docking and so its here

427
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:08,389
you want for the the picture here say a
big brother is watching

428
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:11,749
so someone want to remind you you watch

429
00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:16,369
by in China late the want you to know
because

430
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:19,769
they want to create self-censorship so
everybody

431
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:23,099
so like when where you are

432
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:26,309
in or like email

433
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:31,200
so if you have certain wars Union and
then you realize that you know can

434
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,399
those who this is simply example so he
is

435
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,499
very easy to know sensor here and also
for the

436
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:42,259
for men website forum on PBS

437
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:45,980
they were post their saying thats on

438
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,990
do not pose and using the gun and
doesn't like

439
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,039
something like that otherwise we'll be
in trouble so

440
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:56,419
over then No government is have strong
regulations

441
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:00,179
I ski and they are arkansan ways to

442
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:05,070
blocks their efforts to communicates
information coming like

443
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,689
and yes they are there

444
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,720
logging that some other information

445
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,299
locked and and they were try to chase
down please

446
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,710
doing that and and dozing you nation

447
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,269
that the going by others so this will
again to air

448
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:28,570
to raise more self-censorship

449
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,039
so go

450
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:35,259
much directly to the your in China so

451
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:39,029
a they are so people arrested for what
they're doing

452
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:43,700
I internet from the left to rise so

453
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,859
the Miss Manners webmaster so because he
House website

454

and allowing people to say something
about at the Moxie

455
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:56,539
down and crash in and so he was

456
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,769
arrested and is going there nato

457
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:04,190
what what but she did as she rolled
tacos

458
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,599
and posted on that internets and another

459
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,178
rather now articles and out a loud

460
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:14,710
the connotation and and very likely

461
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,009
nyse:t give out as I ski

462
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:23,089
gave out her Eyed Peas and his name is
able to

463
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:26,320
checker down so they are

464
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,869
for is kinda activity is there like

465
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,489
maybe hundreds of writers

466
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:36,519
famous on the internets though many of
them

467
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,799
got different kinds harassment or send
it to:

468
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,649
and the so the liars even more low-key

469
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:46,889
what she did is she

470
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:49,999
receive information related

471
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:53,659

and she was arrested just just for
theirs

474
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,519
so next step yes so for those people

475
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,529
who got into prism so

476
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:15,559

00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:34,379
reasons and touches rather common

482
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:38,070
especially for the so-called

483
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,399
conscience crime so you are charged

484
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,700
because up what do you think and

485
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,109
so thing about it is different from you

486
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:51,309
some ice tea or something and he got
caught sowie

487
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,200
say oh I didn't do it Rd may say oh and
sorry so

488
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,299
these do not charge me too much

489
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:03,629
but for this going so called prime crime
people where

490
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:07,179
many people away says sings it the way

491
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:10,700
i think is right so loss idea

492
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,289
and church where try to so dislike

493
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:17,609
their ma case of torch

494
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:21,369
for though those kind of so-called crime
so

495
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:25,700
yet very quickly pick up a few example

496
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,019
therefore for these land what happened
as

497
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:32,289
the peace now we r day

498
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:35,480
bamboo stick into finger and

499
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,989
so those two are people with a

500
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:43,919
be holding some confession can confine

501
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,309
small sale for extended time you know
weeks

502
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:51,440
and so I'd she's

503
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,940
not too much time motor next

504
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,159
so those are not individual

505
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,419
cases it happens there's throughout
China

506
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:05,569
in sings 1999 there

507
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:09,789
when when thousands confirmed case of

508
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,908
found on practitioners a died

509
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:16,250
in detention and so those are

510
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,359
you think about it those are some other

511
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,029
parts case resulted deaths and those are
information you can

512
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:27,099
get because of others censorship sold

513
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:31,470
action and patients should be larger and
its nationwide

514
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,019
and it has been going on up to now

515
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:38,899
and also according to those these men

516
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,929
its from order from high officials

517
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:46,730
and they have some hold each moms

518
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,069
during their also starch harming people

519
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,389
allowed to to it touched

520
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:57,599
to to die so some statistics

521
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,658
they are this is destitution across
different

522
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:05,220
problems Singh in time so you can see
its

523
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,060
everywhere and those are there members
you

524
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:14,969
that desk A's you can see is keeps
increasing

525
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,480
okay so the

526
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,639
continue little bit about my comment
about

527
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,099
conscious Klein so its is

528
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:30,379
different from like some crazy people
that have found

529
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:34,000
whereas touching people or they just fun
to to people

530
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,480
is convincing that the the Colossus
Torridge

531
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,799
keating as to change people's minds this
is attacked on

532
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:44,899
human space pitcher

533
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,989
Aditi and all those things are on
background

534
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:52,190
media control so from the beginning you

535
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,810
its hard for people 2k2

536
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,170
know that your information are those
cases

537
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:02,359
covered up in China

538
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:07,819
and also a whiz I was a

539
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:11,920
economic economic opportunities in China

540
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,200
and cell there there is

541
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,810
ways so china is getting cooperation
from

542
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,849
business seeing outside China like

543
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:26,779
Yahoo China K's there if you socially
optimal

544
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:30,529
forces and she was there is out is very
different from what you've got

545
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:34,040
who on Google alza information

546
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,140
Chinese government doesn't like to you
you

547
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,359
you cannot find it on who yeah I'll

548
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:47,359
Yahoo China's search engine

549
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,250
okay so the

550
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,750
I think all those things is the

551
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,930
should come to an end first

552
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,750
I think one more people being away all
tears

553
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,060
and when I think

554
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,690
important yes you aren't facilitates
information flow of

555
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,710
what's going on in China to hear

556
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,340
and also that inflow in in inside China

557
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,660
