1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,779
their electoral responsibilities is is
another question

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,790
yes sir with the No Center

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,990
information repository do you ever
believe there's a

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,269
need for anonymous information
submission

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:17,800
or should only the right people be able
to figure out who the actual submitter

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,519
I think everybody well there is a value
to anonymous sources that are

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,990
consistently proven right

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,420
arm I don't have any hard rules

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,970
are on balance I think being open about
who you are and what you've collected is

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,500
right because if you're if you're

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
if you're stealing information and
posting it that's not really I'll send

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,100
that's theft

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,320
arm and so I'm not looking to

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,130
inspire I mean I encourage
whistleblowing I encourage anonymous

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:48,930
whistleblowing

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,500
I encourage the reporting have any
violation by any corporation

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,020
above its responsibilities to its
stockholders to its clients to the

18
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,400
government and so forth I don't have

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:05,019
any hard and fast answers but on balance
I think that openly identifying yourself

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,610
with data that you touch is inevitably
going to make the system self-policing

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:17,610
K now with all the information that also
helps gather

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,170
with bleach all the keys to its and you
believe that those people

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,700
our secure enough to hold that
information and women I think you should

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,330
hold keys to it I think it should be
public intelligence

25
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,760
are you know actually 06 should be

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,400
completely public no scent is when you
all-cif is broadcast all centers what's

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,300
created for

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,380
for a person and obviously if major bank
wants to

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,460
wants to put a billion dollars of
investment into a specific

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,490
point in Indonesia they want to keep
that secret

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,290
until they've bought the land and cut
the deals and all that and so the OHS in

32
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,060
supporting

33
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,110
that is unclassified in the raw form

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,640
and proprietary in the senate for and 10
things we've talked about some Swedish

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,290
companies

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,119
is that it may be that you want to
release that to the public domain after

37
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,318
you've done your business

38
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,260
so the year adding to the pot arm this
is not about

39
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,649
keys this is not about control if
anything it's about bottom-up

40
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,920
bacteria like self

41
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,319
propagation networking and on the fly

42
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,480
discovery I mean I i I don't feel I'm
hittin right

43
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,410
to someone explain to me what is
question was you wanna add to that

44
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,670
I mean with the information that

45
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,910
07 does help gather now

46
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,900
there's gonna be valuable information to
it let me give you an example

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,910
let's let's say I have this vision it's
in my second book

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,310
I want you to be able to sit down and
type in your zip code and immediately

49
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,040
see a list

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,329
issues that are important to you
education water

51
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,220
whatever disease and then I want you to
be able to click on let's say

52
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,290
water and bomb and so for your zip code

53
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,099
it shows the past water disasters in
violations

54
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:13,730
and the current ones in the near future
for future to the extent that

55
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,099
that is being protected by anyone and
then you can click

56
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,010
and say see a map of water in your zip
code and then

57
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,000
all of a sudden you'll see a citizen who
is downstream factory who was just

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,730
reported an effluent discharge

59
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,620
and this is like near-real-time citizen
intelligence

60
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,540
and all this stuff rather than being
lost in to the bureaucracy

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,989
is open to you for the creation a public
intelligence

62
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,090
so it may be that based on that warning
a bunch you get together in OC meeting

63
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,730
and say hey let's have some undertake

64
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:47,080
a sample the water every week or every
day

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,340
are or where you see where I'm going
with this it's it's kind of like

66
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,800
and I don't wanna say this is original
to me i've I'm the one that's made the

67
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,599
transition from government to public
intelligence but appear

68
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,769
tell her to shut down I have the concept
of new spiritual

69
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,739
well said world brain a Howard bloom who
was here in New York

70
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:11,099
the Road global brain arm Pierre Libyan
France's written collective intelligence

71
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,330
Howard reingold is written smart mobs

72
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,219
arm Tom at Lee is written the TALF
democracy

73
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:21,779
a the subject to something like alcoa
intelligence can

74
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,580
make a better world for all of us to
live in I don't see all centers

75
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,460
as a restricted club I see it as a
process

76
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,830
love sharing and and informally

77
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,349
acting in assigning one of the reasons
we're never gonna beat terrorism with

78
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:37,240
the FBI

79
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,419
and and the Department of Homeland
Security's is there a command and

80
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:41,969
control hierarchy

81
00:04:41,969 --> 00:04:45,620
and you cannot do top-down up prevention

82
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,059
you have to do bottom-up are

83
00:04:49,059 --> 00:04:54,150
awareness and and surge II after 9/11 I
was interviewed by BBC

84
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,939
that I said he gonna happen again and I
said why not I said because the old

85
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,499
paradigm was be can see cuba

86
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:04,639
okay the new paradigm is kill the
asshole you're gonna die yourself and

87
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,740
maybe inside a large building

88
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,360
are business classes figured this out

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,650
okay I don't think we're gonna see
another hijacking of the kind that we

90
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,400
saw 911 now I'm worried about

91
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,860
the ease with you can put suitcases
loaded with explosives under these

92
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,619
planes and we still don't have the
Kevlar parts

93
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:25,650
in on all the planes and stuff so we'll
have more disasters

94
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,770
but I'll send is about a self-organizing

95
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,889
our community event wrist in the true
sense of the word

96
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,449
next person are you guys okay with these
questions

97
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,589
would you rather have more spy stories

98
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:47,189
spy stories alright you two guys you two
guys for questions and I will use a spy

99
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,169
stories

100
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:53,308
um I'm I really think that this is a
good idea however

101
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:56,349
I don't think that government would be
willing to

102
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:01,149
changeover especially with stuff like a

103
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:03,930
I don't care what government wants
that's what you want yeah I know it's

104
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,580
what we want but I mean like

105
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,649
get on with it the government wants us
to be

106
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:13,409
you know in prison basically with Supply
Co Intel pro where you know they

107
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:18,188
in dade ger the minute you get me 75
percent turnout at the polls I get you a

108
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,289
new government

109
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:22,800
yeah I understand that and but I think
that

110
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,229
most people are raid rather than willing

111
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,430
obviously 8338 your people here

112
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,270
aren't afraid we're we're trying to I
think people are less afraid than

113
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,490
apathetic

114
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,619
are the supreme court to my enormous
surprise has concluded that enemy

115
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,729
combatants get a right to a lawyer

116
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,659
arm this is good it took them too damn
long

117
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:48,938
ought to get to that had i been chief
justice an advisor to Chief Justice I

118
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,119
would have demanded that case the day it
happened

119
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:55,599
I mean Padilla shoulda had the supreme
court's interest from day one and it's a

120
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,210
disgrace that they didn't

121
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,419
arm look

122
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:03,729
one other really cool things about
american democracy

123
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:06,839
is the only get screwed as far as you
wanna be

124
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,319
okay are this country is apathetic

125
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,419
on and I think

126
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,359
the the democratic party's gonna rue the
day that they screwed Howard Dean

127
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
up because he was really developing
momentum

128
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,080
and he was getting people energized he
was getting new people into the process

129
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,938
arm a will take another 10 to 15 years

130
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,889
but you know what these guys can only
steal so much

131
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,860
before the rest of america notices and
if we have a combination of another and

132
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,569
Ron I mean look at the last two years

133
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:45,029
every major institution Americans failed
Congress failed to control the purse and

134
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,330
prevent war

135
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,119
are the media failed to report honestly
in turn down fully funded anti-war

136
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:54,939
infomercials fully funded informational

137
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:58,089
academia stinks by and large are

138
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:01,709
at least in my area of expertise in
foreign and national security

139
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:05,999
arm what

140
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:09,539
yes I agree with you we agree on this
the media is controlled

141
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:15,649
I agree with you but that's one of the
cool things about the Internet

142
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:18,819
alright later okay later

143
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,949
later please you're being disruptive arm

144
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,059
I the thugs are coming I up

145
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:29,169

personal attention

147
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,620
when we finish okay are

148
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,679
every institution has failed our
corporations

149
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,530
RR I mean and you know ninety-five
percent of Americans hard working on a

150
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,800
small business

151
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,530

japanese cold in Japan

155
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,459
that could not get through the blockade

156
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,130
and it became the world's largest covert
slush fund

157
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,130
for buying corruption worldwide and

158
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,380
reasonably is controlled out of Treasury
not at a CIA

159
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,770
arm bottom line for me

160
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,660
is is a Jonathan Schell has a right
Gandhi had it right

161
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,650
non-violent informed resistance wins
every time

162
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,300
you know jonathan shell has a great line
in his book he says violence is how the

163
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,660
few control the many

164
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,939
non-violent resistance is how the many
control the few

165
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,310
okay and so I advocate non-violent

166
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,250
former assistant we can take this
country back

167
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,500
and it starts with electoral electoral
reform

168
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,040
carries a damn fool for not making it
his number one issue

169
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,079
thank you very much okay next

170
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,670
this is more just to

171
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,360
comment I'm several years ago I was
helping a friend read a report

172
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,000
about arm %ah money laundering

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,210
and the topic came how do you get
communication from

174
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,310
to unconnected parties so that you could
lead to a gifting network from one

175
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,380
person to another and therefore

176
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,080
you know in exchange for something like
money or something the helices yeah

177
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,430
and a got to thinking about systems
alike

178
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,640
you know posting an eBay auction that
you're at it as their attic on things

179
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,550
like that

180
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,620
but real big thing that really came up
was what better way to communicate with

181
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,290
what a sleeper cells

182
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,319
then with spam i like it

183
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,890
a spam email message to be sent
thousands

184
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,310
fifty of them are you important targets
that's very good everyone else is going

185
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,460
to delete it and it I want outlook

186
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,930
and most fans we should let the guys
don't delete the spam

187
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,160
I love that we will yeah

188
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,480
our what we really need is anyone who
replies to spam

189
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,090
or also I like it but frankly they like
playboy

190
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,910
more are also began offering it as a
large division

191
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,260
federal agents whose wonderful job it is
to read

192
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,030
every spam there there are reasons there
is a let me tell you where the federal

193
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,370
government is focusing the federal
government is focusing on cuba

194
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,870
are your boat or airplane can now be

195
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,370
possessed without trial if you have a
chart cuba

196
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,780
on it and are suspected of being
interested in violating the embargo this

197
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,600
is a major

198
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,020
cover article in one of the yachting
magazines okay let's move on I love it

199
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,220
both have the ideas last question and
then I'll try and do some spy stories

200
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,110
high or answer questions about spying I
arm

201
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,560
I really like the idea social
intelligence

202
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,990
system are do you have a particular
vision for

203
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,070
I mean as far as I understand its in
data integration system and

204
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,080
a system that the last seven tries seven
standard seven issues to start with

205
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,850
okay are there any working prototypes
that we could take a little on

206
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,220
collective intelligence

207
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,670
one of the things I like about
collective intelligence is

208
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,110
some other concepts they're on on wisdom
the crowd knowledge management

209
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,050
validation and so on you can also go to
my website

210
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,360
read the oh said story which is inside
of the OSA portal

211
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,070
arm but it hasn't happened I think it's
about to happen

212
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:19,950
%uh ohs into meet up which only has

213
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,190
88 people signed up in 54 cities right
now

214
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:29,170
but is potentially huge are also sent
out meet up dot com is my best shot

215
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,370
trying to get people to self-organize
imagine what would happen if here in New

216
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,220
York City

217
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,490
OC dot meet up dot com created a water
committee

218
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,670
a fire committee law a

219
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,770
tunnel committee or whatever and then
got people from police intelligence

220
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,650
military intelligence

221
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,660
labor unions I mean these labor unions
can communicate with everybody in that

222
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,250
tunnel

223
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,810
you know and and so then self-organize
and so what kind of weekly report you

224
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,920
want to create for

225
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,650
water risks in New York what kinda
distance library what kind of

226
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,640
distance learning what kinda virtual
library I don't have the answer

227
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,910
I I think this is gonna be
self-organizing from the bottom up

228
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,980
and so I would say to you whatever
issues important to you

229
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,270
use a the Internet these collective
intelligence initiatives for instance

230
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,569
the collective intelligence weeki was
just opened

231
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,100
and it's already got 279 pages on and
you can you can

232
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,490
Google for Intel for collective
intelligence week you can just go to the

233
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,950
collective intelligence blog

234
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,920
don't look to me as a leader I'm a
provocateur

235
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,460
arm an agitator you guys are gonna have
to lead yourselves

236
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,920
K alright spy stories while

237
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,920
what kinda spy stories do you want

238
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:53,860
what's at

239
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,860
alright what he suppose most important
skill in spying is

240
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,360
listening

241
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,080
when he suppose the second most
important skill in spying is

242
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,620
typing

243
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,160
I am NOT James Bond

244
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,209
I've carried a gun arm but let me tell
you something for every hour

245
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,520
agent meeting you've got four hours a
typing and if you're handling a terrace

246
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,040
live you have to do what's called I said
he said transcription you're the only

247
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,030
one that can do them and that is a bitch

248
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,339
up because with the terrorist usually
end up having a forty eight-hour meeting

249
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,500
up because it's so hard to get in and
out and so you end up having to

250
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,710
transcribe it 48 hours over two to three
days

251
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,080
it is a real pain in the ass we didn't
have IBM's Voice thing

252
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,360
at the time this was back in the
mid-eighties

253
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,770
so listening and typing are the two most
important skills

254
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,329
now spying

255
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,780
consists love spotting assessing
recruiting handling and terminating

256
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:13,780
which means a cash settlement not
execution although we have terminated

257
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,090
with extreme prejudice

258
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:23,090
which to stand for murder arm I haven't
done it but basically spying in theory

259
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,760
in any given country you're supposed to
be looking for things that are really

260
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,110
important national security

261
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,150
that's not what actually happens are

262
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,579
across most of the world's even up to
today although today iraq is just

263
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,590
consuming everything

264
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,470
but across most of the world we've had
stations in Africa and elsewhere

265
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,190
primarily because that was the easiest
way to get a soviet to drink booze with

266
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:46,640
us

267
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,550
and soul spying has been mostly about
drinking with soviets

268
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,270
arm okay I'll tell you what you don't
ever wanna drink with the soviet

269
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,110
arm

270
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,810
I mean I never did it because it was so
disgusting

271
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,290
but the recommended protocol is to eat a
bar butter first

272
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:10,800
a I am works I'm told but it's not
something I want to do

273
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,810
I'd just rather get drunk and fall
asleep

274
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:20,460
%uh put but anyway that's the main
reason the clandestine service existed

275
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,660
to chase obviously didn't give a shit
about what was happening in africa

276
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,620
we didn't give a shit about who to and
and and these other ethnic divisions

277
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,860
are we didn't even give a shit about
internal policies

278
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,410
that were extremely corrupt and
committing genocide

279
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,579
I mean you know how can 18 genocides go
on in this world in the United States

280
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,680
public the United States Congress United
States

281
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,120
White House thinks it has other
priorities how can Lake Powell

282
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,160
in arizona go down by two hundred meters
and Las Vegas

283
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,689
is about to lose water talking about
selling the mall Himachal for to Los

284
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,540
Angeles

285
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,860
okay Las Vegas is gonna Berkman five to
seven years and be outta water

286
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,020
this is what I would call a real estate
disaster okay

287
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,929
on nobody's paying attention to this
actually I love the movie

288
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:14,230
decis movie climate change I've invited
them to speak at my next conference

289
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,300
arm we're really not serious about

290
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,879
not only global warming the global
freezing we're not serious about

291
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,449
controlling bacteria

292
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,140
all we are going to have plagues in the
United States

293
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,580
we are going to have a lot of these
these troubles

294
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,770
on so spying spotting is you're supposed
to kind of say okay let's say

295
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,150
I wanna penetrate the new york city
mayors office

296
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,730
arm first thing I want to do is figure
out who works there

297
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,740
and i wanna figure out who the key
people are who are the key communicators

298
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,520
handle every piece a paper that goes
into the mayor who's a scheduler

299
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,620
arm who the people's vulnerability since
eat a lot of homework and these people

300
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,740
are and you a recruiter called axis
agents

301
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,080
soul let's say you want to get into the
mayor's office maybe you start with

302
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,649
getting there

303
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,650
really great looking blonde that's
covering the mayor's office for the New

304
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,410
York Times

305
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:13,140
actually they're prolly to well-paid for
some ragged you know how someone could

306
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,820
use an extra thousand bucks a month

307
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,260
and he said looking arm false

308
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,090
this is called false flagging say I i
represent a major corporation is trying

309
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,340
to get a contract with the city at like
your help in understanding the mayor

310
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,909
okay that's how it starts and once they
get used two thousand bucks a month

311
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,980
and your real nice to them and you know
they they they get used to committing

312
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,530
treason

313
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,060
and and i think thats

314
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,169
thats how we do it and so spotting
assessing

315
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:46,370
recruiting recruiting is basically
dressing it up

316
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,870
a in a way that's acceptable to them you
understand the person well enough so you

317
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,679
can make a pitch that they'll accept

318
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,679
arm and most people can accept money in
return for betraying an employer

319
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,230
by March especially if you make them
think

320
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,840
that is being done in a way that doesn't
actually conflict with their own ideals

321
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,159
and

322
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,890
and what not this is why we like false
flag so much arm

323
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,150
or what I call commercial recruitments

324
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,460
arm and then handling in theory

325
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,320
handling includes asking the right
questions

326
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,879
getting to and from meetings without
being seen on

327
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,970
various sources and methods for

328
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,920
capturing their information in a way
that it can be destroyed if you're

329
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,590
rested

330
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,620
one of the problems with CIA is it's
it's lazy about security

331
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,500
are its case officers don't live cover
they live immunity

332
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,710
they all carry diplomatic passports so
that

333
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,600
the worst that will happen to miss the
be thrown out of the country

334
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,520
occasionally they'll get

335
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,900
beat-up in russia they like to be to
some first

336
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,000
arm and

337
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
you use these people use access a chance
to put in technical devices

338
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,040
arm for example in the overhead
Minister's Office

339
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,060
arm or in the back seat of his car when
it's

340
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,840
at a service station are but a lot is
technical stuff doesn't work

341
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,590
you have what's called a path loss
distance about a hundred meters 200

342
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,720
meters and if you can't get out be on
that path loss distance you start to

343
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,500
lose

344
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,690
you tactical however because fiber and
all these other things are an essay is

345
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,310
starting to go death

346
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,899
so close in remote is getting popular
arm

347
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,010
which is to say putting stuff and to
specific tactical locations

348
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,370
are so that you can capture the
unencrypted a conversation before it

349
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,280
goes into an encryption system

350
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,389
on that's very labor intensive

351
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,679
it's a lot easier to read newspapers

352
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,640
and and one of the things that I've
discovered is a pattern analysis from

353
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,760
all sent

354
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,860
beats the crap outta classified
intelligence tell your real story where

355
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,060
I took on the entire intelligence
community

356
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,540
it's not a spy story but it has some
lessons

357
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:07,060
on the 5th of August 1995 I think it was

358
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,450
the the aspin brown Commission

359
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,300
had four witnesses on open source
intelligence one of my classmates from

360
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,760
Harvard intelligence policy course fills
Provost macneil

361
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,679
got me in which was a surprise on tony
lake testified and I think he says

362
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,260
he said something like I call my friends
at Harvard whatever

363
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,520
arm the rand corporation testified and
they said the Internet has everything

364
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,200
you need to know no sin we know how to
get it

365
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,730
this is back in 94 95 arm

366
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,520
and David Sarnoff lab at princeton which
is partially funded by the National

367
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,270
Reconnaissance Office came and said we
don't know what does

368
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,668
is but high definition TV will make it
better

369
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:52,110
okay that was their pet rock that year
are and then I came and I said remiss in

370
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,250
eighty percent of what we need to now

371
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,540
and I made enough of an impression on
the members of the Commission

372
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,520
so the General Allen asked me the other
day if I'd be willing to take on the

373
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,370
entire US intelligence community

374
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,980
in a benchmark exercises china problem

375
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,600
and so he turned a bit sizes 5 o'clock I
was actually on my way to Def Con

376
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,480
to speak are and Eterna Brett Snyder

377
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,380
who I think will be a future leader of
the intelligence community he's the only

378
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,370
guy is one of two people it served on
both the church committee in the ass

379
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,580
brown Commission and he was staff
director and if I were to be put into a

380
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,470
position of power today the first person
I would call spread

381
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,780
all he knows his stuff arm

382
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,610
but anyway said brandy its 5 o'clock on
a Thursday afternoon by ten o'clock on

383
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,450
Monday the Fed Ex delivery time

384
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,720
let's have everything the US
intelligence community has every image

385
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,830
every signal

386
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,139
every clandestine report wherever
they've got

387
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,140
and then he turned to me says do what
you do at the time I had an assist and I

388
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,659
called her from the car

389
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:57,620
and dirt older where to send five faxes
and then she said the six packs with the

390
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,980
phone number to me

391
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,150
and so on Friday the day before my
speech in Def Con I spent the day

392
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,880
twisting

393
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,890
455 CEO's arms into giving me a hundred
thousand bucks for the free support

394
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,270
by ten o'clock on Monday morning
LexisNexis identified the top ten

395
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,040
journalists in the world reporting
number on the rhonda based on their

396
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,980
byline

397
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,650
all of them immediately available for
debriefing journalists only published 10

398
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,919
percent what they now

399
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,230
and the best stuff that they knows the
buyer graphics the corruption

400
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,929
all the personality and networking and
contacting details

401
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,120
from the Institute for Scientific
Information Philadelphia the top 100

402
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,550
people in the world

403
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:38,770
writing reputable academic articles and
foreign affairs and other articles about

404
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,190
branding rhonda

405
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:43,850
from Oxford analytica in England which
is run by David Young who worked with

406
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,760
kissing on the national security council
attended Oxford

407
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,110
his harness Oxford University's little
many think tank

408
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:54,820
from them I got twenty two-page a
executive summary suitable for president

409
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,139
or prime minister on live around here on
the world portent

410
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,340
in terms of geopolitical references at
the US State Department trying to avoid

411
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,730
coming to grips with

412
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,370
are from issue publications 100 percent
a brandy

413
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:10,950
in 150 combat charts from Russia

414
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,610
all which we don't we don't have maps
for ninety percent of the world

415
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,900
okay we do not have maps below 100

416
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,500
hundred thousand two hundred fifty
thousand level for ninety percent of the

417
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,530
world and it turns out

418
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,700
it's the ninety percent were all the bad
stuff happens okay

419
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,919
arm and then belatedly from

420
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,520
up I'll from Jane's one paragraph
summaries every article that ever

421
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,190
written

422
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,210
on bronte in the military situation
there and then for me they went out and

423
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,210
created one

424
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,440
page orders a battle for the tribe's at
a time when see I was still counting

425
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,110
just the

426
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:47,570
the uniform army and brandy are and then
belatedly

427
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,500
from spot a much 100 percent a brandy
cloud free lesson three years old

428
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,950
already in the archives

429
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,679
and therefore an expensive CIA had one
of those cute little maps

430
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,750
and a regional economic study in the
chapter from the world Factbook

431
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,120
no shit okay

432
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,370
it was no contest we weren't paying
attention

433
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:13,470
arm that story repeats itself every
single day today

434
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,950
whether it's genocide or water disease
whatever now I I don't you think

435
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,230
compassion CIA because the analysts I
just a press release

436
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,360
that was critical senator Roberts recent
findings I think that he bashed the

437
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,800
analyst too much and he didn't bash the
clandestine service enough

438
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,149
he also completely overlook the fact
that see I can't process everything it

439
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:31,929
knows

440
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:35,480
are he overlooked the fact that they're
not doing open sources

441
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,770
are you overlook the fact that DOD
controls three of the national agencies

442
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,560
are which are completely disrespectful
the CI's guidance

443
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,928
and several other things arm that's a
real-world comparison

444
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:53,159
a fifty billion dollars for sis 502
million

445
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,350
are in gross annual operating costs

446
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:02,679
arm I can generally beat the crap outta
anybody within 48 to 72 hours for under

447
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,210
ten thousand dollars

448
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,899
arm I've perfected this is an art form

449
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:12,139
okay spy stories I had to carry a gun in
El Salvador that's not very usual

450
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:16,169
I used to teach a rules of engagement
from my battalion it's a long complex

451
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:18,750
processes when and how you can kill
people

452
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,080
are with specific reference to innocent
civilians

453
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,070
and my chief the station handed me my
nine military bases you

454
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,520
use this when you don't really care
about losing your job

455
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,310
understood that one that was my rules of
engagement

456
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:40,330
for combat in El Salvador on someone
asked me a question

457
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,649
yessir spy story questions now

458
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:48,490
move away from us okay arm this might
sound like an inappropriate question but

459
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm not I'm gonna frame nothing's an
appropriate here as long as its brief

460
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,460
it is um could you talk a little bit
either whether you had direct

461
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,560
involvement or just the history you now

462
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,990
love really badly botched her badly
conceived

463
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,530
CIA operations most wish that have come
from

464
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,700
policies of politics at the very high up
Sharma Central America

465
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,600
or and then we can go on to Afghanistan
in Iraq arm

466
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,230
you know I I am one of the un-indicted
members at the Central American Task

467
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,260
Force

468
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,570
arm I was to junior to really be engaged
in drug running money laundering and

469
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,439
murder

470
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,159
arm but there's a wonderful book by John
parry called lost history

471
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:34,940
and what he's talking about is is all
the bad stuff that came out a set amount

472
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,940
also vietnam I mean george allen has
written a book on vietnam call Tom

473
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,880
none so blind and the basic thing is
it's about cooking the books in saigon

474
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,880
and and ignoring the truth in washington

475
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,740
I don't think we need a Warren Central
America I think we have really miss

476
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,919
understood the power food and water I
think we should lift the cuban embargo

477
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:56,750
in flooded with the Internet

478
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,770
okay I it's just flat out stupid

479
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:05,679
to have an embargo on cuba it's the last
clean beach in the Western Hemisphere

480
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
okay I want that beach

481
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,389
a II yessir

482
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,740
compliments I'm it's almost like tenure
system

483
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,919
people don't well hang out headlight

484
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,130
I haven't really answered your question
what was it I'll

485
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,830
look after vietnam in fact as a result
to vietnam we learned how to run drugs

486
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,030
and launder money

487
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:37,340
K vietnam taught a whole bunch a case of
just how to be bad boys and girls

488
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,250
are we repeated that experience and and
are

489
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,030
in Central America only we use Southern
Air Transport and let them make the

490
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,590
money by running drugs

491
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,179
aren't we funded contras who turned out
to be

492
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,000
really murderous corrupt assholes arm

493
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,630
and I don't think we needed that work
you know if we would spend half the

494
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,919
money we spend supporting people

495
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,100
on peace ops I think we get a lot
further

496
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,060
now Afghanistan nobody thought through
the implications

497
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,710
alls creating a global Islamic Jihad

498
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,210
are I will tell you CIA did not find bin
Laden he had his own funding from Saudi

499
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,740
Arabia and in fact they were

500
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,620
major frictions between the Arab
jihadists and the legitimate

501
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,260
Afghanistan military and no pierde Jack
diviner both friends of mine

502
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,899
on and I think we really fail to think
through

503
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:36,310
what it would mean for russia to lose
control over the central

504
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,610
asians front now there are six fronts

505
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,220
that are in play now arm Central Asia

506
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,610
where Pakistan's government is actively
exporting terrorism

507
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,970
saudi Arabia's actively are tolerating

508
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,270
terrorism as as a price for stability
which is false

509
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,450
simply a central asian if western Africa
which is mostly muscle

510
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,409
you've got the Pacific RAM running down
from southern Thailand through Malaysia

511
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:05,010
Malaysia is a successful muslim state

512
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,040
it's a model we should be point on some
money into Malaysia

513
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,770
and not a single American K setting up a
special operations training camp in

514
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,990
malaysia is asking

515
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,570
for a disaster arm and then Philippines

516
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,710
and so forth are you've got Latin
America

517
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,800
has an increasingly Muslim population in
the Tri border region

518
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,190
down by Argentina and stuff you've got
increasing connections between ethnic

519
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,639
criminal gangs and terrorists and so
forth thank you very much

520
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:38,840
arm and so I don't think we thought
through Afghanistan we sure as hell

521
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,200
at the policy level did not think
through Iraq

522
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,030
because a rock first off was an
unnecessary war

523
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,850
arm saddam hussein what

524
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,490
well i i kinda know how you feel about
this but I stand on my record

525
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,120
if you go back over my website over the
last two years you will see if you just

526
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,409
google for impeach Bush Cheney

527
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,230
you'll see the stuff they haven't seen
yet and I deliberately decided not to

528
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,860
delete anything now that I'm making
progress

529
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,200
with certain elements the administration
arm

530
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,690
intelligence field the policy feel too
you know Paul O'Neill in his book the

531
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,200
price of loyalty says

532
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,260
under reagan and bush line arm

533
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,899
policy started with its ideological
preferences but at least considered the

534
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,169
fax

535
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,639
in the bush administration call rolf
decides what the outcome is going to be

536
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:31,330
never mind the fax

537
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:35,030
and then dick cheney's the enforcer arm
so

538
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:38,550
I think we made a lot of mistakes and
what I would like to do was CIA is clean

539
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,580
it up

540
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:42,740
to the point that every secret
intelligence report has a public

541
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,490
intelligence counterpart

542
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,960
and the people are treated as a
constituency as is congress

543
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,880
okay let's go to another person spy
stories

544
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,240
this moral message question can you
confirm or deny

545
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,659
that the agency user still uses

546
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:05,070
shortwave numbers transmissions to

547
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,720
to message its I assets

548
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,860
this wonderful directory of all US
Embassy radio communications

549
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,990
frequencies are around the world

550
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,570
the last time I was involved in and
clandestine communications

551
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,290
involved a number group

552
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,340
all and it involved all radio
frequencies

553
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,260
all one-time pads

554
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,850
and usually the first digits had a and
indicators to weather was a real message

555
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,389
or filler message

556
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:44,540
ninety-nine percent commercial arrest

557
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,580
to the traffic is constant just to avoid

558
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,169
tracks data analysis exact thank you
you're welcome

559
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:56,610
K anything else alright

560
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,139
will have a question here please feel
free to take a break I mean

561
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:05,060
are I realize it's it's hard but enough
love you seem to be interested

562
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,418
yes sir I don't know if you spoke about
this just kinda what then

563
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,030
been from the CIA analyst of in
previously

564
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,230
previously what is your stand on the
polygraph

565
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,790
and using it to actively the polygraph

566
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,330
is is first off not reliable

567
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,929
the polygraph can be beaten the
polygraph

568
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:31,770
is not a science is more than art

569
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,040
the most effective use the polygraph is
in the pre disclosure

570
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,109
face are when people are inspired to

571
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:41,109
reveal things and and talk about that

572
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:45,740
having said that I will also say that
the polygraph is a valuable tool

573
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,810
there's a book called spies in lies by
one of the CIA's best polygraph

574
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,379
examiners in vietnam it's a wonderful
book

575
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:57,980
and if you do nothing else read my
review of that book arm

576
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,399
the polygraph is one of many tools now
the problem that we have

577
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:07,119
is that Washington is dominated by a
security bureaucracy the guts to it

578
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,159
got to its a gust Frank after twenty
years

579
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,230
checking safes at night these are not

580
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,840
rocket scientists on and they tend to
thank you SO

581
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,349
are they tend to arm

582
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:24,550
they tend to be

583
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,599
ninety percent to lax and 10 percent too
hard

584
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,780
on ames was too lax

585
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,429
I mean how much does it take to figure
out that the guy pay cash for five

586
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:39,310
hundred thousand dollar housing was
driving a jaguar

587
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,879
on a GS for teens pay which at the time
was

588
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,168
65,000 a year arm

589
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:49,908
on the other hand they can be like an
inquisition

590
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:53,500
and they can castrate you without trial
arm

591
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,410
I just came from dinner with the case
officer: that was basically

592
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,529
thrown out at the agency for sleeping
within israel

593
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,660
israeli and not breaking off the
relationship when she was told to

594
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,190
she thought she was in love I'm pretty
sure he wasn't lost

595
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,190
are and based on the conversation I'm
inclined to think that the israeli may

596
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,180
also have been saying things that were
picked up by signals that she didn't

597
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,779
realize he was saying

598
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,400
sometimes israelis will justify the
expense account

599
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,900
by claim or others will justify the
expense account by claiming that someone

600
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,290
is a recruited agencies providing
information

601
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,550
may be completely false but he managed
to screw this lady and

602
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,190
more ways than one arm

603
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,470
shell the other promise security is

604
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,160
an intelligence careers dot com really
understands this problem

605
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,480
corporations are allowed to hire ten
percent love

606
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,480
the people to work on a and a contract
that requires clearances

607
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,440
without Clarence's but they can only do
that for six months

608
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,930
but it takes 18 months for this
incompetent government to do a security

609
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,520
investigation

610
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,950
okay and that's one of the reasons why
they prefer white boys from kansas and

611
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:06,080
and virgins from West Virginia

612
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,460
arm because they've never met a
foreigner

613
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,790
are and as a result they're getting the
wrong kinds of people into the system

614
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,750
they're also getting people that are way
too young are if I were changing things

615
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,680
today

616
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,940
I would take 150 the people from the
under 35 population

617
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,060
I would try not to kill them with
grenade accidents are

618
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,710
in training which just happened a year
ago

619
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,720
arm and then the rest of them are

620
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,890
mature US citizens have spent a lifetime
building cover

621
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,259
I can crack any cover inside a week to
30 days

622
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,030
you cannot build a false legend today

623
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,460
with all the computers and everything is
just too easy to check

624
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,990
so what you do is you get guys that have
been forty to fifty years old with an

625
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,010
overseas have a rolodex speak the
language have unwittingly built their

626
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,010
cover

627
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:02,090
and then you bring them into the spiking
are and tell us your caught you're fired

628
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,280
so they'll take security seriously arm

629
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,080
you have what are called career agents
which are very well-qualified

630
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,910
venezuelans pakistanis whatever you
treat them just like a sauce is we don't

631
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,520
have these anymore

632
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,230
treated just like a saucers in the field
but they never come back to headquarters

633
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,410
and they never touch secrets

634
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,450
or sick again or anything else are you
have

635
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,810
field stations are multinational this is
how I would run it

636
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:31,390
you feel sessions are multinational the
DEA has figured out

637
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,500
how to make you some honest Mexican cops
and the way you do is you bring them out

638
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,170
of their system and you put them into
your own little

639
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,530
Brotherhood group and that works

640
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,630
leading Mexican headquarters tell you
what they want you to know doesn't work

641
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,130
okay so we need to go after Francis the
French really good a penetrating the

642
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,070
arabs

643
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,300
they've managed to create a second third
generation of arabs

644
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,680
that are both loyal to france and able
to penetrate the the Arab communities

645
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,848
we should be using them are and the same
thing with israelis who have some really

646
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:02,390
fine

647
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:05,930
Arab penetrations arm and then

648
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,799
I'll last but not least it's just
business

649
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,830
we persist in treating spying as a thing
that requires

650
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,090
you take a polygraph you be recruited
asset

651
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,990
there are some cases where I just want
to be able to talk to tyson look I want

652
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:23,140
to put this technical device into this
thing going to this place

653
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,180
I'll give you a million dollars in you
never hear from me again it's just

654
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,930
business

655
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,279
okay well you gotta be gone at exactly
the right place

656
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,300
arm but the point is we're being very

657
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,880
on imaginative and the polygraph
unfortunately I think security has

658
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,460
become part of the problem

659
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,150
arm if I were advising a new DC I won my
first directors would be to completely

660
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,609
revamp security

661
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:52,170
are security is now part of the problem
not part of the solution

662
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,420
and that's true cross all of the
agencies

663
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,230
NSA polygraphs are better this is good
news for you I'm sure

664
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,520
an essay polygraphs are better and CIA
polygraphs

665
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,520
an assay you get a bigger softer cheer
and their kinder and gentler in their

666
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,630
probing

667
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,780
cell II Kershaw love you to consider
working for the US intelligence

668
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,230
community

669
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,310
even if you only do it for couples years
it will change you forever

670
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,730
arm and if you can't work for the US
intelligence community then

671
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:25,440
DoD intelligence career stock common
pick up a job at SAIC

672
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,970
or any one of these the Beltway bandits
that is making a fortune

673
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,369
pretending to do intelligence arm and

674
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:36,349
and have a little fun just like you only
get to be an infantry officer once in

675
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,180
your life

676
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,460
arm and it's something he can only do
when you're young

677
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,160
another question so we take a break

678
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,060
yes sir

679
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,380
we handle incompetence by ignoring it
you know part of the problem is it in in

680
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,090
the agent in the aged the Internet

681
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:02,960
in theory you should be able are our
approach at least the the CIA approaches

682
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,760
once you have your SAT K

683
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,180
CIA Baba clarence you can pretty much go
anywhere in see anything

684
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,660
arm and it shouldn't be that way I mean
you should be

685
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,509
able to only see things in your area and

686
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,520
at the same time you should not be
blocked from seeing things one of the

687
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,369
problems we have is over
compartmentation

688
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:26,119
I invented the reverse search it see I
precisely because this

689
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,990
what was happening was analysts were
asking questions are the system

690
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,950
like say what do we know about Libyan
T-seventy two tanks doing this

691
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,160
and the TIO was refusing to tell the
analysts

692
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,089
and so I invented the concept of a a
reverse search

693
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,880
which would which would tell the deal
that this analysts at this question why

694
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,660
they needed to know

695
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,140
when I was taken by my chief of station
up to talk to the else before I went to

696
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,118
my first feel station assignment his
marching orders from

697
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:58,240
mean work keep your mouth shut dot com
anything arm

698
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,000
now we're trying CIA has tried to merge
analysts and collectors

699
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,609
look what you have is good-hearted
people who are being hired by the wrong

700
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:08,180
model

701
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,480
managed by the wrong mindset to the
wrong hands

702
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,359
arm you don't create a world-class
intelligence community with young kids

703
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,520
at a Kansas

704
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,810
and really shitty technical processing
and no clandestine service and no

705
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,920
attention open sources of information

706
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,820
are and excessive reliance on foreign
liaison so what you have a systemic

707
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,300
incompetence rather than personal
incompetence

708
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,280
are every person there wants to do a
good job every person there is also

709
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,500
helpless in the face both decades

710
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,520
other naw supplied industrial your
system

711
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,410
that basically demands that you go
through the motions and pretend

712
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,350
everything's fine

713
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:53,720
up when in fact the system is an is in
terminal phase of its collapse

714
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,970
and all the snow this in 1985 are in
fact when I review janine brookner's

715
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,220
book on litigating intelligence
community

716
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:07,800
what CIA like to do to its agitators was
sent into a fitness for duty physical

717
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,390
with the emphasis was on calling them
nuts and then threatening them

718
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,210
so that they would resign in order to
preserve their options for other federal

719
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,530
reemployment by not being labeled knots

720
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,190
by CIA arm in fact is I look back at the

721
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:26,130
five or ten people five to 10 people
that I know that had fitness for duty

722
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,160
physical experiences and then resign
they were nuts they were the ones who

723
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,790
had it right

724
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:34,450
in our john gentry Road wrote a book
called The Lost promise I think it is

725
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,570
about all that's wrong with CIA arm

726
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:40,600
analysis I've written a book on
intelligence which is all that's wrong

727
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,850
with the entire community

728
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,560
arm others have written similar books
and yet they were labeled as traders

729
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,590
outcasts

730
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:52,490
the you know and so forth had they
listen to us in 1985 to 1990 I'm pretty

731
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,130
sure 911 would not have happened

732
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,490
okay we brought 911 on our own hats
yessir

733
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:01,410
me stories about into reliance action

734
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:05,210
the US UK degree manner being yes yes

735
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:10,760
the US is not allowed to collect on US
politicians so the British do it for us

736
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,200
and we collect on the canadians and it's
like a round-robin so we break each

737
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,290
others laws on our

738
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:21,910
on each other's bf yessir area

739
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:26,640
questions or even as a slight I'm used
to being ignored when I was out I know

740
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,770
on 911 on

741
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,580
mean there was in place norad system
would basically when interceptor

742
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:37,819
aircraft the street at bears airspace
and

743
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,910
system actually work pretty good before
9/11 the mean

744
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,310
hundreds airplanes it had gone of course
in

745
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:48,440
the way intercepting within 10 minutes
on this day

746
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,490
the Air Force miss all or gets or

747
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,619
is I understand story how could that
happen

748
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:58,820
well I think the best account on record
as Dick Clark's

749
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,200
although I believe the the Commission on
9/11 wall

750
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,619
will come out with some other stuff

751
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,890
are guy name Charles power i think what
a book called normal accidents dealing

752
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,660
with high-risk technology

753
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,029
he talks about how simple systems have
single points of failure

754
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,609
the failing easy to diagnose and correct
ways

755
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:25,480
complex systems have multiple points of
failure that that interact

756
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,060
%uh in their multiple cascade that very
hard to diagnose and fix

757
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,210
and the US government as a constellation
of complex systems

758
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:37,020
don't talk to each other very well I'm
willing to believe

759
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,320
that 9/11 was a catalog love

760
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,490
errors across a number of points

761
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:48,660
including Bush is not coming back to
town arm

762
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:53,399
I also think it's very important to
emphasize that a large part of the loss

763
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
of life in 9/11 occurred

764
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,990
because our police and and fire
communications in New York suck

765
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:04,109
are there not designed to be reliable
and high rise buildings

766
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:07,960
they're not designed to be interoperable
are there not designed in fact this is

767
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,490
still true overseas as Marines are
flying in to rescue an embassy they can

768
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:13,410
talk to the embassy

769
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,440
from the helicopter okay we have just
basically bill

770
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,490
you guys know the word kluge okay this
is kluge on steroids

771
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,640
okay the US government is a mess

772
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:30,670
are it's got many good people everybody
I think tries to do a good job and it's

773
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,010
just

774
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:36,460
its just a total mess command control
communications computing intelligence

775
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,200
is Cascais ask

776
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,980
every other airplane that street from
airspace people that

777
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,109
I don't know that I don't know the facts
but but I think here we had basically 20

778
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:50,600
to 30 minutes

779
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,020
during which half of it was wasted are

780
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,060
they're also Konami's the Pentagon has
been gutted

781
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,350
people are no longer doing strip alerts
arm

782
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,400
I just I just think everything that
could have gone wrong did go wrong

783
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,530
you just refuse to believe that
conspiracy in

784
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,680
no you show me the fax and I'll believe
it but I don't think the fact that their

785
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,649
arm you know there's this urban myths
about the israelis told every june the

786
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,400
World Trade Center not to show up for
work I don't think so

787
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,200
%ah look a let's go back to the basic
fact that all k to hit the world trade

788
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,400
center with a car bomb in 1993

789
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,890
they have a track record of coming back
to the same target they have a

790
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,560
they have a fixation on cultural targets
that were in fact

791
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,410
several airplanes I I think the
grounding the airplanes immediately was

792
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:44,470
one up the

793
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,140
in wretched I wasn't smart enough to
think about this on the day of the event

794
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,160
I think what I would have done was sent
out a broadcast message from the

795
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,899
president

796
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,970
every single airline offering immediate
presidential pardon to anybody who

797
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,240
murdered an asshole on the way the
cockpit

798
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,430
okay and and let the planes continue on
their path exact cost us a lot of money

799
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,770
to ground the aircraft

800
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:08,290
but grounding the aircraft actually
prevent it hits on Sears Tower

801
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:12,900
are in Chicago and Bank of America and
CNN atlanta bank American San Francisco

802
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,300
on CNN atlanta

803
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,119
which are also on the list I think there
was another plane designated for the

804
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,609
white house in the capital

805
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:22,380
okay a surrounding the airplanes
actually prevented several other

806
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,900
things arm I mean when I look at the FBI

807
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,910
I know FBI Special Agents in their good
dedicated smart people who are trapped

808
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,640
in a really rotten system

809
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,890
if you look at Special Agent rallies
testimony

810
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,200
she's got shitty management should the
data processing

811
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,570
arm shitty relations with the CIA

812
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,130
the whole systems broke it you know and
and so

813
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,400
if you want to talk about a conspiracy I
will talk about a conspiracy of

814
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,240
inattentive Publix in an attempt to
politicians

815
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,310
and intelligence professionals who
haven't been willing to speak up there

816
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,140
were 15 books

817
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,799
by intelligence practitioner authors
published in the two years prior to 9/11

818
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,060
that's unheard of

819
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:07,500
number of books all of them advocating
jerk on Intelligence Reform

820
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:11,480
and nobody prior to 9/11 wanted to
listen to me or anybody else

821
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,000
very quickly well basically I just wanna

822
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,050
one you thirty-seconds government night

823
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,359
just you don't feel comfortable I making
authoritative statement about the

824
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:23,830
technical details

825
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,859
involving the airplane honey I would be
willing to believe that dick cheney

826
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:29,830
incall roles

827
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:34,350
understood that Franklin eleanor
roosevelt won at Pearl Harbor to happen

828
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:37,759
in order to be able to mobilize America
and I would be willing to to believe

829
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,410
that dick cheney in car rolls if they
had some inkling of 9/11

830
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:44,879
would have downplayed in order to allow
it to happen and don't think this is

831
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,900
unusual

832
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:51,430
Jim Bamford and the puzzle palace wrote
how the JCS the Joint Chiefs of Staff

833
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:55,669
proposed a covert operation to kill
Americans on American soil

834
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,620
are in order to justify an attack on
cuba

835
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:03,380
do not underestimate the idiocy

836
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,819
of people in power but on balance

837
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:11,230
I think 9/11 was a catalog error
spanning multiple years

838
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,780
all of which can be traced back to are a
combination of political

839
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,790
irresponsibility and professional
incompetence

840
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:22,950
across the board okay

841
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:28,069
next I was on a review if you could tell
something about numbers stations

842
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:31,990
number stations yeah

843
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:38,740
no I what I can tell you is that I have
to go to the bathroom

844
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,310
I

845
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,110
are just recycle

846
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:48,470
I right one quick question and then I'm
gonna go to the bathroom will take up

847
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,520
ten minute break in

848
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,220
but I'll continue with whoever wants to
survive and if I can ask the staff to

849
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:54,440
supervise the Pens

850
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,780
for 10 to 15 minutes any %uh view that
haven't gotten a piano repeaters are

851
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,380
taking your photo every single one again
on

852
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,050
K I'll this might be a dangerous
question however

853
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,370
let's say you were a terrorist
organization planning United States

854
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:13,290
what would you attack and more to the
point how would you

855
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,680
as the United States defend against
that's where schoolkids

856
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,029
and shopping malls across america i'd

857
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:28,100
I'd from it by scaring the crap out of
every single parent okay

858
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,270
are tom ridge hasn't done it RC week
week we cannot do top-down protection

859
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:36,320
we have to do bottom-up protection arm

860
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,270
for example I was asked to review the
Marine Corps counterintelligence a

861
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,610
counter-terrorism plan

862
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,850
up by Colonel that that respected my
work

863
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,440
and I said Tom all you've done is triple
the guards and double the cement

864
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,710
I said that's not how you defend
insulation what you have to do

865
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,590
is have an eight hundred-number or and a
website URL I said you have to go up

866
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,720
fifty kilometers

867
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,420
around your perimeter and you have to
brief every waitress in every truck

868
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,080
driver

869
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,430
and every rental car guy and every hotel
motel clerk

870
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,250
whatever and you have to tell them what
you worried about what you're looking

871
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:10,740
for

872
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,370
and then when they call you shouldn't
hang up on okay so that's kinda pushing

873
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,589
out this concept of neighborhood watch

874
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,850
which is a perfectly legitimate
voluntary concept is not

875
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:25,500
about total awareness and and peeping I
am by the way in Iraq

876
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,370
we're jailing and killing people who are
being declared as terrorists and

877
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,020
criminals

878
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,780
by jilted lovers and people who want to
get out of debt the same thing that

879
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,160
happened with the Phoenix program

880
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,080
in vietnam we are naive arm

881
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,930
I don't believe that we are any safer
from the Homeland Security expenditures

882
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,240
on first responders

883
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,520
it doesn't help us do preventive
counterintelligence

884
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,330
inside America given that I've said
we've already got a thousand sleeper

885
00:51:52,330 --> 00:51:53,810
agents inside America

886
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,730
are and second everything we're doing
our foreign policy

887
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,470
is essentially aiding and abetting been
lot george bush

888
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:05,700
is a bin Laden wet dream for sure

889
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,800
sorta by quick all the

890
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,880
information that this would generate for
all the all the calls it you're gonna

891
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,250
get

892
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,330
deluge nation is the answer sorting
through this information more money

893
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:20,890
or what is the answer to sort through
mindset we've got plenty money in

894
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:21,450
america

895
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,730
I'm gonna go to the bathroom I will be
back in 10 minutes

896
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:30,510
and if the staff can tryin makes sense
in these pants please i ask you to be on

897
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,240
your honor

898
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,620
not come another pan if you've already
got
