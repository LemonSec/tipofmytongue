1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,059
check check in a minute check this by
comparing the costliest

2
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,549
checker checker

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,610
okay we're good are welcome to

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,799
I hacker radio as everyone doing

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,640
Saturday alright I'm here

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,800
prison tater here presenter sorry slow
mode

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,199
and will be Emory Law okay well what is
Harry do.

8
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,429
and this is a my my definition a bit

9
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:33,859
ACA radio is a spreading information
awareness ideas

10
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:37,430
provides a formal discussion about the
topics that we face in a technological

11
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,710
world today

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,219
ACA radios audio using distributed over
the Internet or

13
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:46,600
radio so it can it's basically audio
committee internet or radio

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,649
arm and where did all start

15
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,379
and this is kinda going back to where
hackers and other people that are

16
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:57,149
interested in technology we're spreading
information idea

17
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,839
ideas and getting the word out

18
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:04,599
basically it all start with ham radio
and shortwave radio

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,220
on after it has been around since early
nineteen hundred's

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,369
and the it contains be a very popular

21
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,170
medium of communication today and you
can go and get registered as an

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,549
regulations and

23
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,990
show ever obviously you can do
communications over

24
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,189
different continents and so very popular

25
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,799
medium today bulletin boards

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,909
on Baltimore it's been around since 1978

27
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,969
is from what I've researched and they're
still popular

28
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,810
up until the early 90s there is some
bull towards out there i'm talking

29
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,689
about. dial-up

30
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:43,130
Baltimore it's not forums and stuff like
that mom and that was

31
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,630
the way that people got their commoner
in there

32
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,899
their modem and found their favorite PBS
and i holed up in communicated to

33
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,840
all their fellow bodies and spread the
word and and a

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,539
important I web sites

35
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:03,170
is the next one who oppose sorry this is
the way this is get my neck

36
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,300
our website is a been busy ever since
ago for an 80 people recall

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,840
everyone's the gotten their word out but
their web page up

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,800
discuss the issues now out blogs is a
big thing that

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,870
that people have so they can talk about
what they want to talk about get there

40
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,560
ideas across mailing lists

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,040
our mailing list have been around since
nineteen 71

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,250
from what I've researched and that's
just another medium

43
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,750
spreading information new servers

44
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,440
new servers is Usenet back in 1979

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,659
is the first use a a new server and

46
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:48,230
that's another way that people been able
to interactively respond back and forth

47
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,768
on e-zines textiles magazines print
materials

48
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:54,769
26 in a magazine is a great way OVA

49
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,180
spring hacker word frack on this planet
e-zines that are out there

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,549
I its it's still a big scene today I

51
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,150
text files is still a big scene that's
that's going on out there

52
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,370
and various printed materials things
like awareness stuff that

53
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,610
has been passed out here at the con arm
you know

54
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,090
web sites links to website stuff like
that all these things are being used

55
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,790
together

56
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,548
to talk about technical issues

57
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,629
on technical and social issues impacting
technology

58
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:27,649
I on society in people's a whole

59
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,110
and forms a new site so things like
Slashdot

60
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,129
popular forms of people go to for
various subjects

61
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:40,989
arm and and and communicate back and
forth and of course it moves on to hack

62
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:41,720
a radio which

63
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,010
is is the purpose of this talk is that
its it's called surveyed into

64
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,329
a barrage of everything on moving into
audio which is more interactive

65
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,980
you know getting this more things you
can do with audio and get some life

66
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,140
feedback and and and stuff that's going
on

67
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,549
arm with audio what to what do hackers

68
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,060
are why do hackers cover the site for
information why are they such a good

69
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,689
choice

70
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:07,269
to to cover this type of stuff I'm
hackers in general like to spread

71
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:08,739
information and awareness

72
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,689
I'm a very curious people and we like to

73
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,750
play with things usually five core stuff
we like to share

74
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,930
so I am and hackers on the first to
discover important subjects

75
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,730
such as how technology affects our lives
and our future as technology progresses

76
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,290
and you know all of us know that

77
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,500
it's becoming more integrate with our
lives every day either is for

78
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,580
entertainment

79
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,640
are comes to you you know laws in and

80
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,840
you know tracking individuals and stuff
like that

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
government agencies or even companies
that are fine detects and all the

82
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,330
problems that those kinda things Canada

83
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,450
create hackers helped to develop
important survival techniques within our

84
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,240
technological society

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,300
well in playing with all these
technologies or being aware of certain

86
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,300
things

87
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,320
on day 10 to come up with tips up what
you can do to avoid certain things we

88
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,540
can do to help us turn cause

89
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,300
arm general common sense within the tech
community there's a different

90
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,590
there's common sense and there's common
sense on on

91
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,980
on assert no different fields of study
and and and when it comes to you

92
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,080
the technical field hackers have a a
common sense how to

93
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,669
to to exist in that field and

94
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,110
progress in and all that critical
thinking hackers develop innovation

95
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,660
through the existing technologies or by
creating new ones

96
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,750
so you know there's also technologies
that

97
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,860
is a technology for of ID's where r
there was an RFID the broadcasts all

98
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,710
these different RFID signals

99
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,909
so it's kind of like confusing the other
RF ID's

100
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,190
if there was a scanner some like that on
trading technologies like that creating

101
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,230
I'm

102
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,500
you know stuff of the Linux operating
system and tools you can use firewalls

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,360
and

104
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,160
and and just just a whole barrage of
things I mean just to cover that subject

105
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,720
alone could be a whole talk

106
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,120
what are some other topics that hacker
radio covers her some the main ones

107
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,400
on it can cover anything in general

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,270
I am the world attacking I also

109
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,770
the world phone freaking discussion of
social and legal issues that have to do

110
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,460
with the impact of technology on our
world

111
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,909
those kinda things like using Linux and
SCO attacking

112
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,460
open source I you know using Microsoft
and their

113
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,670
problems with their operating system and
their politics &

114
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,960
I having copyright

115
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,800
being done on software over in the EU
limiting

116
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,940
on innovation and all those things that
that

117
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,120
in the end impact the people these are
all

118
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,040
things that companies are doing to
maintain their dominance

119
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,620
and or even governments to maintain
their control

120
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,960
and making people aware about the social
impact above those kinda technologies

121
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,380
and their politics on the people
discussion in new technologies

122
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,150
on you know having the that that purse
the first to

123
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,320
spaceship that was done by a public
company

124
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,930
to get up in outer space lol there for a
little bit but to talk about so the new

125
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,500
things and some in the new exciting
things are going on in the world of

126
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,610
technology

127
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,400
and sharing those the the those the
subject

128
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,250
the discussion technical companies an
impact that corporate politics

129
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,700
can have and I i I to talk about that a
little bit

130
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,790
some the impacted that their politics
will have on you

131
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,810
and it's great we have open source
re-open source

132
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,830
because actually gives us a means our
using the the

133
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,979
technology computing in our own way and

134
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,470
and having a girl for others to be able
to use it as well

135
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,590
in lining and educational topics having
anything to do with technology

136
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,010
and process is technology

137
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,480
you know is is you know process

138
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,650
and the creation of new process ease and
that is

139
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,230
the anything you wanna talk about
basically I i do a show called in an

140
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,920
hour

141
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,940
and we'll be talking to the other shows
that are out there now

142
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,180
and how we started doing our show

143
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,660
was at me my friend would go shoot some
pool on after need clothes around one

144
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,410
o'clock

145
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,360
would stick around to talk about all the
subject we like to talk about for

146
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,770
another three hours four hours we said
hey when we just record this

147
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,810
so mom it's anything you know anything
that that that spreads awareness or even

148
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,110
just a

149
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,580
topics that people don't typically hear
about bomb

150
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:37,579
having a discussion and having people
here other people's ideas on that topic

151
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,699
so why not the other news you know the
news media cover

152
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,420
are such topics why don't they why
aren't they the ones that should be able

153
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,030
to cover such topics

154
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,610
as little kinda funny picture on hackers
can turn your computer into a bomb

155
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,010
okay this is gonna parity on but this is
why the

156
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,439
they're not the best idea to have I the
news covers such topics are

157
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,020
for small they're not really actually
have a the not really

158
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,449
the best ones to cover this kind of
topic

159
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,690
arm there also not really designed to
have

160
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,890
discussions on the side think usually
have political issues and the like to

161
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,430
discuss at a lot but they're not
consider and discuss

162
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,230
you know the things are going on with
open source and

163
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,760
the problems that Microsoft has with
certain companies and stuff like that

164
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,819
they do that lightly but not not as much
as they like to focus on other issues so

165
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,790
right now it may evolve into that and I
believe it will evolve more into talking

166
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,319
about technical issues

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,830
because it is impacting society more
MORE but for

168
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,860
at this point they're not they don't do
a very good job and they are getting

169
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,310
more educated persons other magazines
are out there like wired

170
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,830
and other news magazines you can get
your hands on they do companies kind of

171
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,730
issues and have writers they do cover

172
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,270
issues in a way that will will will
bring meaning and understanding and

173
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,449
and provide discussion for some the new
issues that we face in the world today

174
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,110
and things to consider in hack a radio
this is if you have your own show

175
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,740
and this is kinda what we want to talk
about his is is what it's about

176
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,870
and if you have your own show some
things you might wanna consider in doing

177
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,410
your own show

178
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,120
which is all about spreading the
awareness what type of content where you

179
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,570
have in your show

180
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,730
is it going to be a really relaxed show
is it going to be a very political show

181
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,740
are you gonna focus on a certain area
that you

182
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,530
really feel strongly about and you're an
expert in and you really want to make

183
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,280
sure

184
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,280
that act it out and it it or think so

185
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,630
there's also two different areas in
cover we talk about on a different areas

186
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,140
like you know hacking freaking
technologies the social impact stuff

187
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,449
like that

188
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,960
new technology so you can take your pick
even come up with a new one that I

189
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,220
didn't bullet there

190
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,900
and and go with it how often are you
going to do your show

191
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,780
now with my busy schedule I do my show
every two weeks

192
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,459
there's a lot of shows to do it every
week and there are some

193
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,680
I actually don't have any shows a do it
every day arm but you can

194
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,420
you need to pick a schedule that you can
stick to and

195
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,540
have your listeners know that you're
gonna get a show up by then because when

196
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,150
she went to develop a listenership

197
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,740
they're gonna have that show and they're
gonna be looking for you and you don't

198
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,050
let them down

199
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,140
so need to decide that

200
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,600
also show gonna be live or pre-recorded
I do my show

201
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,820
pre-record I didn't show live for a
while I

202
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,890
if you do it live you know you typically
doing it out of your home

203
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,560
or if you're if you're lucky enough you
can actually go to radio studio

204
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,440
and do it over the radio which we do you
know someone that did you

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,380
a show which be our cameraman over there
on you is on the radio

206
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,260
I but you can also mom if you do it live

207
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,410
beginning consider it to consider band
with would you get what

208
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,719
how you can spread it out there you know
how what type of audio streams are going

209
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,450
to be

210
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,920
I getting places that will carry it for
you if you have a nice fat hide you can

211
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,680
just care yourself up their own website
few hosted

212
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,330
arm pre-recorded that's just obviously
recording yourself

213
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,620
and putting up a file later for somebody
to download and take a look at

214
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,870
at their leisure and obviously it's it
archived which is which is a good thing

215
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,190
you can have your initials are even if
you do a lot an archived shows

216
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:17,910
so anybody can go back and listen to an
episode how are you going to spread the

217
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,360
word about your show

218
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,610
are you gonna let me know I mean you
doing the show because you

219
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,680
you want to you wanna share any also I
get some feedback

220
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,500
I mean this isn't just you pimping your
ideas out for everyone to listen to and

221
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,800
bowed down to this is

222
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,810
this is a a community thing and

223
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,880
you wanna have feedback you wanna
provide a means for people to give you

224
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,730
information

225
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:43,340
about your show I'm so spread the word
out about your show you can do on

226
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,029
you know if you have a lot of friends
you can put those are web buttons

227
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,380
on their sites and stuff like that's why
things I do you mom

228
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,160
and do the same thing for them you know
help spread the awareness of

229
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,589
as much as you can on you can actually

230
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,040
get your stream in certain places where
they pay the bill take

231
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,719
I you know prior a public radio or
public audio streams and posted up there

232
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,950
for people listen to so you can do that
on

233
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,190
you know the whole search engine thing
so everything in the wide spread

234
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,350
awareness typically just like any other

235
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,210
percent spread awareness you can do it
anyway mailers post a bulletin board

236
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,529
that you might find people their
interest in this kind of thing

237
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:27,230
well your show of capabilities such as
Collins listener email

238
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,300
live RC chat telephone conferences
ex-senator

239
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,670
now I've done a few these and some other
shows do do these all at once

240
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,890
on cable's comments yet you can actually
do Collins now

241
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,220
there some technical aspects are doing a
call in it some people record while

242
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,940
they're on a conference call

243
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,779
and the record straight to their sound
card they have their sound card I'll out

244
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:53,089
into a conference call and they're using
a microphone

245
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,300
and they can speak to the to the
conference

246
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,310
telecom doesn't comment and other people
can get on

247
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,640
and and and and communicate back for the
numbers they are on call and

248
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,800
United a speakerphone which is very
popular to put a speakerphone and a

249
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,740
microphone

250
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,770
and you call into a telephone conference
you advertise a telephone number at a

251
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,640
time

252
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,890
and there's a lot of free conference is
out there is going to move on up to find

253
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,850
a lot about

254
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,860
arm and they can call and and you can
just you can use them if you want to

255
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,270
and and do your show and I'll be
listening to the whole time say okay

256
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,439
we'll come back as a buddy was begun

257
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,960
and bring in my back and people can talk
about some

258
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,730
anything they want signet Collins and
his there's other ways I'm doing and I'm

259
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,779
sure

260
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,400
our listener email course with the
website have an email a website can

261
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,930
email address their get things going
like that

262
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,850
actually forgot that now you can about
abort abort some decompose online SA

263
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,540
you know go ahead and post whatever you
want for me to even talk about

264
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,480
or your comments on a previous show or
anything like that Walcott will

265
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,130
collaborate altogether and do a some
follow-up

266
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,410
on then there's live IRC chat we do have
a a

267
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,339
NRC chat room and you know you can fire
that up if you want to what you're doing

268
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:06,390
the show

269
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,470
and people can be listening not really
works best if you doing it live if you

270
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,570
have an RC

271
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,960
on chat room opening some like that
because otherwise they're really not

272
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,540
going to know what you're talking about

273
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,550
so if you don't some live say hey you
know for jump onto the yom

274
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,100
a you know whatever the room is on your
server and while we're

275
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,220
while we're chatting will go ahead look
at what people are saying and

276
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,029
you know bring in the show's well and
telco tell from comp just talked about

277
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,070
that

278
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,740
the technicalities love having your own
show

279
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,220
what recording equipment do we use and
I'll cover that on the next slide here

280
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,100
what software do we use to record the
audio typically this is going to be

281
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,990
required on your computer

282
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,170
what audio format will your show be in
civil right it's pretty easy

283
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,610
him as a mp3 Aug are some benefits and
downsides I'll talk about that

284
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,960
how will the show be distributed how you
get out there what goes back to the

285
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,040
whole life pre-recorded thing

286
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,209
okay we're recording equipment do we use
now here's the the

287
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,630
the the lowest Henry here's what you can
do the most common way to report issues

288
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,570
your computer sound card

289
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,640
a microphone and or speaker phone

290
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,779
so basically just butt plug a microphone
in there and you can record just like

291
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,820
that now it's kinda tough give you gas
money

292
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,040
pass around or like I said you doing I'm
show we're calling people long distance

293
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,430
maybe

294
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,730
maybe year maybe I guess in your show
they're not Collins they may be everyday

295
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,710
guess that are always on your show

296
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,610
but their long distance you know and if
so they're not going to be where your at

297
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,580
you can you can use the speakerphone

298
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,110
and call them up I get get them already
had a time

299
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,430
and then no place to make fun down there
when they speak as well or just me and

300
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,480
put it in a general area get a nice Mike

301
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,630
and everyone can just talk like that

302
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,800
an annex up this what I have I can spend
some money but this was because I wanted

303
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,610
to do a few other things with audio

304
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,330
I actually have a a four channel mixer
with two

305
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,030
two auxiliary engines a headphone amp we
all have headphones

306
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,030
and we have a

307
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,619
see you play the bugs and everyone some
background music and

308
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,230
we used to have a device we had one
person on the show gonna call we're

309
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,300
and effects processor rerun audio
through the effects processor

310
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,319
that some cool stuff and some fun to the
show added the

311
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,670
Mr help you know you you wanna make the
show interesting with your talk but it's

312
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,179
also kinda fun to have some

313
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,440
some are some other things going on the
background as well

314
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,750
you can also record yourself in guess
purporting audio from a voice over IP

315
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,490
call on your computer

316
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,679
or by making a phone call with your
modem so making phone call the mod ok on

317
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,179
saying we talked about

318
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,330
there's also you know Voice over IP
programs Lynn phone is one open source

319
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,120
one

320
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,610
others voice over IP services that
people use to make phone calls

321
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,880
Armando's type services you can
depending on what you use

322
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,880
somehow pipe in their way here getting
it recording

323
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,670
see you can use that to to record so
that we don't have my microphone

324
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,600
well you're going to buy microphone
unless you calling on that system

325
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,610
yourself

326
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,670
any most likely you can at least

327
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,440
and if you're lucky you can actually is
a radio studio to do your show so

328
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,550
armed and there are some studios out
that they do that you know you can go

329
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,300
I am radio and in some places heck
emmanuel goldstein does WBAI

330
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,559
off the hook so I mean that's that I
consider

331
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,940
you know to be an actor radio as well so
if you're lucky enough to get a radio

332
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,740
studio

333
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,690
to help you in your in your broadcast
your show and all that

334
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,790
I like to cover open source that these
are some other popular programs that I

335
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,510
views and other people I know that use
to record their audio race down

336
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,320
and audacity on they both will get the
job done

337
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,040
I'll raise down for me is a little bit
more

338
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,870
I like it will be more because it has
more features that old ASI

339
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,710
doesn't have this is I'm not really into
go too much into it but it claims to be

340
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,100
a stable open source a graphic audio
file editor primary but not limited to

341
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,890
the late I bring system

342
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,940
I use raison because I actually clean up
the audio likely not any peaks in the

343
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,020
audio

344
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,080
mom so it's a nice clean set a value I
have this down here because if you want

345
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,960
to

346
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,330
save it as a 16 killed it I it's

347
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,809
a file format in mp3 in our sample rate
of 16

348
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:23,950
that stick many news so if you want to
use write that down you can

349
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,000
and I'll talk about that just a second
really what that means

350
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,910
because there's different file sizes and
if you have an hour show

351
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,820
and you have a %uh 128 kilobits mp3 file
you know it's going to be

352
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,189
tens of makes and your listeners are not
gonna download that

353
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,370
and you're not going to want to have the
van with trying to keep supporting the

354
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,380
van with 22

355
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,280
to be able to download that but yeah
with reason I can clean the audio up

356
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,399
I can run filters on it mom it's great
and other city works as well a lot of

357
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,330
people use it want people are happy with
that

358
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,659
this is just there description what they
have on their website for for

359
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,049
for what their software is basically it
as all in all everything

360
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,290
for for audio and stuff like that
doesn't have enough

361
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,379
as many features as raison but it's
getting

362
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,780
and either way you can use it so what
every whatever you like the best

363
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,760
what audio format will the show be in
now the most popular audio formats mp3

364
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,570
it's not an open standard so a lot of
people that are really

365
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,629
a diehards for open source open
standards

366
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,559
made their way from doing that now
there's only one downside to it and and

367
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,500
that might not be a permit downside

368
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,640
is that or will not sit well that's the
downside is

369
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,610
is it's not open standard for Aug 4
visited open standard

370
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,000
the only downside to that one it's not a
permanent downside but it is a little

371
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,130
bit of a downside

372
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,370
is if you have people that want to
listen to their Aug files on portable

373
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,640
devices that don't support

374
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,160
Aug so that's the only thing is that
they want to take it around

375
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,210
on they can always take Augen and for
and bring it to an audio CD of course

376
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,590
and pop it in their CD player to look
for one the three players don't have any

377
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:07,540
art sports stuff like that

378
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,370
okay this is how the show will be
distributed here some ideas

379
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,900
that you can use obviously you can
archive files

380
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,860
%uh shows on the web so that's one way
to do it I mean you want to do that

381
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,710
regardless a

382
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,870
whatever means you do in excessive dis
archiving your files you wanna make sure

383
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,770
that that's at least on

384
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,670
live stream to your show there's you can
use shoutcast Icecast

385
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,720
and I actually don't know if there's
anything else out there shoutcast been

386
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,590
around for ever

387
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,139
very popular intake one file streaming
out too many listeners

388
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,840
on and Icecast is is a a little bit
newer

389
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,689
and you can do the same thing with them
subtle differences

390
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,080
but its you can use it distributed media
server on other media

391
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,340
outlets I know for Winamp they actually
have on their website

392
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,360
elicit shoutcast servers that you can
just pick

393
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,420
a feed and listen to radio

394
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,390
they have been very popular and
spreading the word on Hacker radio

395
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,179
there's a lot of people that have used
radio are not use work with my radio

396
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,400
to stream their show out and get the
word out so a

397
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,179
if you're interested in what is contrary
to calm and check it out

398
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:20,740
we are located the on argue that text
files that calm now that's an

399
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,770
archival play civ all sorts of stuff

400
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,929
if you guys know about text files like
com ever audio that text files that com

401
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,200
which is basically there's a lot of
shows

402
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,740
better on the technical nature that are
archived there for people listen to

403
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,850
and there is one under is one

404
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,559
it says shows under audit all types of
audio but this one is a shows

405
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:44,840
there's a lot of shows you go to rate
now and check out those shows

406
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,980
and take a listen to him and no go back
to you know the big

407
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,910
their beginnings up into a car the
current shows they have now

408
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,730
now hacker media dotnet there there are
new web site that's up

409
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,730
and I don't really know so much about
the have a lot of shows there

410
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,620
that they have that you can listen to
and ask the bond they say if you have a

411
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,590
show

412
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,340
that you'd like to have a peer let us
know so you can get your shot their net

413
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,449
it's another way

414
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,620
to to get the word out plus hacker media
means it's a

415
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,640
that this site name itself explains it
well so

416
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,350
it's a good place to to put your show

417
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,640
and some other shows that are out there
now

418
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,970
quite a few that I know I love there's
in the now

419
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,010
which is the one that I do and that's
that can be found at slip net dot org

420
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,520
soit

421
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,120
NET .org oMG radio freedom Erica

422
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,600
which I'm have do will here shortly

423
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,669
ninety nine episodes now talk about some
real special

424
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:46,030
I'm gonna do later with really a freak
America his income up

425
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,350
here in a minute and talk about what
what that was

426
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,010
was to him and how he felt what I'll let
him cover it but it's

427
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,129
it's going to be a combination of how he
feels about the show when it was for him

428
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:01,090
what he what what it was he thinks for
the listeners and anything else he likes

429
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:01,730
that

430
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,520
by a revolution I stink dog will be
coming up and speaking

431
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,870
on what he the same thing that for ready
for commerical what he felt about it

432
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,040
I felt its its effectiveness listeners
and stuff like that

433
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,389
pompous he spoke earlier in this room
today actually

434
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,500
default radio which is on

435
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,720
can ever phone related program freaking
phones

436
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,940
also to stuff like that I their

437
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,130
default radio dot com all have dueling
instinctive other your house as well

438
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,460
default daily which is actually default
radio but what they did was get

439
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,270
interesting

440
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,799
and a voicemail box and he would call
every day and leave a ten minute

441
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,000
voicemail just default daily

442
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,400
and you can just call and and and get
your default daily

443
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,700
and a and they did so that's that's one
of the things that they did so it's both

444
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,410
of the following you

445
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,030
and of course is off the hook which
they've been around since I've known as

446
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,510
1988 they had that I think maybe even a
little bit for that before that

447
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,330
before they actually got the shows
recorded and off the hook is a

448
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:07,199
evolution of the hook hit were here that
the whole continent emmanuel goldstein

449
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,700
and they've been a they've been great in
helping people out like kevin Mitnick

450
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,860
you know bernie S a you know that it and
rely on their

451
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,030
I just all sorts of people

452
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,299
arm there have been involved in that
show that that that their

453
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:25,650
their deep in her community and have
made a difference in a lot of things

454
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,100
like technology

455
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,669
our laws for instance we've seen how
laws been abused

456
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:33,880
on these people on how

457
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,490
people like hackers are people that
wanna toy with technology in our curious

458
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,660
have been

459
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,919
mistreated in and and and miss viewed

460
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:46,410
other than then the way they should be
viewed

461
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,270
and that shows been been very critical
in and spreading that word

462
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,600
on who really know I actually had not
heard these people yet

463
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,049
but I wanted a animal leave anybody
outside trying to put some

464
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:01,500
actually did you wanna their shows arm
so they're on their own hacker media

465
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,900
dotnet you can check that out

466
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,690
and DTMF are radio there on Hacker media

467
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,440
dotnet you can check that out and I'm
gonna have do want to step up to the

468
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,710
podium here

469
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,370
and talk about ready for commerical
little bit

470
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,660
persona que slip and a manual and all
the volunteers

471
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,179
for for everything here I'm I'm honored
here

472
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:29,360
there are two reasons why really a big
market at our UK

473
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,890
by the way need find it in on Google
others two reasons why was created first

474
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,320
I couldn't get enough to pack a radio
was listening off the hook

475
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,870
noticing to the now-defunct hacker and

476
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,090
it was enough for me I wanted more so I
went and created it myself but i wanna

477
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,429
sit on my ass

478
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:50,910
one man in which there's another hack a
radio show I went and made one

479
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,000
and and i think that affected the
community right ineffectiveness actually

480
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,720
segways into my second reason

481
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,549
people to create their own shows and and
more radio came a bit

482
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:06,770
the second reason I to paraphrase one of
the

483
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,900
the mostly hackers culture jammers I
know mean

484
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,790
you must take the resources you have and
effect some positive

485
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,990
impact upon your community you must do
that

486
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:24,929
and I wanted to do that as well I wanted
to take the little knowledge I had

487
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:28,950
and shared with everyone else take
everyone's everybody else's

488
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,700
right all the knowledge that that
existed in the community right it wasn't

489
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,190
listeners it was a community

490
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,320
take all their knowledge and share it
with with all

491
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,439
all the others that didn't know about it
I learned more

492
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,910
doing RF a real freak America that then

493
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,030
you know most my time sitting behind a
computer or you know

494
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,668
dying numbers on someone else's phone on

495
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,640
read a few freak America ran for to your
the Rio to do

496
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,100
every report

497
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,029
ninety nine episodes Sabal have special
announcement

498
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:03,870
one of them and II miss it now

499
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,360
every week I wish I had I wish I had
that outlet

500
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,860
I wish I had that interaction with with
the community will help you

501
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,720
every week I dearly miss I hope to do
another show soon

better difference you know more
technologically danced

503
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,990
if i may touch on technology briefly it
takes little to nothing to do

504
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,830
I started on P 133 run in ninety-eight

00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,779
all you need and you can do it and it
does matter

509
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,000
talk about games smack talk about bones

politics you can do it and guess what
people want to listen

511
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,090
I guarantee it now removing up

512

mixing board you know I'm doing on my
Nexus can be Aug we

539
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,200
but I'll talk about the way you know
what more personal

540
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,220
you know I've been on are pay for quite
a while

541
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,450
and then now kinda as we said there's a
need and there's

542
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,910
demand out there I think from looking
across the room

543
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:55,530
people wanna find more information and
and more news from a tax perspective

544
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,370
on I'm friends with these I want I not
only listen to their shows

545
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,550
I listen to the other shows I wasn't
every show on them

546
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,550
every single show I said all day

547
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,990
and headphones in front of code and
listen to the shows all day long

548
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,500
and I still want more it's a it's a it's
a

549
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,940
minutes and it online in United States
relief it's something do all your player

550
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,640
working at Soul it's great to play the
background absolutely soul

551
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,530
I say that to say we want more

552
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,129
we don't it's not like this or listen or

553
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,960
or been read or over later or lesson to
all up

554
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,310
we support all of them were on each
other show and make their own a an

555
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,360
absolutely and

556
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,320
you know I know I can speak personally
and she's got the same contact me

557
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,669
or them I'm sure with questions glad to
help you get the recommendations

558
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,910
on the I'm you can make slight chill

559
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,220
your girls and stuff like country get
all that from us

560
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,640
anytime you want on specifically for
minor revolution radio

561
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,170
on I wanted to show that was more

562
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,210
technical I want to show those more

563
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,140
talking tech from hackerspace
perspective I want to stay away from a

564
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,380
lot of political topics

565
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,780
wanna get into that this directly
related to hacking into something

566
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,740
and people who listen to my show now I
can go on a rant about some mess up

567
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,420
sometimes

568
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,590
on but I try to stay away from that as
much as I can focus on

569
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,240
the tech talk because I think there's a
lot about the shows the cover material

570
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,330
so I want to stick to the technology
aspect

571
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:30,070
things I also like a nice strict form
and I think having regularity

572
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,280
having a pattern of the way you do your
show trying to get to repetitious where

573
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,710
they try to change up a little bit we do
have certain guidelines we follow a hand

574
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,360
famous for the show novels as they call
on the show notes that I make each week

575
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,570
and I spend time researching and that's
what I like

576
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:49,000
about doing the show I spend hours each
week

577
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,360
and like I everybody in this room you
know it's it's last night there's tons

578
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,710
of other sites out there

579
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,470
on you gotta root secure dotnet you can
go to just times I've sites out there

580
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,340
get lots of packing information:
technical information

581
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,900
and we do that anyway well when you find
something interesting there and you're

582
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,290
spending time doing this research

583
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,149
and learning you know you can go on and
we talk about it I have yes

584
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,730
on who have experience in certain areas
and I get focused and yet because I

585
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,760
don't know on an expert on how this that
most my guess come in

586
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,770
and they know what they're talking about
I learn on every show that we do

587
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,600
every single time we do a show I learn
something new people right in with

588
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,340
questions we accept emails

589
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,640
we'll research it will try to finance as
best we can we also forms at the site

590
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,300
which I'm not gonna

591
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,670
campus I too much been red dot com on
but we have

592
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,820
you know I'm fresh like that we try to
interact with the audience because

593
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,970
I want to learn and you got a cool topic

594
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:46,100
like thanks a specific example was amp
or not our cameraman racks they're

595
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,400
turning onto port knocking

596
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,080
what Paul concept that was and I spent
like a week and a half

597
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,130
researching what did cool topic for not
being was in me to put that he's rather

598
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,710
you don't know for not being as big ol
Google for that find out

599
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,940
or listen go check out the archive
search my show no to find the tabs on up

600
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,650
or knocking

601
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:07,120
but I learn from and that's like take
out a show is I get to do research

602
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,690
I get to learn new things and I get to
grow on I can I said in my presentation

603
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,250
earlier

604
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,630
I've been five different universities
I've got almost $200 credit hours

605
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,340
accumulated from all these different
places

606
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,580
I'm a lifetime soon I learned every day
whether it's in the classroom outside

607
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,989
doing my own research and that's what I
like to do about the show I learn

608
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,310
technical stuff I like to try to share
with other people

609
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,690
and hear people's be back so that's
really my angle with with minor

610
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,780
revolution and

611
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,650
we put on the site in red dot com you
can download mp3's no charge

612
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,840
on we're not trying to make my guess is
no charge for any actor

613
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,640
well is no advertising sale advertising
you don't get biased

614
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,830
opinions you know we don't I have to
worry about whether

615
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,699
on you know Microsoft s ads on our show
I can't bash Microsoft all

616
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,250
Alba has Mikes up there's no problems
with their on so you'll have that bias

617
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,570
that you get a lot of other

618
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,720
outlets and as you mentioned some so
thats

619
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,090
come my philosophy on things and we just
finished our first year by the way

620
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:06,190
so we're moving on to your to so ok

621
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,200
ABQ alright

622
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,990
thank you are and the Parmalat a great
points that

623
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,740
going to slide I knew that I would be
kinda doing some of the car because

624
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,830
there's so much did that involve yet
there's no advertising and thats

625
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,210
there's no bias from that are on

626
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:26,240
and just like dole said and Angelia be
the media

627
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,020
that's one other things too as well as
that term you know hackers a voice with

628
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,720
Khan's anything like that

629
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,770
been trying to get the word out on
certain things

630
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,000
other than just talk about their
favorite subjects arm

631
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,060
and that's a great thing that audio can
provide I

632
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,170
for people to to do to do that a lot of
the shows

633
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,970
arm yeah we listen to all the time I
encourage

634
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:52,730
in this is in the end the show bankers
have one out here to to

635
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:56,210
to if you're that interested to get
involved in Craig your own show and

636
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,210
you're really gonna enjoy it we're going
to learn a lot just like

637
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,240
just like we've all set up here it's
going to be.

638
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,470
educational spares it's going to be
you're gonna pitcher

639
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:10,520
guaranteed you're going to grow in a
level of maturity

640
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,440
far beyond any would've just sitting on
your butt all year working in

641
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,210
and and not doing much I'm telling you
that its it's really helped me grow its

642
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,900
helped me

643
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,410
a do a lot of critical thinking tell me
become aware of things

644
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,759
as far as just me being myself as a
human being

645
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,080
but I'm involved in a technical field
myself in the decisions I'm going to

646
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,790
make

647
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,840
while I'm working out there doing the
things I can do my recommendations

648
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,130
to other people based on my knowledge
I'm gonna have a better

649
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,730
understanding I love how these things
impact the world plus also wanna talk

650
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,400
about survival techniques

651
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,420
I'll all this big brother is watching
you and of course she saw the panel

652
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,560
a in the other room on hey if it was
called is the guide as a vehicle

653
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,240
database on everybody

654
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,570
bomb you know stuff like that and that's
good things you need to watch out

655
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,700
as your living in this new world it's
its

656
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,890
its it can be scary at times and you
need to be aware that because a

657
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,009
the media is not going to tell you and
just like to all said

658
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,060
there there well where the media above
the new world because

659
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,340
that is the new world and and they're
not going to tell you

660
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,430
though such things because they are
sponsored by corporations

661
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,290
and the things that everyone needs to be
aware because you can be

662
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,770
you to feel like a victim if something
happens to you

663
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,830
like many other people that have
tinkered with DIRECTV satellites

664
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,220
radio you know Xboxes

665
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,920
anything like that nnnnn come knocking
on your door

666
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,090
and you're like I didn't know that this
was a bad thing I didn't know that

667
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,420
people out there doing these kinds of
things

668
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:49,940
and that's why it's important to spread
the spread the word

669
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,540
what else is out there now this is
something I'm a lead into

670
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,730
that kind among the Virgin up taking off
not quite sure

671
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,390
when it's gonna take off is hacker video

672
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,710
there's been a lot of people over the
years old and video clips

673
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:08,970
and stuff like that there's some
documentaries obviously

674
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,240
freedom downtime is well I consider when
the best

675
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,830
hacker videos out there there's all
sorts videos out there on Linux

676
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,930
open source canoe

677
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,980
I mean even you know the the

678
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,390
the Pioneers a Silicon Valley and and
videos a cover historical events

679
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,580
that happen in the world technology
there is

680
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,500
I guess I could put in and you can read
Act this technology is not the nineteen

681
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,590
hundreds

682
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,490
I mean it's been found back from what
I've read and and and I'm sure it's

683
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,020
totally debatable

684
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,310
there was a the equivalent of what was
considered as a battery in the 16th

685
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,390
century

686
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:50,190
you know but a not going if that's true
or not but technology has been around

687
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,450
here for our building the pyramids

688
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,910
making the wheel you know all that stuff
I but not

689
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,920
you know obviously we're talking about
more current issues today but you can go

690
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,150
back and look at those things but hacker
video something we can do the audio and

691
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,940
video

692
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,500
we are showing things like a
presentation earlier once tank was doing

693
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,340
a presentation

694
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,830
Hughes videos presentation because
actually helped greatly improve

695
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,810
how he could show people what he was
talking about

696
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,130
some the the things are out there is
hacked TV which

697
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:23,460
I mean been read has as a magazine I

698
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,960
they have radio and forums actually is
really

699
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,180
huge and the working on hacked TV just
one episode out

700
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,399
I incurred anybody here go ahead like if
you have some really cool good film it

701
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,440
and could have been red dot com and you
know submit

702
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,960
and and and the it's not just like us
meeting our own content to each other

703
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,960
its anyway it's anybody anywhere and any
country

704
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,510
you know said something into to them
something into the show will make your

705
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,300
own show its

706
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:56,180
it's for everyone I the broken is
actually a new thing I haven't heard the

707
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,279
too much for them but they have a few
episodes government actually a wonderful

708
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,520
.tv is a new thing that's coming off the
ground I'm not sure

709
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,070
I want to bring up summer the I like to
discuss everyone site so many sites are

710
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,140
just beginning like whites or TV

711
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,740

white soared TV dot T K

713
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,940
whites whites were .tk sorry the broken
is the broken at ORD

714
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,350
and actually isn't in red dot org arm

715
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,819
but to sorry in red dot com

716
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,040

717
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,710
deduct even whiter subs kinda new
actually all of them are kinda new but

718
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,890
it doesn't matter I wanna help support
them I

719
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,009
and make it available for people to to

720
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:47,770
to see and and contribute what your
methods and you can spread awareness

721
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:50,910
because it's not just about hacker radio
hack a radio is just

722
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,399
actually I think recently become very
popular off the hook has been around for

723
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,230
ever

724
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:00,590
for a long time but a hacker radio is
just one of the methods are you can do

725
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,470
it acker video and even all those

762
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,900
American

763
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:44,119
where working on now we have some great
great guests lined up

764
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,309
some very very good stuff when

765
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:50,369

really I don't have a schedule but I
assure you that we are working on it now

any other questions out there the
audience racks which you're right

768
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:00,989
actually

769
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:05,709
and will will get you to back there what
do you guys think about peer to peer

770
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:11,359
peer to peer streaming mainstream in
general are just a time a bit torrents

771
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,420
was a your cast

773
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:22,729
yes cascade streaming oh so it it quits
it's a

774
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:26,390
distributed streaming streak play I mean
that sounds

775
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,288
that sounds great to me you know
whatever it takes to it to send it out

776
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:31,499
distributed streaming pure cason or

777
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:36,289
arm sounds like people sharing torrent
stuff like that assuring streams
