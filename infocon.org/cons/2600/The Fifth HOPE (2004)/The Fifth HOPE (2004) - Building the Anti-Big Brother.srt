1
00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:03,679
Peter Wehner speaking about overcoming
Big Brother

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,720
okay I'd like to

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,719
I am Peter Wehner and I would like to
thank everyone for coming I I really

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:12,759
enjoy coming to

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,780
the help conferences because they're
such a crackling unsettled

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,600
kinda intelligence that provides the
place um

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,890
and we're really talking about is kinda
way we can repurpose encryption

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,300
technology to

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,390
build databases that do useful work
without having any useful information in

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,689
them

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,239
and retailer with the building and a big
brother and a little bit about

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,540
flashy spin to it um

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,149
one the other terms I can abuse
described as a

14
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,809
trances and databases and get them a few
minutes so here's kinda the big problem

15
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:46,449
that I think

16
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,660
we have and this

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,730
something I've discussed a lot of people
over the years miss but let me too kinda

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,180
spent some time looking at it and the
problem is that you know you we had

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,109
these databases have this I'm sensitive
information in their bike prescription

20
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,129
records have salary records credit card
numbers schedules

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,229
you information that can be abused in
all these different kind of ways

22
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,689
and the problem is that there are a lot
of weak links and so even though if

23
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:12,880
they're if you are

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,298
the system administrator trying to work
as hard as you can there

25
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,399
lots of problems that are beyond your
means so

26
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:23,630
for a maybe the operating system on your
bill to building your system upon

27
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,560
has holes in it or back door or maybe
the database has a whole

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,450
or sometimes the promised land insider
thats in your organization that's

29
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,580
abusing information and

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,690
this is a real problem people

31
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,479
you know abuse things all the time I was
talking to a friend of mine and he was

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,060
lamenting the fact in 10 weather should
call the police

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,740
because his competitors were in their
offices negotiating some

34
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,539
hard-fought deal on there are getting
very far and well they took a break

35
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:55,060
demands his team decamp to their offices
they left the

36
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,289
competitors in the in the conference
from guys plugged into the network

37
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:02,399
and downloaded that although everything
off their server because these guys

38
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,459
thought well you know no one's ever
gonna break em

39
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,500
so in a physical security is a problem
even when you're inside your parameter

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,590
and so you develop this parameter and
you think that your gonna keep everybody

41
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,879
out you got the firewalls you got this
fortress

42
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,859
and even then you have problems with
abuse inside so

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,290
I start looking at this problem and I
start talking to people

44
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,500
and I was having is to be with this guy
me and he said well you know that this

45
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,040
is just inherent its part

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,700
the way the world is you know if you
want to build the system if you wanna

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,650
if you want to give people services if
you want to keep track in their

48
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,970
prescriptions you want to keep the
credit card on file

49
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,580
so they can do one quick one-click order
if you want to do anything for people

50
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,599
you've got to have these databases and
there's just no two ways about it and I

51
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,859
started thinking about that might start
wondering is that

52
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,010
really true and you know when you kept
playing around with science you start

53
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,390
playing a role in mathematics some time
to come up with a really interesting

54
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,629
results if you can kinda flip

55
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,649
assumptions a.m. on their head and this
is kind of what people did when I first

56
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,530
looked at public key cryptography I

57
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,920
remember talking to real Merkel about
this he said well you know I wondered

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,019
his third any reason why you have to
encrypt with one key and

59
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:17,189
D crib with the same key and he couldn't
for that and so he came up with public

60
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:17,980
key cryptography

61
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,540
and I think that so start looking as I
was running well is there any way you

62
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,209
can get around

63
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,400
and the more I look at tonight's came to
conclusion that you can and you can

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,409
kinda views a lot of the old tech tricks
that are in our bag you just have to

65
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,939
think about using them in a different
way

66
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:34,608
and so I'm gonna try to do is go through
few simple examples

67
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:38,590
that I that I hope will inspire you to
kinda redesign your system's

68
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,420
so

69
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,160
thing kind of have this kind of
translucent nature and what we'll end up

70
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,239
with will be kinda

71
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,370
I think something that's more secure
more useful for everyone

72
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,900
and in his in a sense you can have your
cake and eat it too

73
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,420
so

74
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,819
I i've try to come up with a bunch of
different metaphors for describing how

75
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,520
you can do this and I think the the

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,500
the kinda old school way of designing
your protect your data

77
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,030
is to build this fortress around it and
you know you got your walls you got your

78
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,400
you harden your firewalls best you can
and then you've got

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,780
you know you got your retinal scanners
and you just keep putting all these

80
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,530
layers and layers to protect that one
hard disk and senator

81
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,610
now the way I thought about it is that
maybe you can do all this

82
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,630
without having any useful information on
that hard disk at all

83
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,300
so in essence you are kinda them you not
building a fortress your building is

84
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,389
neutral switch

85
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,520
but doesn't know what's coursing through
it you have this network that's very Dom

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,349
but somehow the people the clients on
the edges the the user's

87
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,010
are going to get the information they
need they're gonna get the services that

88
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,820
they require

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,169
and it's all going to work out so in
essence the information is kinda

90
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:50,500
diffused into this mathematical space

91
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,850
a.m. instead of being kept in one very
concrete physical place which is the

92
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,570
hardest

93
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,680
okay so there there are three different
there five different ways that I've

94
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,680
kinda come up with doing this and
they're all variations on standard kept

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,289
the themes

96
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,840
but they are to scramble to date on
which is to put it through

97
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,020
considered a correction function like a
yes

98
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,740
or two's you know whatever your favorite
encryption function is a rare public key

99
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,400
for that matter

100
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,680
and the second one is perhaps to blur
the data just enough

101
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,140
so instead of completely scrambling it
so it's instant unintelligible

102
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,070
you blur it's so it it's not useful to
people who might abuse it but it still

103
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,440
I'm retains enough for the kinda the
outline that still useful

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,280
for people who want to use it for
legitimate purposes the the third

105
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,150
technique is the kind of camouflage the
data

106
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,669
so only the right person can pick out a
legitimate values

107
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,109
from the fake values the fourth one is
to misdirect the attacker and make it

108
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,260
harder for them to figure out what's
cracked and the fifth one is to split

109
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,870
the data

110
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,669
so these are kind of standard functions
were you can arrange it for the day to

111
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,020
be in two or three or

112
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,990
and different locations and the only way
that an attacker can

113
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,659
arranged to I'm can can abuse
information

114
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:07,390
is if they reconstitute information by
breaking into all

115
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:13,680
and locations at the same time I'm gonna
go through I'm gonna concentrate mainly

116
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,440
on the first couple of them

117
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,000
I think the latter ones are a little bit
more straightforward and so I can't

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,870
cover them in the book I wrote about
this but I don't think they rose

119
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,030
germane to the topic here okay so the
first thing I want to say is that

120
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,580
just designing is kinda transition
databases and translucent databases and

121
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,940
the term I kinda came up to

122
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,740
apply to all of this a.m. is something
of an art

123
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,010
so there are a lot of different
approaches and I think

124
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,659
I could have a debate with many
different people about what's the right

125
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,490
solution to use in one case there

126
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,450
you may or may not want to use different
ones and there's often a trade-off

127
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:54,010
if you too turn up the security you
often turn down the usability or you

128
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,250
kinda you're going to have to kind of
trade these things off and

129
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,710
there's a a lot of fun available to
designers

130
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,400
when they're working through this I
think one of the more interesting

131
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,830
details are kind of that side but I've
often given as talk to Java programmers

132
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,310
because I've always thought the job was
a very useful tool

133
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,450
and is now coming to the we're now
reaching a point where JavaScript

134
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,789
is just as useful if not more useful and
it's a completely different technology

135
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:20,200
but

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,039
if you work at that if you cut a program
to these platforms very easy for

137
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,630
all the work to be done at the client
and all the encryption scrambling to be

138
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,590
done at the client in someone's browser

139
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,810
and by the time it even leaves the
machine it's completely scrambled and

140
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,840
the entire network

141
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,860
is I'm protected you don't need to worry
about putting these firewalls in the

142
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,820
right place you don't need to worry
about

143
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,409
someone getting inside your printer
because there is no parameter it all

144
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:46,580
stops at the browser

145
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,590
occurs to the first

146
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,870
that kinda the first tool that you need
to know about it the first

147
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,740
solution I I think it's pretty much an a
obvious one

148
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,050
but its I founded the PE more and more
useful the more I looked at it now first

149
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,190
are playing with it

150
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,219
and they said well you know that's kind
of interesting and then the more reviews

151
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:07,550
did

152
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,469
I became to realize it's kind of like
duct tape and Ralph Merkle has done a

153
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:12,950
lot of work with hash functions

154
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,330
kinda calls it the cause in the duct
tape cryptography and

155
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,460
that's what I found to you can use it in
an incredibly wide

156
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,419
Rangers places and it does a great job

157
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,190
so the duct tape yours called a one-way
function

158
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,620
and I don't know how much math you guys
know but a one-way functions like this

159
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,260
equation that you can do

160
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,630
in one direction but not the other so if
you think about

161
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,750
kinda elementary school arithmetic you
know how to do addition and you know how

162
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,120
to do subtraction and subtraction kinda

163
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,589
reverses addition so can you try to
imagine that there's going to be some

164
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:47,350
function out there like addition

165
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,890
for which we don't know love a way to go
backwards which is that subtraction

166
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,670
and it turns out that these are exist
the these functions do exist

167
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,779
so that means that if someone gives you
other backs which is how a mathematician

168
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:02,100
my talk about it it's very hard to find
axe

169
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,649
and kinda corollary definition and I'm
going mentioning it scares people are

170
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,339
into math in the audience

171
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,120
is that you know it's very it's also
very hard to find two distinct values of

172
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,839
X&Y so that after back steeples up and
walk

173
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,020
ends for these one-way functions have
lots of practical values

174
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,390
and not only are they hard to reverse
and we're going to use that

175
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,360
difficulty for all over security arena
bass are security on it

176
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,149
but a.m. they also look like random
values and it turns out this is useful

177
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,490
in waterways

178
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,020
I often try to make the claim that these
translucent databases are more efficient

179
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,630
because today um often lay out the
tables better

180
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,100
and the the values are more equally
distributed so the indexing functional

181
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,490
databases cam

182
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,550
work better so I don't know whether
that's

183
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,220
if it's much of an effect but if it's
kind of interesting

184
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,370
so these is one-way functions usually
look complete complete random garbage

185
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,820
that comes out

186
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:05,770
and that can be useful a lot of
different ways

187
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,790
okay let me just say before I go on and
show you an example that their there are

188
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,920
ways that you can have

189
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,439
your you know once again you can have
your cake and eat it too if you want to

190
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,940
have a one-way function

191
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,370
but you sometimes maybe want to go
backwards and you

192
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,820
sometimes want to figure out what
someone typed into that one-way function

193
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,980
you can build them with with with trap
doors and

194
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,019
and this is kinda the original metaphor
that people use to describe publicly

195
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,570
key cog the end its usefulness a.m.
situation too and the only caveat I can

196
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,550
offer you is that

197
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,010
if you put that trap door in there all
of a sudden you have to protect

198
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,540
and you have to worry that perhaps it
might be abused so

199
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,120
a.m. you know we can you can do

200
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,830
everything here and have your back door
if you need

201
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,550
okay so let me talk about the that the
kinda the practical ways that one might

202
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,330
go about

203
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,230
using a one-way function and it turns
out that you can just download some

204
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,910
source code from the web

205
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,680
there's a great function called shot
which the US government bill

206
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,990
and all those some people had some
conspiracy theories about

207
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,800
what these guys are doing in back in the
seventies no one's really found any

208
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,769
problems with

209
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,220
the latest function which is this one
called shop which is short for

210
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,320
I'm secure hash algorithm a.m. now

211
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,029
when I use it on the rest the slides I
just use the word the letter H to this

212
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:25,170
guy does kinda pash

213
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,349
generic hash function but what you do is
that this this function is just a big

214
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,370
blunder

215
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,180
for for data you take your file you toss
it in

216
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,459
and outcomes 20 bytes and those twenty
bites are not going to look like the 20

217
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:39,070
bytes to

218
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,640
you toss and if you put in a slightly
different file and every time you make a

219
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,180
little change in that file

220
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,910
there's there's gonna be a change in the
twenty bites that come out

221
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,029
and the question is how do we use those
20 bytes

222
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,519
so I'm gonna show you some simple ways
you might use those 20 by scum up with

223
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,580
pseudonyms for people

224
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,080
and so these are going to be simple
pseudonyms that you can use in your

225
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,160
database

226
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,269
and I think that there are practical and
useful

227
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:07,080
and yet they protect you know people's
identities or their personal information

228
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,630
so I don't know how many you guys are
programmers but I'll just mention a

229
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,699
feudal details along the way

230
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:16,860
I am in a for implementation reasons you
don't you don't need to keep all 20

231
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,879
bytes that came out

232
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,860
they're they're all equally random you
could just keep the first 4 bytes are

233
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,709
you in the first couple bits

234
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,939
and you can you can toss multiple files
in there and you can arrange things you

235
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:28,360
can concatenate data

236
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,480
and you just pour the whole thing into
the splendor and outcomes this

237
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,769
result and what are the

238
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,709
wanna the kinda features that I like to
use is to put this key

239
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,149
at the beginning ugh every hashing
operation

240
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:45,910
what this does is kinda creates a kind
custom pash function

241
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,469
that only you can generate because only
you know that key so you can kinda keep

242
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,279
these things and

243
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,899
it has some interesting results so

244
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,839
I'm not gonna be able to talk about now
but I you if you have time after a judge

245
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:57,879
asked me about the

246
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,480
was to discuss songs and how you can
hide secret information and justice

247
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,839
custom your favorite discussions using
this technique

248
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,170
okay so now I should give some props to
the people who work in it so the past

249
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,839
midnight when I start looking at this
idea as the concussion at the severe

250
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:13,250
really

251
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,160
Mary great area to do some research in

252
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,769
and it became clear the people have been
looking at this idea in many different

253
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,439
facets over the years

254
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:25,269
and in my mind like the UNIX password
function for the first good

255
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:29,920
a.m. the transition databases that out
there

256
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,160
that's out there so I think many of you
guys probably know it you know how the

257
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,139
UNIX password function works

258
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:39,029
a and are for and for that matter the
ones that are in filtered and tear the

259
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:40,199
Mac OS

260
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,560
and what what the operating system does
is instead of storing

261
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,009
the password itself it stores the hash
the password

262
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:50,860
and what this means if someone breaks
into the lowest level up the operating

263
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,779
system they're not going to be able to
figure out someones password

264
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:58,019
they're just gonna see this kinda random
noise and

265
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,910
I'm gonna show you a few slides how you
can use that to protect people's library

266
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,199
browsing records

267
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:07,100
or you know home their shopping records
or anything like that

268
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,860
and we're just gonna use the same
technique that people have been using

269
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,060
over the years for the

270
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:18,060
for protecting passwords

271
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,350
okay so here's the question is can a
store track with customers by without

272
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,170
spying on them and I'm

273
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:29,550
I have a at nur have it up just
referring to Amazon in this case be and

274
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,150
the reason I

275
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,319
I don't feel I don't wanna pick on
Amazon's I think there really a great

276
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,970
company

277
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,700
a.m. but the reason I end up choosing
them is because I think they have the

278
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,360
most feature

279
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,150
one of the more feature rich
environments out there and they've run

280
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,130
into problems with

281
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,800
privacy advocates because people look at
Amazon again little bit worried because

282
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,320
they say

283
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,390
amazon knows exactly what I bought when
I bought it it does my credit card knows

284
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,790
all this information about me

285
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,689
and I personally think a company like
Amazon should be really worried about

286
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,270
the information it keeps

287
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,550
one of the first times I was teaching a
course on this topic

288
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,130
a.m. I had it was it did end up being a
silver lining visited

289
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,460
I think one of the great examples about
why this kind of technology is necessary

290
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,460
but I came out that morning and my
neighbor's car had been broken into

291
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,310
and someone had stolen his stereo and
then I looked up the street and we kind

292
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,120
of have a communal street where everyone
parks

293
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,960
a.m. my car had also been broken into
and although they tried to steal the

294
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,520
stereo

295
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,000
they didn't get it but I'll tell you
that the class was much more valuable

296
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,370
than her cost much more to replace the
glass and

297
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,450
hysteria would cost to replace so now we
leave our car open

298
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,550
a.m. it but anyway so

299
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,070
so we were sitting there and and you
know I have two kids we have a minivan

300
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,950
and it's an old many band so it it
doesn't it snows cause a manuals

301
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,550
to telephone truck but it's in that
vintage

302
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,590
and so I was thinking why would someone
tried to steal our stereo and then is

303
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,950
talking my friend across the street to
also look up kids and so he just has

304
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,490
driving a Nissan Altima and their some
BMW's down the street in there somewhere

305
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,430
some much nicer cars in the neighborhood

306
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,440
and we're kinda commiserating wonder why
would someone pick on us

307
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,130
and then I remembered that just a few
months earlier he had installed a new

308
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,370
stereo from Crutchfield

309
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,960
and body from Crutchfield and I had
bought a new stereo from Crutchfield

310
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,750
and I thought well that that still
doesn't mean anything cuz how they know

311
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,230
where

312
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,020
you know whose car it was from and then
I remembered if you go to crutchfield

313
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,439
they've got a really nice height

314
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,770
I'm high-touch website where before you
can even order something you have to

315
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,750
tell them what make

316
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,170
and model year cars don't act on the
collar but that can figure that out

317
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,750
and they tell you whether this this
little Meister is gonna fit in your dash

318
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,100
in

319
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,250
so I have no idea what happens

320
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,690
but the most plausible explanation I can
have for why are two cars were the only

321
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,560
ones target on that street is that
there's someone who has access to

322
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,850
crutchfield's database in was selling a
list to people

323
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,180
saying here are some nice new stereos
that are installed

324
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,870
and you know if you happen to know if
you're looking for starters a good place

325
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,380
to go

326
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,439
pick one up so I I tell that story love
times just to motivate that

327
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,730
that these this information in this
database is valuable

328
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,579
everyone says you know well you know
when you care if someone knows what

329
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,550
stereo you bought

330
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,629
but you know I know their costumes
300-400 dollars to replace the glass on

331
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,320
my car

332
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,260
because perhaps the database was in a
secure as it could be

333
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,819
okay so what I've

334
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,139
what I'm proposing is a very simple
solution and I think it it goes a long

335
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,920
way to

336
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,130
solving a lot of problems is instead of
storing information under someone's name

337
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,290
the store that under the hasher the name
so pitchers dares attend a table at the

338
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,540
bottom the kinda looks like

339
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,670
day some store for some crazy

340
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,830
clothes store and you know it is down
here Mueller

341
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,449
Oreo highlighted this is it this is the
hash if the user's name

342
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,320
instead of the user's name so you still
got the other information like what I

343
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,210
bought these touring she knows are
navigating she knows whatever in the

344
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,470
color and the size

345
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,280
but you don't actually have the persons
name itself

346
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,430
now what's the value to that well it
would start thinking about

347
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,330
what you could still do with that
database there are some things you can't

348
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,070
do which is no who bought what where
when

349
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,870
so if first if a stereo store uses to
protect my story records

350
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,950
I would be there's a good chance they
would be able to find out where I lived

351
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,060
if the hash my address but what is true
is

352
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,350
I can come in and I can look at my past
records so it turns out that stereo

353
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,790
in the car has gone bad and I need to
order a replacement

354
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,740
I could go to the website I can still
type in my name

355
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,970
I can compute the hash using JavaScript
or

356
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,340
wherever it is in the browser I compute
the hash and I can look at everything I

357
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,449
bought in the past

358
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,350
so the store still giving me those
services rhyme able to look at my past

359
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,020
orders

360
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,520
I'm able to figure out what was the
serial number for the product I can

361
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,889
I can't deal with warranty servicing but
the store doesn't know my name

362
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,620
and the store can go in the other
direction because we've got this one-way

363
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,470
function

364
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,670
I can compute the one-way function in
the direction it's useful for me

365
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,030
but anybody who's broken into the store
computer can't go backwards

366
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,370
so I think that this is a really useful
feature and I think it would be helpful

367
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,610
for a lot of stores

368
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,720
if they kept their per their information
like this

369
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,720
now

370
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,419
her

371
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,440
yeah I did it the other day the hash
ends up being the key that

372
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,460
that becomes what people use and

373
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,730
what I often do I build something
systems I end up doing hash right at the

374
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,340
browser

375
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,699
so by the time it leaves the browser you
know the name ever your

376
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:43,700
your name never leaves the browser in
the clear so

377
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:55,840
up but we will be we'll get to that in a
few minutes but there there are a number

378
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,389
of different ways you can deal with that
um

379
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:02,409
what he did when he just asked was

380
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,690
you know does this mean that you can't
store something practical like addresses

381
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,070
because you either have to start in the
clear so you can use it

382
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,590
or if you catch it up it means that the
person is going to have to type it the

383
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,289
next time

384
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:15,960
so one other nice features that if you
go to a great great website like Amazon

385
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,429
is that they've got all your address is
stored there and you just say

386
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:23,080
shipment ship it to me here and his
point was well they can't do that for

387
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,399
you anymore because it's all hashed into
gobbledygook

388
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:29,480
um there are other ways you can do it
what you can do is you can end up using

389
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,320
the hash

390
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,629
as a key to encrypt the data so what
what I would propose

391
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:38,149
if I were a power design a website for
another for place like Amazon is

392
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,799
I wouldn't store their address I would
store their address encrypt it with

393
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,340
this happen with a different way a
passion up your name and I can show you

394
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,129
that my site

395
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:49,470
I think about a slide in a few seconds
that shows that but

396
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:52,600
a.m. and that way you will love

397
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,480
you can to crypt at that time and then
once you ship the package

398
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,889
I would suggest that there would be
prudent for the store to delete the

399
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:02,519
information and forget it and

400
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,919
you know if they do if they're
responsible store I think it would be

401
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,929
smart for them to do that may just have
to wait for the customer to come back

402
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:08,970
and log back in and

403
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:13,450
unlock that information Okino

404
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,720
here's what I think is one of the nicer
feature service and a few remember the

405
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,679
table on the last slide is that I

406
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,720
'em I only have stopped the name and the
personal information but in hash up the

407
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,159
data

408
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,710
what people bought and so this means
that the marketing department

409
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,659
is gonna still be able to do its job
they're still gonna be able to look at

410
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,879
this number to see that people bought
you know

411
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:37,049
10 percent small shirts in this one town
in fifty percent large

412
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:40,470
because there are these big demographic
distant differences between the

413
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,379
different towns

414
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:44,429
you know like their a.m. and

415
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,330
in the you can be able to figure out all
this information they're gonna find out

416
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,870
the people bought blue shorts with red
pancer whatever combination that people

417
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,350
do

418
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,919
be but they're not gonna see the
personal information behind it so

419
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:57,419
they're gonna be able to aggregate it
they're gonna come up with all this data

420
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,919
that they're gonna be able to use to
plan for the future

421
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,139
but they're not going to have the
personal data attached to it that can be

422
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:03,809
abused

423
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:06,830
and so I think that's that's kinda be
useful feature

424
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,049
because it's always the marketing
department which is the kinda the that

425
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:14,220
big brother with a smiling face cuz are
saying ok my we we were just doing this

426
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,529
for marketing purposes rock to sell it
at cetera

427
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:21,230
and they're one of the big forces behind
collecting all this information

428
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,809
so I think what are the ideal things as
if you can develop these systems

429
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:28,320
in a way that doesn't cut them off at
the knees they're gonna be happy

430
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,830
because you know they can do their job
without taking as much criticism for

431
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:39,830
you know spying on people

432
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:50,080
arm you mean sir

433
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,500
well it I don't know if I have a slight
for this but when I talk before they're

434
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,860
about the five different principles and
the the second one was boring it just

435
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,350
enough

436
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:01,020
me one thing you can do is you can keep
just zip code instead of the address

437
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,060
which often helps which is often what
you need

438
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,070
or you could have shot I mean you can
their lot two different games you can

439
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:15,070
play

440
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,580
yeah

441
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:25,580
min

442
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:28,659
right i think thats why I think that's a
very good attacking what he's pointing

443
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:29,399
out as

444
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:33,519
wanna the one other weaknesses with what
I just show you when I'm gone about two

445
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,389
refer to the next slide I'm solve that
problem honest it's not a plan a.m.

446
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:42,090
so what would a pharmacy do let's
imagine that we've got we're gonna

447
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,259
kinda increase the level of security her
number for a member gonna talk about

448
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,169
this being kinda trade-off between
usability and security

449
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:53,309
so people just type in the name what he
when he made a very good point is that

450
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:53,649
you know

451
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:56,289
maybe someone's gonna do a dictionary
attack is going to be a phone book

452
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:58,919
attack to take all the names from your
small town

453
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,679
and they're gonna port port through the
hash function and eventually they're

454
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,529
going to figure out

455
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:05,779
who that was that bought something and

456
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,009
so you know in order to just might
motivate the site i'd

457
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:12,269
imagine the question of what would a
pharmacy do and

458
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:15,369
you know again I think a pharmacy has
problems has a lot of problems with

459
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:18,589
drugs because people want to steal a lot
of these drugs that are out there and

460
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:22,739
many have a legitimate drugs also kinda
have this new will illegitimate usage

461
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:26,299
because they have the his time narcotics
like oxycodone and what people want to

462
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,700
do is they want to crush them up and
take them all at one time

463
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,929
um so the information in the pharmacy
database is very valuable

464
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,379
a.m. to and also very subject to abuse

465
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:44,629
so what I'm suggesting that case is you
had a ship both the name and a password

466
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:49,119
so you might give someone a pin or a
password and so then what happens is

467
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,259
your database look something like this
and it looks very similar to last

468
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:52,989
database

469
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:56,589
and it looks just like the same kind of
gobbledygook that we saw before

470
00:24:56,589 --> 00:25:00,519
is in this column this is the key column
but if you notice the topic got the

471
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,539
that this is the hasher the name
concatenated with the password so if

472
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:07,239
if you're a pharmacy customer what you
do is you type in your name and then you

473
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,639
have to type in the password

474
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:11,769
so this makes it a little bit less
useful because remembering all the

475
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:13,820
passwords is kind of a pain in the neck
for people

476
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,570
but it makes it possible for someone to
just kind of take the phone book

477
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,499
and start hashing up names they come
across so

478
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:24,879
this is a way to deal with that kind of
problem and I think it's a

479
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:28,679
I think it's a okay solution and I think
you might even be able to prove a theory

480
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,119
about why you have to have this

481
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:34,309
secret password now you notice that
there's there's still some things at a

482
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:35,599
pharmacy can do with this

483
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,749
database you can look for drug
interactions of the guy comes in and

484
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:41,259
he's going to be buying oxy cotton and
Prozac

485
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:45,409
and let's say that that person is I know
nothing about pharmacology

486
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:48,549
but let's say that's a dangerous
combination the

487
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,720
the pharmacy can still look and say hey
wait a second is guys taking this and

488
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,989
he's taking the other is taking his
other drug and maybe

489
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:58,389
this guy should be taking both at the
same time in a can

490
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:02,249
they can kind of police a.m. how people
are using their drugs are making sure

491
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:03,909
that there are many dangers combinations

492
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:08,200
but they don't have the kind of
information they don't have the kind of

493
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,619
personal information stored

494
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:13,179
a.m. attached to it now one other things
wanna lick

495
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:16,429
objections that people have often have
to the solution I have for firms is this

496
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:17,190
it will look you know

497
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,229
they have federal regulatory obligations
they have to keep track of the names

498
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:24,929
they have to know that this prescription
for oxycontin went to Bob Jones on this

499
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:25,359
day

500
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,369
and i'd I think that's a very good
objection it's a very practical problem

501
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:30,210
for pharmacies

502
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,539
but one of the ways that you still might
use this technology

503
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:37,349
is are as a satellite data base so in
many cases there are

504
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:40,849
you too many to a pharmacy has many
chain or branches

505
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,428
so that branch the filling the
prescription may keep it a kind of a

506
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:48,019
a translucent version of the database
and they don't have to spend a lot of

507
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:48,909
extra money

508
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:52,829
on security for that small database at
that location

509
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:56,460
but they may have a hardened location at
their at their

510
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,359
say corporate headquarters where they
actually keep the information that they

511
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,668
would give to the DEA

512
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:07,669
if the DEA was doing investigation
somebody so

513
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,770
well i mean to you I mean there there
are some dangers and there's

514
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,120
I mean my feeling is that a.m. the

515
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,890
II like I said that then all of a sudden
we have the problem of dealing with

516
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,500
passwords

517
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,570
his actual america prepares question

518
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,840
he was saying what about the
administrative overhead of dealing with

519
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,700
the passers I'm

520
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,390
and I think that's absolutely a problem
and there's nothing

521
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,700
unfortunately I don't have a great
solution for and I don't know if anyone

522
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,500
else does

523
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,240
a.m. you need to have this secret if you
want people have some kind of leverage

524
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,650
over their control and I don't

525
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,830
I don't know a practical way up storing
these things

526
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,610
so that that you can deal with forgotten
passwords

527
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,490
so I think it's a it's a question that
you made me want to deal with

528
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,230
in kind of a hybrid system where you
have a locked-down

529
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,820
system where you keep someone's password
in the clear and use

530
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,610
have a kind of a low grade system where
you do most of the work and

531
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,640
you use a hash version there no

532
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,260
if you go back to say that C 1998 1999 I
was talking my wife and she said her

533
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,200
friend said you know

534
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,750
this internet things great what you
really need is some system where you log

535
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,200
into someone's database

536
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,460
ever you go to some web site will tell
you which your baby sitters is going to

537
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,390
be free on Friday night because

538
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,480
in her mind this was her biggest hassle
was figuring out you know who was

539
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,679
actually gonna be available on Friday
night and I started thinking

540
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,460
this is a hundred million dollar idea
maybe a billion-dollar idea we can I P O

541
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,190
this and

542
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:45,080
for months and will be really rich I am
but it turns out that there are

543
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,750
that is actually completely the opposite
that because babysitting is not a very

544
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,850
well rewarded

545
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,159
a profession and

546
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,390
so the BBC's don't actually have a lot
of money to support this kind of me

547
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,630
website if it was a if it were up there
and

548
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,010
there there's also a problem with this
kind of website in that it's got a lotta

549
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,190
really dangerous information they're
they're the schedules a fifteen year

550
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,230
olds in there

551
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,990
there's the schedules parents are gonna
be out of town units very very sensitive

552
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,000
information

553
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,500
on one hand but it doesn't have much
economic value on the other hand because

554
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,309
the

555
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:21,190
the business and industry that's driving
this you know can't really support

556
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,110
a high-grade security solution so the
more I started thinking about this

557
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:25,850
unrealized

558
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,980
you know I don't know if I want to have
a database with all the you know the

559
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,640
locations are these fifteen-year-olds me
what if I got hacked

560
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,370
and you know what if it was abused by
some insider it would be

561
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,210
this would be an enormous responsibility
and so I started realizing you know

562
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,440
maybe there's a way that you could do
this translucent Lee and I think there

563
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:42,850
is

564
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,280
I think what you can do is you can build
these kind of systems and ima try to

565
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,260
show you were two different tables here
how you might build a simple version of

566
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,570
this

567
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,149
and the database itself will have no
personal information

568
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,130
but the parents will still be able to
find out which are the babysitters are

569
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,309
are free and the baby sitters will be
able to control which parents see their

570
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:02,750
schedule in which parents down

571
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,380
so the babysitters wanna turn somebody
offer turn someone on that can do that

572
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,750
and effective even be able to show two
different schedules to two different

573
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,490
parents if they like someone in

574
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,919
better or someone pays more they can be
free a lot more opened

575
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:19,110
there are more often for them so let's
imagine a typical

576
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:23,419
way this would work there that the top
table here kind of shows

577
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:27,360
a.m. when someone might be free and when
they're busy

578
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,720
and so a babysitter would be putting all
these love entries into the table and

579
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,100
they would

580
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,380
hash out their name and their personal
password so love the

581
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,960
um and

582
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,190
in this would be just kinda pissed
generic table I would be indexed by

583
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,840
their

584
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,990
the hash to their name and the password
hotel when they're free and when they're

585
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,280
busy in the question is house apparent
going to be able to use this

586
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,658
so what's up with the sitter my do is
the center keeps us the second table

587
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:57,770
and the center put sentries that that
lets parents

588
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,240
its figure out which is there a.m. you
know with what's the right name

589
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,799
the key that you need to go into the
database you can use database joint so

590
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,960
apparently I do is the parents gonna
typing their name and their password

591
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,649
and hash it up and send it off to the
database the database will say

592
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:16,610
you know oh you're 752 ABB whatever

593
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,840
you you are authorized to see the
schedules ok thats 9829

594
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,470
FFB and also the a4 nine to be

595
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,610
so this parent whoever the 7525 guy

596
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:31,850
air girl is can then see these these two
centers in their schedules

597
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:36,070
and then you the database for just to
imagine find out that 9828

598
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:40,370
at the FDA is busy on April 2nd but

599
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:45,289
the you know 8492 is it's free on that
first in the third

600
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:49,200
so that would be how a a parent could
use a system like this

601
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,450
and the more I play with us the more I
realize the studies hash functions

602
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,690
really are like duct tape

603
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,760
you can start hashing this a hashing
that and you could build up these

604
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,250
arbitrarily arcane

605
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,260
kinda systems and they have you know it
you have to be a little careful how you

606
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,440
do it because you can

607
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,360
you know you can end up being too clever
but I still think that this is a

608
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,460
a nice elegant way of solving a solution
where you need real high grade nuclear

609
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,250
weapons like security for database but
you don't have that much money to

610
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:17,280
support it

611
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,580
so you can build the systems and I claim
that you could leave these tables in the

612
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,439
clear

613
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,790
and you don't have to worry about it too
much

614
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:31,790
yep

615
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:41,389
back

616
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,670
yeah i think thats a challenge I don't
know if I give a longer version this

617
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,920
talk I have a slide that started to in
fact I think I have a slide

618
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,390
like three slides from now like and try
to remember if I left it in or not

619
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:57,030
but did their you kind of clean it up
the same way the database you would if

620
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:00,020
you're doing a very regular data if
you're running the database for regular

621
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,760
reason because

622
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,670
you still have to worry about matching
and the kinda keyword matching

623
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:07,870
so you know what what the database users

624
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:11,080
the developers have is there is
canonical form for them I say

625
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,370
last name come up first name middle
initial and they may delete all the

626
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,360
mister and missus

627
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,410
and they may for instance even put
everything in uppercase

628
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:26,410
to deal with cases use

629
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:33,599
oh my I think if you if you deal with
collisions and yet

630
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,668
you have the same kind a problem you
would with the database in any case so

631
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:41,719
if if you end up running his babysitter
service and you've got to Chris Brown's

632
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,649
them you know Chris Brown has two I'm

633
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:50,969
actually know it if crafted to Chris
Brown's don't use

634
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:54,509
the same password then they're not gonna
hasher the same value

635
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,579
and c2 really don't have it what are the
new what a neat things is when you start

636
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:01,499
hashing the name and the password
together into one pilot gobbledygook

637
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:05,339
then you you lose the prior you you
don't you avoid a lot of the problems

638
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:05,989
with

639
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:10,539
name collisions which are kinda common
in the namespace so

640
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:13,039
I mean what are the other kinda classic
problems that we have out here let me

641
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:13,919
move on to the next

642
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:20,918
what

643
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,859
I'm you you can

644
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,560
the II tho

645
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,830
I mean when I don't really necessarily
mind doing that because I mean

646
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:35,360
okay maybe you can have ten thousand
records your database but I think

647
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,429
changing a key

648
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,120
are you doing it doing inserter an
update on a day-to-day to disable is not

649
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,409
that bigger problem I think I I think
you're right it is a price you have to

650
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:44,899
pay an efficiency and it makes

651
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,040
it's a little bit harder to do that it's
not going to be just one place where you

652
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,290
can do it you can actually have to
update a lot a break if you if you look

653
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:51,889
at the big day

654
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:56,049
the babysitter example in the babysitter
happens to have 10,000 items from her

655
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,070
you know Palm Pilot look uploaded in
your database you are going to have to

656
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,120
do an update on all those ten thousand
records but

657
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:10,120
you know

658
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,790
no I don't mean I don't think what I
don't think people change the password

659
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,329
that often and I don't think

660
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:17,619
a.m. you not gonna have to update the
entire table you're just gonna have to

661
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:18,770
update their entries

662
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:23,220
and you know I don't perhaps I'm being a
little bit cavalier about it but you

663
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,880
know the new

664
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,650
for what you can get with the seven
hundred dollar server these days I

665
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,109
really don't worry about it too much

666
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:31,819
I mean really you can like you can keep

667
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,770
the the entire flight schedule and you
could you can run a reservation service

668
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,300
for

669
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,430
say Southwest Airlines and

670
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,790
keep maybe like 10 bytes for every see

671
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:47,410
on every flight for a year and put it
all in RAM in a couple gigabyte ceramic

672
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,509
for gigabyte ceramic I actually kinda
did the calculation you have to be

673
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,640
careful how you package

674
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,790
but you know it's conceivable that you
can run everything

675
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,079
you know you can run in a tire airline
in RAM so that's why I'm

676
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,220
VIII I'm not too concerned about your
problem although I will concede that it

677
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,470
you know it's it's a problem

678
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,619
efficiency when you start doing this
because let me show you this other

679
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:11,970
act that you can do so the question is
you know

680
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,180
there's been a lot of debate about
whether people can go to libraries and

681
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,109
and find out who's taking what book from
the library and obviously there's a big

682
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:23,310
problem because al Qaeda might come in
here and try to blackmail servicemen or

683
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:23,849
something by

684
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,130
reading you're finding out what they've
been reading and so a lot of librarians

685
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,240
have been trying to fight terrorism by
destroying library records and things

686
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,800
like that

687
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,349
but what are the problems they have as
they say you know we can destroy them

688
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:37,599
after people return the book but we need
to kinda keep the record just to make

689
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,569
sure they bring it back

690
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:41,599
just because unfortunately people abuse
libraries

691
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,380
and that's a good point so I started
thinking is there a way that you might

692
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,339
be able to

693
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:50,230
do it make this a little bit better with
using some hash functions

694
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,430
and so I can imagine these other Tate
database tables you might have

695
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,419
so you you can imagine like there's the
James Moore sunday works for american

696
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,260
express

697
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,020
a.m. and he takes out some books with
the with the library

698
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,300
might stores instead of storing that the
books

699
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,630
title that would store the book's title
and password and

700
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,680
the replacement cost so the star James
Morrison is on the hook for twenty six

701
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,480
dollars

702
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,640
in Tilly brings back this book and they
would take the book and they would look

703
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,549
at it and they would

704
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,170
pash the title and maybe maybe they
would include a passer maybe they

705
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:21,579
wouldn't

706
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:24,859
and then if that's the case then James
Morrison's obligation would be

707
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,299
discharged and they would lead

708
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,040
and if he didn't bring it back by the
dayton there's no date in this table but

709
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,849
you can put 1n

710
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,750
a.m. they were just send a bill or they
were bills credit card or they would

711
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,430
deal with

712
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,680
you know upon return books as they do
now so I think this is kinda neat

713
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,710
feature because

714
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,230
the the library can to protect these
personal records without

715
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,240
a.m. without keeping detailed records of
what people are reading

716
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,530
your yeah why would be

717
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,220
mister morrison

718
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,730
well here just type it in when is
returning the book in it would be hashed

719
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:07,730
and then

720
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,620
know that you know that they can stay
still have his mister morrison's name

721
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,950
and they know he's on the hook for
twenty six dollars they just don't know

722
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,160
what book he is reading

723
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,960
so he couldn't be blackmailed and she
could which is what they're trying to

724
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,460
protect

725
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,620
so they can still done in for the 26 box
and the way he discharges obligation is

726
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,609
to bring the book back

727
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:29,130
and types as password they hash it they
say all you brought back 787 to be

728
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,540
I remember chapter 7 was not great I am

729
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:39,540
okay now you have one back there

730
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,600
omitted that's a perfectly fair one
that's why I suggested putting the

731
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,580
password so

732
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,060
if you want to have make the library a
little more friendly but less secure

733
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,400
you only just hash the book titles and
if you

734
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,810
if you wanna make it more secure than
you haz mister morrison's password in

735
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:08,810
with it so again it's that try to trade
off I was talking about

736
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,180
yeah I suppose so some but you know they
perhaps you can have a

737
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,730
a new-fangled one if you want to go
relate type in a pin code

738
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,250
drop it in I think I think it really
depends how much you care about people

739
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,230
browsing records

740
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,860
but I think that this is still a very
practical system a.m.

741
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,590
but if you want to be really secure you
have to go to like you points out a

742
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,580
little bit more

743
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:35,650
arcane like and if you want to if you
really want even protect people's names

744
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:36,610
and you don't even want

745
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,750
the people to know that they're in there
you can you can extend this even further

746
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,350
and you can start hashing up their names
and passwords to

747
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,160
and you just keep the replacement cost
and so when they show up they actually

748
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,040
have to type in their name and password
and present the book

749
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,740
to discharge their obligations I think
the downside with using a table like

750
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,040
I've got here on the bottom

751
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,050
is that the what the people have to do
is they have to put up a bond

752
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,120
where you know that if you want to get
this book you have to put up some bond a

753
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,799
fourteen dollars and then you get the
fourteen dollars back to bring back the

754
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:09,800
book

755
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,450
yeah

756
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,580
that's a good that's a good point I mean
if you was just depends

757
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,670
you know whether the guy wants to get to
the get it off as get the 26 dollar

758
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,840
charge of its back

759
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:28,400
because return

760
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,480
well it's it you know that is a good
point is you know he you may not

761
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,560
you type in your pin number that time
but you may come back later

762
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,960
and you type in your pin number later to
discharge obligation you know we've got

763
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,320
about 15 minutes here and I've got a few
more slides

764
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,590
how about if I try to speed through man
they will have some

765
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,550
we have five minutes I'm sorry um so

766
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,550
this was the slide I talked about where
he asked the question about

767
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,510
what you do about people having the same
name or type in a name differently each

768
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,380
time and I was

769
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,250
the solution is a canonical form I
talked before

770
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,080
I'll mention as I briefly as
quantization which kind of his a

771
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,930
a fancy technical term for an abstract
way I've always handling

772
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:13,060
just keeping the zip code or kinda
coming up with one

773
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,549
um one point inside a set that refers to
all the sites

774
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:20,700
for the entire set I'm one of my
favorite ways of doing this issue some

775
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,780
steganography

776
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,050
and what you can do with the databases
you can kinda in essence have to debate

777
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,890
databases that are mixed in one

778
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,620
to the the the the example I always use
for this is that

779
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,310
you might have a ship's location with
the you may want to provided

780
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:40,570
incorrect or inaccurate ship's location

781
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:44,960
to people like family members or you
know the general public

782
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,000
but you want the supply ships and the
people who really need to deal with the

783
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,810
ship to know the exact location

784
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,060
so there's some ways you can use some
steganography to hide both in the same

785
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,990
database and I could tell you that later

786
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,170
used of questions I am

787
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,230
I like the idea of mixing in fake data's
where there's a digital signature that

788
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,170
tells you which ones are real and fake

789
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,760
the I'm so this is the

790
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,300
the final slide which is that I think
one-way functions cantors destroyer

791
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,690
infrared destroy data without destroying
all the usefulness you can still test

792
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,350
the quality

793
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:20,170
and Jenna finding the right amount noise
in the way you deal with this is kind of

794
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,100
an art and as

795
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,840
as that people have asked questions
pointed out you know there are these

796
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,260
kinda trade-offs along the way

797
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,980
so I still want to kind of make the
point that I think that information's

798
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:35,070
abused frequently by insiders and and
people who break in an attacker's

799
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,070
and so I think that there's a reason why
legitimate businesses intelligence

800
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,730
agencies and people collect this data

801
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:43,790
should really think about just what they
have there and whether there's a way

802
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,060
that could do a translucent Lee

803
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:49,060
okay so does anybody have some more
questions at the end I guess we have

804
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,670
like one or two more minutes maybe

805
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:57,670
maybe one question going green has asked
tonya her

806
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:09,140
her

807
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,180
um you couldn't you can maintain that I
guess in a different table that doesn't

808
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,460
have a name attached to it

809
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,560
um so you know it

810
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,620
you just have one bit that marks whether
book the book is in or out

811
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:23,880
and then you know and then you have the
other one know the guy behind you and

812
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,390
black

813
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:31,390
understand how you're going to end up
having the baby sitter

814
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,920
side which parents see them for the
parents knowing

815
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,030
which babysitter with the babysitter in

816
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,240
the I can explain this more you later
the babysitter with the

817
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,290
the babysitter would be in charge of the
second table the ones on the bottom

818
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,610
so that if the babysitter it if you came
to me and said I want you to sit for my

819
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,390
kids and I said yes to be cool

820
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,830
you say well here's my name and my
password and I'd say great

821
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,440
and I within I would then go to my
computer and i wouldst give you access

822
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,550
by putting that entry in a bottom you
know that read about in Table

823
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:09,550
what city over here

824
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:19,450
collecting any doesn't recall or won't
fess

825
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:23,060
losing said am what do you suggest

826
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,859
as the like the final act that I was we
were thinking that

827
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:32,509
a good possibility would be to have long
list about the books that are out have

828
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,910
like after a certain amount of time
having gone to a different list that has

829
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:36,940
a trail back

830
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,119
or to have an independent computer that
has

831
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:43,830
a record at the people and the bus
that's not on the network also that you

832
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,130
know

833
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,119
they're locked down everything that you
yeah I mean I think you guys think all

834
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,310
the solutions are good

835
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:52,910
and we wrapped and everything here but
the some

836
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,279
I i think you can do all those things
and that the first problem that you

837
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,060
suggest I think it's just a generic
problem having a library

838
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,560
people can always just about taking
taking a book out so yes just because

839
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,880
you've got a record in your library that
says Peter Wehner took out this book

840
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,119
two weeks ago I can always say well yeah
I didn't

841
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,640
and that the plywood so you're who you
fooling we've got

842
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,118
you know we don't make mistakes and then
it becomes a new said she thinks

843
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,910
said thing am I I think I think you're
right it's a a practical problem in a

844
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:21,910
few cases but

845
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:26,330
you know I think you to say look if
you're taking

846
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,859
you know our records are are solid
record-keeping

847
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:34,890
solid we don't make mistakes you know or
you could just be kind

848
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,440
you know forgive it because you want to
call it kinda depends I guess but

849
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,750
I think you're right okay so if anyone
else has more questions you know please

850
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,010
come up to me afterwards

851
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,030
if the if you're if you're really
interested in it own

852
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:50,200
D's a boil below the stuff down to a
book which you can get from Amazon

853
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,580
and you know this was is kind of ironic
I am

854
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,140
but I i do push them to try to from

855
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:00,609
to try to do something about this so
maybe maybe they've read it there I

856
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:01,089
don't know

857
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:04,630
I talk to someone claims that their uses
idea so we'll see

858
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:09,230
but you should I'm check it out there's
a website if you'd read my web page is

859
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,960
that there are a lot of practical
examples what you can get for free

860
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,240
and it's got a large avocado so thank
you very much for being a wonderful

861
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,099
audience and having such great D

862
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:17,630
inside
