1
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:04,190
now I

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,240
heard a rumor I don't know if it's true
that we may have some

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,870
Free Software Foundation people here
today which i think would be great

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,690
because

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,180
arm they they may have some questions

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,390
that word happy to answer and I I think
that'll even

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,480
liven things up a little bit more a if
Richard Stallman arrive in mobile and

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,330
happy to be here

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,670
I do wanna know about it in advance
because I'm happy answering questions

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,030
from people were up to 10 times smarter
than me but Richard governor

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,590
a whole lot smarter than that so I
expect their questions will be expert

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,540
especially challenging if they happen to
be here

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,170
and let me tell you why just about any
questions from

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,730
free software people are free software
through CS are fair game

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,030
and in any questions okay that you have
later on

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,630
and it's because I deserve the hard
questions the reason I deserve the hard

17
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,830
questions is because I've spent enough
time

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,820
overtime in various for asking exactly
the same kind of questions about

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,549
different kinds

20
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,620
speakers as an example

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,180
a few years ago ed in American Bar
Association convention

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,800
Chris painter from the the justice
department was there along with some

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,840
his colleagues I'm telling us about how
they

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,670
there in the businesses saving corporate
america's six billion dollars a year

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,470
worth

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,010
losses from software piracy in piracy of
other kinds of media

27
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,310
here in the united states and an
overseas and

28
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,420
first question that that represented
mister painter and his colleagues is

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,730
so in giving us those numbers I've you
know how much the losses are

30
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:48,110
are you assuming that every copy made
even in a poor country like China are

31
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,830
or over in iran or someplace like that
that everyone is a lost sale

32
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,810
there's a copy six hundred dollar
database program

33
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,310
that that that's automatically a lost
sale the answers

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,580
yes oh that's a realistic assumption

35
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,270
arm and are you also assuming that

36
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,579
when people copy software

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,000
their is I Knoll

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,780
economic benefit no net economic or
social benefit

39
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,980
from the copy unless there's a payment
made for it isn't the real question

40
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,290
how we're dividing up the games the
trade when copies are made well that's

41
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,530
not a very nice question

42
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,260
arm

43
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,599
another another story that I direct like
to relate

44
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,019
is in another life I i did. actually
work for the Justice Department as an

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,230
assistant US Attorney

46
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,630
and went down to their training center
down in South Carolina

47
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,510
for a computer crimes seminar and

48
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,079
there on on a big screen their their
version of the big screen

49
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,209
are mark I can wyler from the justice
department put up

50
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,459
a big image before one of his speeches

51
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:06,800
showing this gigantic college scholar
with the big cross behind in all kinds

52
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,170
of red colors and

53
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,470
I you know looks really amazing

54
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,359
arm and

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,780
basically that that image and stories
about 2600

56
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,910
and the cult of the dead cow where the
the booger booger they used to scare

57
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,549
all love the the your baby a USA's

58
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,700
and about half the audience for people
from the military

59
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,520
about all the dangers a pack hacker -ism

60
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,030
and the hacker community arm

61
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,349
the the other remarkable thing about

62
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:46,720
that presentation is that I can wyler

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,530
basically spent a long time showing us
the wonders

64
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,980
visual traceroute and what a remarkable
tool that is an

65
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,550
most the audience was pretty amazed the
that such a piece of software existed

66
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,510
which point I i realize you know these
government people don't really know all

67
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,329
that much about what they're talking
about

68
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,650
and all but the CDC people are pretty
damn cool

69
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,379
arm

70
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,739
during that conference I it took the
time to ask one of the

71
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,900
the people the justice department so if
UD

72
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,009
computers in the United States are
attacked by go an enemy abroad

73
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,120
in you hack back

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,330
now if and you do it without the
approval Bajaj

75
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,930
with that mean that that whoever's doing
the hack back even if they're in the

76
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,740
government

77
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,490
would be violating a criminal statute
the answer is yes

78
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,520
the people from the pentagon didn't like
that

79
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,979
they they started shouting all quite
kinds of things about National Command

80
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,349
Authority in

81
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:57,449
other words that that the civilian
lawyer like me is never heard about

82
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,650
before

83
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,759
and Anna have actually done the same
thing on occasion even that a panel here

84
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,550
at age 2 k2

85
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,990
I remember pointing out a couple years
ago

86
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,529
there there's at least a tangential
relative

87
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:20,800
correlation between %uh the costumes
worn by

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,949
a hacker types

89
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:28,650
in courtroom proceedings in the outcomes
that they've received and sometimes it

90
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,619
helps

91
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:34,249
to pick your battles and and where it I
sometimes in court

92
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:37,949
if you really want to persuade the judge
that your legal position is right

93
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:41,330
fight about the law don't fight about
don't fight with the man about

94
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,869
who's going to a retired home

95
00:05:44,869 --> 00:05:47,960
the needless to say I think that was
about as well received as

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,109
questions about copyright by Chris
painter

97
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,129
arm now before getting on farther with
the talk

98
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:00,399
let me make a plug for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation

99
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,759
and I mean think a lot of other people
have

100
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,619
have made very similar plug here arm

101
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,849
especially if you personally call on
them

102
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:14,619
to provide some sort of assistance or
help

103
00:06:14,619 --> 00:06:17,960
make sure to make a contribution for for
what that help is

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,378
is worth in terms of their time arm even
if

105
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,139
even if you don't call on them this year
for some kind of help

106
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,449
support anyway because what the sooner
or later you're gonna need it

107
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:33,389
and the most important thing for god
sake don't wait until the last minute

108
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,360
to call them are just earlier this week
I'm one of the attorneys in their

109
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,499
network that

110
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:43,240
receives referrals from the Electronic
Frontier Foundation

111
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,279
and I got a call on Wednesday from
somebody say I've got a really bad

112
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,558
trademark problem

113
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:52,889
by as well I'm in the middle of the
deposition right now and

114
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,719
I can I really can't answer your
question I can take a lot of time to do

115
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:58,179
that but I am gonna be in New York where
you are

116
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:02,179
on Friday can we meet than is answered
well on Thursday I've got to meet with

117
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:03,949
the other side

118
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,189
saner calling the day before

119
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,819
please make sure to give the lawyer
who's going to help you

120
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:13,999
enough lead time to understand the case
and to give you good legal

121
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,589
representation if you do need help on
anything

122
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:22,289
arm now

123
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,289
moving on to the cult of the dead cow
and and what they're doing in terms of

124
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,899
up hacktivism and getting software out
there to promote human rights

125
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,689
I another one of the interesting
questions that

126
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:38,580
I've asked on their behalf for this was
shortly after they contacted me and said

127
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,359
wave like we've got this really great
piece a software it contains

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,569
strong corruption is going to enable
people in China to communicate

129
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,749
I'll pass the firewall and this and the
other thing I said all that this really

130
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:52,669
terrific but have a strong encryption

131
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:55,909
you've got an export control problem and
I'm I'm sure the most people in the

132
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,990
audience here

133
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,360
know how the US government has used
export controls

134
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,779
as their major means of regulating
strong encryption technology

135
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,949
so question that I asked missus while
the bush administration is in charge of

136
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:11,879
the Commerce Department

137
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,419
is well can the people who wrote back
orifice

138
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:21,469
please have permission to exports strong

139
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,119
stronger than tripled the ass I think
it's in a year system

140
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:29,279
a yes encryption over the Internet

141
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:35,360
surprisingly the answer was yes

142
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,849
and

143
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,740
that yes answer i think is illustrative
love

144
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,470
I mean a lot to the talks here assume
that the government is sort of a

145
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,230
monolithic entity

146
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,320
that's not entirely true

147
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,130
arm there are a lot of good people who

148
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,380
when you work with them inside the
government are willing to

149
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,550
advance your goals or in in my case my
client's goals

150
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,540
are even if you might think that the
administration proper

151
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,939
would not sure those goals at all Munich
X export a strong encryption by a hacker

152
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,820
organization

153
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,930
doesn't seem to be something that the
Bush administration be interested in

154
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,150
arm and had it gone to the level of Don
Evans

155
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,270
Don Evans is now the Secretary of
Commerce

156
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:34,829
he is a gentleman who actually is in the
same prayer group with george bush

157
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,080
me you know you know that the prayer
group really say all that stuff that the

158
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,850
jesus said about

159
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,710
blessed are the peacemakers and helping
the poor people and things like that

160
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,090
that's that's all much nonsense

161
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,490
but done it done and George pray
together a lot about

162
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,640
about you know how not to help the poor
people

163
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,310
if it got to the Don Evans level yeah we
probably have a problem

164
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,920
but most to the people in the Commerce
Department most the people in the state

165
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,020
department

166
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,140
our career officials I and a lot of them
are very sensible people

167
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,270
and in serve just going ahead and

168
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,689
and exporting the software are

169
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,390
what we did is we wrote them a letter
and ask for formal legal opinion

170
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,460
saying that under certain exceptions to
the export rules

171
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,040
as long as we put some restrictions but
not perfect restrictions

172
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,030
some restrictions and they actually help
this craft those restrictions in a very

173
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,930
constructive way

174
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,960
some restrictions on that software
getting into

175
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,170
a list of seven countries including
North Korea Iran Iraq

176
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,729
and like I said it you need to read it
very carefully in terms of

177
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,840
white this organization can do and what

178
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,520
third parties can be with us offering
things like that

179
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,319
are but subject to those those

180
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,350
a

181
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,860
those details built into the

182
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,100
distribution method I'll we could use

183
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,990
servers in the United States of America
as a platform to broadcast

184
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,340
this strong encryption software all over
the world including India China

185
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,950
which i think is is a tremendous win and
a trend

186
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,300
tremendous victory for both the end
users and for the organization is trying

187
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,880
to promote

188
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,160
human rights through the arm

189
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,350
through making available to people
software that makes anonymous

190
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,410
communications possible

191
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,430
arm so

192
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,040
I guess though the moral of that story
is

193
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,230
again don't don't always assume that the
government is your enemy

194
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:53,740
if you talk to the right people and talk
to them in the right way

195
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,720
sometimes they will actively promote
your goals to

196
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,110
I you just have to be really careful
about the means used to do it

197
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,100
now the next topic that we should get
into and I'm gonna do this really

198
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,250
briefly I'm sure that will have a lot a
Q&A about this

199
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,770
I was there activist moe enhance source
software license the Hustler

200
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,510
I know that that's been sort of
controversial on

201
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,530
a Slashdot and

202
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,939
you know some people in free software
movement say

203
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,820
that it's not the GPL and well if that's
your criticism I guess you're right

204
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,950
I can see it's it's not the GPL

205
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,160
what it does contain is some
restrictions

206
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,209
on conduct I if you use the software
what you do is you agree that you're not

207
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,100
going to use it to violate people's
human rights you know I can use it to

208
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,230
cause

209
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,380
physical injury to people and and some
other

210
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,650
restrictions on conduct we don't think
you're entirely unreasonable

211
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,510
arm the Free Software Foundation takes

212
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,630
position put something up on their
website well you could never put conduct

213
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,500
restrictions in a

214
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,910
a software license that's unenforceable
and

215
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,290
their their position is that

216
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,280
%uh the law should be that you can't put
conduct restrictions

217
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:18,050
software licenses but the reality is a
lot of software companies do exactly

218
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,100
that

219
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,630
so so I I'm not sure

220
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,830
whether the the Free Software Foundation
actually gets to

221
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,160
be the judge determines that issue or
whether that issue is actually been

222
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,439
resolved

223
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,330
are additionally I think there are some
very significant advantages in the house

224
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,560
look

225
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,660
over the GPL because we have explicit
terms in there dealing with

226
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,140
in issue that's very important. the
human rights area which is

227
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,220
arm our government entities

228
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,779
actually subject to it the

229
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,490
the GPL to simply doesn't deal with the
issues a sovereign immunity

230
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:05,410
and for my list rations how many people
here know what the eleventh amendment is

231
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,839
you do it we have any hands at all does
anybody know what the eleventh amendment

232
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,640
is

233
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,699
are let me ask you this can you sue

234
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
the government have any state in federal
court

235
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,030
well

236
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,819
you can't you can in some cases if
they're violating civil rights that are

237
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,090
protected under the Fourteenth Amendment
to the US Constitution

238
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,720
but if the federal law on which your
case is based

239
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,120
is based on the Commerce Clause as
opposed to the 14th amendment the

240
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,280
Commerce Clause

241
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,280
being in the original Constitution
therefore proceed at the eleventh

242
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,880
amendment

243
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,270
14th amendment came after the Eleventh
Amendment so if

244
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,520
if it's a Commerce Clause regulation I

245
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,600
you can sue a state on that basis so now
they

246
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,910
they've thrown out certain kinds of
anti-discrimination laws

247
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,240
to the extent that they're based only on
the commerce clause into the 14th

248
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,780
amendment

249
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,100
the the reason that I asked the question
though

250
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,770
has to do with it 1999 case by the
Supreme Court

251
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:16,939
called the the things the College
Savings Bank

252
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,340
it was against the government of Florida
the trademark case

253
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,970
and they said that you can sue the
government of the state of Florida even

254
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,120
though Congress said we intend to make
state subject

255
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,940
the trademark laws in the United States
Supreme Court said

256
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,210
you can sue states for that unless

257
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:43,210
the state says it can be soon so

258
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,400
does that apply to copyrights we don't
know for sure yet

259
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,510
but let me ask you this if if the

260
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:54,520
the state of law order the state of New
York wanted to go ahead and start

261
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,760
handing out free copies of Microsoft
Windows and say hey you

262
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,819
do whatever you want with it you don't
have to pay microsoft thing could

263
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,040
Microsoft sue the state in New York in
the state of Florida for that

264
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,349
that's actually an open question right
now arm

265
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,330
and then when you get to the issue of
foreign sovereigns their

266
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,530
additional statutes to come into play
there is what's called

267
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,260
a commercial activity exception the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

268
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:29,260
I think that the licensing of software
even a free software falls within

269
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,790
that exception are

270
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,170
so when you're dealing with either a
foreign government

271
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:39,210
that decides for whatever reason that

272
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:43,220
it's not afraid of our threat to sue
them and actually uses that software and

273
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,140
uses it for an improper purpose

274
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,740
or and and I'll get into some other
reasons why later we plugged a

275
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,460
one-minute world

276
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:56,460
remaining but on when you when you do
with them

277
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,250
or you deal with the multinational
corporation which we have difficulty

278
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,330
suing right now

279
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,600
in US courts for human rights violations
because

280
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,890
even though they actin in cahoots with
you know the government of Myanmar

281
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,400
or you know it somebody's African
governments that gauge

282
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,490
terrible human rights violations
nevertheless

283
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:19,030
American oil companies seem to get off
the hook for the human rights violations

284
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,290
arm to

285
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,859
to the extent that this software license
can somehow

286
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,170
enter the mix it made provide

287
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm not going to say it up does are
deathly dozen but it will be tested in

288
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,000
court someday eventually

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,200
and it may provide an additional avenue
to get in

290
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,490
and to do at least something

291
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,800
to deter and compensate human rights
violations

292
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,010
arm I think my time is expired so

293
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,650
but let me sit down I'm sure we'll have
plenty of questions later and thank you

294
00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:00,650
very much

295
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,939
and %um buddhist at just fixing the
technology thing

296
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,230
elect to first thanks are

297
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,510
Michalik some activism on the conference
organizers

298
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:31,039
by inviting us from human rights
community

299
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,090
samina experiences and I would need Sen

300
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,158
also present over this list now

301
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,899
it's not that be and never been
collaborating with the technology

302
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:40,870
community

303
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,380
we have been committing and also

304
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,380
kind of an actively working with them to
increase the conservation and

305
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,500
but Chatham sadistic says building it Al
Ansar content

306
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,630
I some of us

307
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,279
have actually actively volunteered to to
the beta testing at the summer sup

308
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,630
developing and you continue to do that
but

309
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,820
as share on say that meet me in Myanmar
support & Mon Mar

310
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,899
can help from people been playing with
technology

311
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:16,210
now my talk is going to mainly focus on

312
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,850
placing the technologies developments
these people have tried and tramped

313
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,149
when the internet was just beginning to
develop and ban has it let us

314
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:29,750
up to lets a seven to ten years and you
can have seen now

315
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,799
Internet is becoming in 10 the
mainstream media

316
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,870
at least in the developed countries and
slowly

317
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,309
country like China also catching up and
become it very active user

318
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:46,049
the net up in the beginning the please
keep on Penn definitive beating the this

319
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,440
kind of quotations

320
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,090
which is at the center but it too in Mar
and

321
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,279
came on as slate least chains quotation

322
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,640
to say on it but he says that need to
eat sensitive is a damage and out around

323
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,200
eight

324
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,100
and in 2004 NBC that country like china
cuba our

325
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,529
many other countries me realize that the
reality on the ground has changed quite

326
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:09,390
differently

327
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,679
I did it turn out to be much different
than the party would be

328
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,480
but don't worry many of us stamped about
it

329
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,940
and I suppose it's not bad to dream that
at least try to

330
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,440
dream a good things and then see haven't
the ground really to folks up

331
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,620
and book from that and make sure that
the next time when we do things

332
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,289
you take into account my ground reality
are

333
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:35,179
we also thought that international
Internet as a donation in medium

334
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,529
between hasn't inherently empowering
power democrat Ising

335
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,529
and we talk after it interesting that
come

336
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:44,630
and likely get very well explain that

337
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,289
in fact in China now I'm some other
countries

338
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:52,230
but things have not really turn out to
be but be tardy would be

339
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,860
up also solved other presenters have

340
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,049
kind of in a Satanist mark context of
the US and many

341
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:03,950
other Western countries that there's no
privacy leaped

342
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,059
and let's get used to it which means
that the bottom more bad news upcoming

343
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,070
light at the home up the internet
development anonymity

344
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,740
could be broken the moment that software

345
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,840
which can locate the job of your job if
you're looking to sop to become a more

346
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,510
noms

347
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,980
and the court starts recognizing that
and start implementing

348
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,320
that also in their judgment and

349
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,389
man im on ma countries stripes seeing
that all

350
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:32,450
if China can be the Great Firewall why
not we can do it

351
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,510
and started beating I'll start lining
from the lessons of China

352
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,879
then the air he did beat it technology
not working in our favor of the baby

353
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,520
party woodworking a favor

354
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,820
and the FA speed technology is a big
brother

355
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,649
watching us everywhere not just here now

356
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:54,350
and but still even

357
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,010
up to on this development and
possibility of Technology been misused

358
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,340
they want the US government wanted to

359
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,870
kind of in a fund a project global
Internet freedom act

360
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:09,020
at as far as I know that never the
Bolivar

361
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:13,658
got passed through the I the communists
are senate but the idea was

362
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:17,139
to support at actively enters

363
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:21,299
anti-censorship are lets a censorship
circumvention software

364
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:25,230
and help the users in the country's like
China

365
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,549
cuba Korea and not Korea and others

366
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:32,260
to circumvent the consensus you which
means that even as long

367
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,100
as 2000 see people still think that

368
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,480
anti-censorship software are the need

369
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,350
for helping the user's and many of those
repressive countries

370
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,879
to get access to the information now
will come back to this issue later on

371
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:52,990
to Justin thumbs up seeing whether this
kind up as option makes

372
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,049
much sense today are we need to see

373
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:59,970
the technology between the mall social
context and dump some

374
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,389
what we have begin to accept and how the
censorship

375
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:07,450
s kinda phantom becoming more and more
remains tempting King

376
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,510
other then just beginning and ice on it
in fact

377
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:15,389
some bad happening and only know to
pursue countries

378
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:21,399
on in the beginning like bender

379
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,980
up the government responses they're kind
of in a

380
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,240
classified any meaning it to types of
responses which was my nose

381
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,039
more reactive response men ever this is
something to try to act

382
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,408
control it either through this was in
the beginning that the high excess cost

383
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:41,470
in a countries where the Internet
infrastructure a telecom infrastructure

384
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,000
was on my government

385
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,440
and they kept the internet prices so
high that not many people would be able

386
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,639
to access it

387
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:50,820
many countries ok i neva neva Khan those
barriers now

388
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,629
because the market mechanism has forced
them to eating

389
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:57,960
excess cost and it that has no more and
often been

390
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,659
effective for but at this same time the
filtering content

391
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:05,919
minted money doing it online behavior
are prohibiting internet use

392
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,080
entirely this was one of the pattern up

393
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,980
kinda thinking which begin maintained in
it begin spraying in the videos

394
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,010
countries

395
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,250
summer other countries which maybe even
a little smarter than that

396
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,440
that and set up restricting alone they
thought that Internet has a great

397
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,480
potential for economic development

398
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,529
and if you want to be in integrated to
the global economy and communication

399
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,899
let's let it come but will control it
and China

400
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:33,590
would be a fun and the just kind of a
shining example of that kind of pattern

401
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,289
that

402
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,000
that allowed it for the economic purpose
and internet usage

403
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,580
skyrocketed from almost nothing in 1996
to

404
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,059
sixty million users please

405
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:48,590
up in the beginning like there it

406
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,408
1996 I'm sure some of you have
participated in the Internet freedom

407
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,480
campaign which was down by the global
Internet Liberty

408
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,230
campaign bus the Blue Ribbon Campaign
again sent to send

409
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,250
ads internet censorship Ste and

410
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,480
that was the campaign which started in
the US so let's not forget that the

411
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,529
fast major censorship articulation game
in this country

412
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,820
before the other countries Rehman trying
to figure out what the heck this nate is

413
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,990
all about

414
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,539
he had started it on HIA and at that
time

415
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:23,539
the prime justification which began
surfacing and

416
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:27,240
fires a very solid argumentation was to
protect children

417
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,629
from on deserve information on whatever
other kinds of information they don't

418
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:33,899
want them to see

419
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:38,649
out and fight terrorism silence a racist
and hit Marlon

420
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:43,000
now let's go fast forward to 2004

421
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,960
the list as expanded and it has been a
martini worsen

422
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,899
it's not that this argument that any
longer use only in one country

423
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:54,629
not only in democratic country are
repressive country marlis everybody's

424
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:56,240
copping from each other

425
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,529
and international laws I've been kind of
synchronize

426
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:04,320
and down some thinking an income
supplement creating

427
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,928
common legal framework around internet
censorship but what do you call it

428
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:13,210
internet regulation

429
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,700
and this kinda access control

430
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,929
is as I said it's not necessarily

431
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:24,639
just limiting to the Internet in some
countries have been going beyond it

432
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:29,450
like China they want to even control all
digital form of communication

433
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,870
which includes min text messaging now

434
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,649
there's no guarantee that this will not
happen in any other country because

435
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,330
everybody uses

436
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,299
argument that national security com
fires about anything else

437
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,360
and national security becomes the issue
in many countries quite often

438
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,639
so that sin is expanding how it works
out but

439
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:51,679
other countries might follow a I this

440
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,859
then in a country wracked zimbabwe and
many other countries actually

441
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,100
amended to the money doing up email
communication so it's

442
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,840
many same internet censorship it is no
longer just a blocking a website's

443
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,250
and other thing but all former digital
communications are being surveilled

444
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,090
and being monitored being logged thing
put into a database

445
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,919
mining everything is happening around
there now then

446
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,270
that a detention laws are also becoming
Mon Mon

447
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,690
US allies in the sense initially begin
with one country then

448
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,580
they said okay let's have it up cross
Atlantic

449
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,639
the regulation around it across Atlantic

450
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:31,649
agreement on data retentions and those
laws

451
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:36,950
are soon likely to become kind of in a
more or less universally practice laws

452
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,059
can on

453
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,658
also it's no longer and the speed up
legislation alone

454
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:48,980
Sharon mention that China had on that he
had like 60 for people who are

455
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,129
very explicitly prosecuted convicted

456
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:56,159
and put behind bars on the charges which
had articulated with their use up

457
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,129
internet

458
00:27:57,129 --> 00:28:00,700
so internet censorship is no longer the
theoretical debate any longer

459
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,809
it's no longer legislating bad laws and
let's see what happens whether they went

460
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:05,790
back to see

461
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:10,129
but it is becoming a part of the
practice now

462
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:13,990
now in in a generalized pattern of
surveillance is a

463
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,250
increasing the privacy is kinda funny
being challenged all the time

464
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,460
the people are finding it harder and
harder to really use internet

465
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,020
in a BB taught in the beginning that be
would be able to use it

466
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,580
ISBN daily communications are becoming a
kind man potential

467
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,799
police state are taught by the book
potential on with the police

468
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,980
because they are asked to perform
certain tasks which in a traditionally

469
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,080
a supposed to be a law enforcement dusk

470
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,720
censorship is and some level in the
former either

471
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,780
through self-censorship of Fontana
public access point

472
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,740
are voluntary pledges is becoming a
private eye censorship

473
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,770
now all this is happening it's not
necessary that

474
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,320
people had to wait for two thousand von
on 9/11 event has to happen

475
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,700
this has been a gradual growth apollo
thinking

476
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,100
which is being kind of a name money
fight to accept that

477
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,260
be need on this thing to secure a set

478
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,039
and back thinking is kinda fun and
getting accepted

479
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:19,119
and legislative process are being can
even going without being challenged

480
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,840
and in on this one and the Cubs next

481
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,809
I and a globally now we have one more
argument to justify

482
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,710
all this in a bit let's say this section
on the the expression on the net

483
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,220
as well as even and other farm apps
practicing a civil liberties

484
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,830
is terrorism and terrorism in his is
used to justify depression and

485
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,730
restriction

486
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,369
on all types of the expression same the
garments

487
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:48,789
are kind of in a trying to get immunity

488
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:53,320
from their criticism on their practices
in the name of

489
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,879
kinda finance let's say protecting us
from again to terrorism

490
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,480
on protecting the national security

491
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,940
in that and mom n that the

492
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,599
impact on the global human rights is
going to be very serious

493
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,918
and we have already begin men the debate
down abugarade happen

494
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,030
in this country also people begin seeing
maybe

495
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:20,559
we don't need international laws maybe
started his ascension

496
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,129
any tax that happening which means that
be begin with Yvonne dream ten years ago

497
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:28,879
men beat our internet is that liberating
you can have any medium

498
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:33,020
and it will allow us a global community
freedom and alcanza benefits

499
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,780
and today in a change and mom n people
here also begin thinking

500
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,899
now it this could happen in the park to
play some internet

501
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:45,639
I'm not sure how much the global
community around the globe

502
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:48,750
can expect their own government which
has a very big

503
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,099
it's a history of democratic practices
are even civil liberties

504
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:56,460
can expect to protect the rights of the
user

505
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,480
now its in that sense we would said is
that

506
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,580
maybe in a future men beat think about
any medium

507
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,289
when we think about any technology which
can have an impact on society

508
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:12,340
at that time you might want to book and
placed those technological development

509
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,940
are

510
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,990
our own drawl within the larger context
up censorship freedom

511
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,049
and human rights and that situation

512
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,960
give a better chance to understand and
maybe mock have a modest

513
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,960
dream about but this technology can
really do thank you wins

514
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,740
how's everybody doing out there

515
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,909
okay I wanna thank the cotton dead cow

516
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:51,619
for having this panel I want to thank
oxblood in particular for inviting me

517
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:57,950
I wanna thank Grandmaster rat for
letting me crash on his couch last night

518
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,179
on basically I mean we talking about the
Citizen lab which is a lab at the

519
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:05,549
University of Toronto that was founded
by Professor Andy bird

520
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:09,980
as a professor of political science at
University China

521
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,840
I'm basically at the Citizen lab has
been great for me

522
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,099
let me take a lot of the project I was
working on my basement move them into

523
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:22,830
a university setting which is pretty
good in terms of bandwidth and quit me

524
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,158
know that confine stuff

525
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,659
basically my job is to goes to the
computer science department

526
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:33,730
find the best hackers and I can find and
also pillage hackers from the China 2600

527
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,159
representing right here

528
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:40,480
and basically putting together with
activists and

529
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,639
people in political science to work on

530
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:47,619
projects relating to Internet policy and
politics

531
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:51,020
and what we want to do and what we do do
is create

532
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,399
a space in a environment I'm where we

533
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,539
encourage people to get under the hood
look at what's going on and basically

534
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:02,070
provide a hard core technical background
to a lot of

535
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:05,480
the Human Rights Project said other
people are working on I'm you know we

536
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,450
want to get people that really
understand the technology and the policy

537
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,200
and put them together and see what they
come up with

538
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,090
I'm yeah

539
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,250
I'm basically yet know the next line

540
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,240
i won the projects that I'm heavily
involved it is called open at initiative

541
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,659
and actually it's grown I love a
basement operation into a club racin

542
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,580
between three universities

543
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,349
and we mash to secure funding from the
Open Society Institute

544
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:35,918
and basically we're looking at internet
filtering and surveillance practices

545
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,639
worldwide

546
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:41,010
from a technical and policy point of
view as well as

547
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,260
looking at the circumvention technology
that others are developing

548
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,789
and developing our own

549
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:52,129
I'm were interested in a lot of
questions relating to Internet filtering

550
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:54,359
not just whites blocked and how

551
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,399
but who's making the decisions and how
are those decisions made

552
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,570
I'm what involvement does the public
have in those decisions in which they

553
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,559
know about it

554
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,700
and some other pride amid talk a little
bit more in detail but some other

555
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,320
projects I'm working on

556
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,149
I'm one of them is to put together a
sort of Friendster slash

557
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:14,190
or cut have internet filtering in these
countries

558
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,399
so you know who are the heads up the
ISP's who are the people in government

559
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,040
to make the decisions regarding the
internet regarding internet filtering

560
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,649
and how do a social network map and see
a lot of countries

561
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:28,629
these people are related to each other
are they have some kind of connection

562
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:29,848
with one another

563
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:34,339
we want to map kinda how the decisions
are being made at a policy level

564
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:39,779
as well as we want to map our this is
being implemented on a technical level

565
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm to do this week we and established a
a human based network

566
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,739
I'm we call h2h activist activist's
relationships with groups that are

567
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,369
working on these issues

568
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:53,770
in the country's and this is extremely
important

569
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:58,040
we also have a technological network I'm
so that we can do the testing

570
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,470
have internet filtering worldwide I'm
ice why talk about the human based

571
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,400
network because that gets overlooked
ally times because

572
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,990
you can find things technologically but
it's the contacts that's really

573
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,180
important

574
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,330
I'm when you're dealing with internet
censorship I'm

575
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,140
you know a lot of countries block porn
and other kinds of things

576
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,140
yeah if you look at my logs from the
testing box University Toronto

577
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,339
they've emailed me a few times because
visiting hundreds of thousands of porn

578
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:30,890
sites kinda sets of some red flags at
the University

579
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,940
by to basically these people provide the
context

580
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,580
and the technological research that we
develop also enables them

581
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,819
to challenge these practices in their
countries

582
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:45,029
on their own terms I'm basically what we
do

583
00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:48,930
from a technological point of view is a
we get access

584
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:52,009
in these countries in a variety of ways
depending on the security situation

585
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:53,490
those countries

586
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,190
and how much risk the individuals in
those countries are willing to take

587
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,160
and because they are putting themselves
at risk for us its research but for them

588
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,910
it's a serious concern I'm what we do is

589
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,500
we develop less URL's and domains

590
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,569
I'm summer which we call a globalist
which is kinda for

591
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,520
just a broad category your else that we
tested a general sense of what's going

592
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,310
on

593
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:19,630
as well as putting together a list of
high-impact web sites in these are web

594
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,410
sites

595
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,879
that are of particular concern in the
country that we're testing

596
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,200
all we do is we we run through these a
number of times

597
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,330
first time is just basically a GET
request

598
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:36,150
you know can we get it can we not really
record the Hatters

599
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,700
and I send that information back to lab
for analysis

600
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,460
anything that doesn't kinda matchup
sweet assed one connection from our

601
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,750
testing location in your suit rano

602
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,770
and other connection from remote
computer at the headers don't match are

603
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,370
some things we are going on me flag that
is kind of being awed

604
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:56,520
and kisses a lot of different behaviors
in terms of filtering

605
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,299
I'm depending on the type of filtering
that's going on

606
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:03,150
if they're filtering with the commercial
application or something that gives you

607
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,190
a block Paige

608
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,520
that's actually good for us because it
tells you can't go here because we've

609
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,529
blocked it

610
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:12,520
in other situations he just get
different headers I'm we mite will go to

611
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,089
a height

612
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:16,380
200 name I get a for three or four for
whatever

613
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,700
and in other cases you'll get anything
at all the connection just dies when you

614
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,420
try to go to a band site you don't get

615
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,600
shatters back you don't get anything and
that somehow we classify

616
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,790
the URL's that we test and the second
run

617
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,440
after we've determinate something weird
is going on then we chest with

618
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,720
TCP trace route see how far up the chain
we can go

619
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,120
before it dies I'm

620
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,120
yeah just a little bit about filtering
blacklist means

621
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,520
you know there's a a less to view or
else categorize your house usually

622
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,910
am that are used to block whitelist
means

623
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,759
the only allow access to a certain
number of your house missus

624
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:56,029
been called the National internet model
which is sad

625
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:59,440
being developed in Myanmar formerly
Burma and cuba

626
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,520
which is basically they have an internal
network for the citizens

627
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,600
with pre-approved sites they can visit
I'm content analysis is

628
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,759
you know just mainly refers to I am

629
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:13,759
blocking by keyword: our the general
network setup

630
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:17,370
so I'm gonna get into more specifically
as opposed to China lie the countries

631
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,100
that where

632
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,549
particular focusing on right now are in
Central Asia and the Middle East

633
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:26,080
and basically we're seeing a kinda same
set up developing as opposed to China

634
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,770
which is

635
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,029
basically router base blocking these
countries are purchasing

636
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:35,310
technology I'm from Western countries in
using the in conjunction with cache

637
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,100
servers

638
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:42,150
to actually have a really fission
filtering system

639
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:45,580
yeah basically this is the behaviour
block pages I'm

640
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,690
one of the things we do is try to figure
out exactly what technologies are using

641
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,040
sometimes it's easy

642
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,330
like when they have Smart Filter in the
block Paige and usually

643
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,609
star filter shows up in the headers as
well but other times

644
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:59,859
you know they don't tell you exactly
what's going on

645
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:03,710
in headers and you just usually get a
result back from net cash which is

646
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:07,470
you know just your basic cashing service
other times you get justice generic

647
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,660
air you don't really know what's going
on basically

648
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,600
there's different levels have
accountability in some cases go to have

649
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,640
a blog page because then you know for
sure that it's being blocked by policy

650
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,089
I'm in his Pakistan they're actually a
pretty interesting instead of giving

651
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:24,130
your blog page

652
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,290
are a timeout actually redirect you to
another site

653
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:30,839
I'm so here we have beer like which is
an opposition party and stop dictator

654
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:32,880
karma after my office the president

655
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,960
and he's reader active weird MSN Search

656
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,970
and some weird Russian site and there's
been reports from users there that what

657
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,520
I'll actually do sometimes

658
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,410
is make a fake website the opposition
party and then when you sign up for

659
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,850
their email list and other things well

660
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:51,730
they are having so that's kinda sneaky

661
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,259
and talk a little bit specifically about
Saudi Arabia and there's been a lot of

662
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,700
work done on filtering there in

663
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,279
and I've been working on it myself I'm
and it's a good kinda profile to

664
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:02,529
counterbalance what's going on in China

665
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:05,690
I'm basically they have a very sensual I
system they have a

666
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,310
a big pharma cache servers and proxy
servers located at the IRS you

667
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,160
which is way up on the chain so all is
the ISP's and universities and

668
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,470
everything else that sandanista

669
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:18,910
are all subjected to blocking at this
one centralized point

670
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,180
I'm so it's pretty easy to test and get
a good sense of what's going on there

671
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,410
on their block Paige filtering which is

672
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,970
page comes up tells you hey you can't go
here because we've blocked it

673
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,630
and they have an blocking request form
unblock

674
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,410
request form I feel that the unblock
request for a few times

675
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,830
nothing happened one other things that
we're working on it will call it a

676
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,910
fingerprint but it's not really a
fingerprint

677
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,920
is basically we want to figure out what
come when commercial technology is being

678
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,980
used

679
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,900
in these countries to filter on a
national level we want to figure out

680
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,830
what it is

681
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:56,609
and one other ways that we've come up
with is II

682
00:40:56,609 --> 00:41:02,470
cue next slide is to look for
miscategorized URL's here's an example

683
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:05,609
teen pregnancy die or work is classified

684
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,670
in Smart Filters health and some other
categories which is generally okay which

685
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,799
means you can get to if those categories
are being blocked

686
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:16,500
by the way Smart Filter and Websense
have a filtering category called NGO

687
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,100
slash

688
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,650
advocacy group which is basically hum

689
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,130
you know a handy category for regimes
that might wanna feel to these groups

690
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,230
they just check it off on the boxing

691
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,600
go about their business I'm by you
notice that teen pregnancy .org slash

692
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,119
team is misclassified as pornography

693
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,930
there's nothing pornographic there it's
in the air probably because

694
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:41,149
I'm have teen and dot the domain and
teen the pass kinda sets of

695
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,779
their automated process the claim to
manually look at all the rows in the

696
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:46,529
database but they don't

697
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:50,180
I'm so basically you why do as I put
together listen these misclassified

698
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,830
URL's and I run them

699
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,960
and for different commercial products
and if I'm getting a good hi

700
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,299
hit rayon blocks for sites shouldn't be
blocked

701
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:03,960
it tipped me off pretty well as to what
commercial filtering system using

702
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,500
and actually in saudi arabia if you look
if you look in the in the content other

703
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,470
up the block Paige you'll see the insert
the special tag

704
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:16,720
and when it's a Smart Filter block they
have felt recalls SF

705
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,940
and when it's a block that they've added
themselves like a rough times which is

706
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,670
not in the Smart Filter database

707
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,420
it says local so it's easy to tell white
ones they've added and what ones are

708
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,650
blocked default by Smart Filter

709
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,130
I recently Reporters Without Borders put
out and advisory about some gay web

710
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,210
sites that were being blocked in saudi
arabia

711
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,210
and they were blocked because I checked
but the thing is they were blocked

712
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,350
because the saudis want to block them

713
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,509
they were blocked because they're
miscategorized by Smart Filter

714
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:46,430
so a lot of these countries they're
using this commercial

715
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,919
applications to do their filtering I
mean release a problem having

716
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,520
proprietary less that people can check

717
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,580
and so people are are subjecting entire
nations to filtering based on the

718
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,660
decisions

719
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,210
made by accompany on information that
they won't

720
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,350
let us scrutinize

721
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,790
and there's also other unintended
consequences this happen in India

722
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,660
there if they try to block one Yahoo
group and they sent out in order to all

723
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,069
the ISP's to block it

724
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:17,480
sows Indian South Indian the most and
didn't have the capacity to filter

725
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,720
actually just block the IP address and
groups yahoo dot com

726
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,250
so all is a Yahoo group were blocked
until they finally figured out

727
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:27,920
how to block just the one last summer
the ISP's anyways

728
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,750
I'm you're saying is recently can do you
need ot work

729
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,080
I receive the same treatment but there's
a bunch of other sites hosted on that

730
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,640
server they're also block

731
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,770
and in terms of countries are filtering
is done within a certain legal

732
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,630
environment

733
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,160
this is good ammunition for people that
are fighting because there's no order to

734
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,319
block those sites

735
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:49,500
yet they're blocked and so they can take
that to court challenge the government's

736
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,989
in an open way

737
00:43:52,989 --> 00:43:56,560
moving onto circumvention technology why
the things we're working on its cult

738
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,489
sci-fi &

739
00:43:57,489 --> 00:44:01,049
I'm it started kind of off as a side
project I haven't had a lot of time to

740
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:01,869
work on it

741
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:05,310
but basically it's nothing new and it's
really simple

742
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,420
all I wanted to do was make really
simple

743
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,259
application that peaked at non-technical
people could use

744
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:15,670
that was really similar to existing
products that were out there

745
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:20,270
except for was just easy view says its
main priority

746
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,520
and taking into account some loves
vulnerabilities that people had talked

747
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,330
about it those existing products

748
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:30,500
the main 1i pillage with CGI proxy which
is really awesome lot of people use it

749
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,509
but for non-technical people setting up
Apache Mon SSL

750
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:37,700
just they won't do it any steamy

751
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,339
really easy for them so we actually code
in Python basically it's an SSL web

752
00:44:42,339 --> 00:44:43,339
server

753
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:46,900
am and provides the user with a webform

754
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:51,009
they put in the URL they wanna go to if
rewrites the

755
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:55,089
the your else to point back through the
proxy delivers it to the user

756
00:44:55,089 --> 00:45:00,100
its his party exceed for Windows to make
it nice and they just double click on it

757
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,359
starts out

758
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,310
and its and we try to keep the options
pretty limited we have bandwidth

759
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:07,950
throttling sites you know what your

760
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,569
use up all your band with letting people
surf through your connection

761
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:15,400
and you can use a management but the
main thing we want to do is sort of

762
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,520
replace the idea

763
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,580
uva technological peer to peer network
with human peer to peer network

764
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,359
the problem with peer to peer networks
answer conventions that

765
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,410
if you use a system that relies arm

766
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,920
I know it snowing other nodes if taken
note harvest

767
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,710
so connect each make a new account and
connecting to the network

768
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:37,779
get and I P each time they just are
adding

769
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,950
to the blocking list the same is true
for for distributing

770
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,290
no URL's to publicly to public

771
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:48,980
proxies and things like that is that if
the people you're targeting with the

772
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,470
information can find out about it so can
the people

773
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:55,029
intercepting looking at the information
MindTree these groups

774
00:45:55,029 --> 00:45:59,339
and so we want to do is was make the
requirement basically that

775
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:03,569
you have to know somebody outside the
country to run this thing for you

776
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:07,049
it's not a service we are it's on a
public service that you would let people

777
00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:08,940
it's just for people that you know

778
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,970
and we Saif we keep it really simple and
kinda low-tech like that

779
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,839
it has a better chance of survival and
along with the people that are working

780
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,739
on

781
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:20,160
public proxy systems and all that kind
of thing which thought it was a good

782
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,129
addition

783
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,330
the other problem with volunteer base
systems are public proxy systems

784
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:30,299
I mean this is the case with CGI proxy
for sure is a few have

785
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:35,440
somebody running CGI proxy telling users
hey you know use this

786
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,589
they can intercept everything that
you're doing to cell

787
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:43,250
the other problem with it is that
self-signed certificates

788
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,339
and Tuscan easily be subjected to man

789
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:49,589
middle attacks in people are pretty
concerned about that the other thing we

790
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:50,489
want to do is

791
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:54,460
is starter resource for basically would
collect projects and other people

792
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,560
working on

793
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,970
and look at a certain scenarios where
they would be affective

794
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:02,029
so that if there are groups or
individuals that want to implement these

795
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:02,980
products

796
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,200
they can't look at it and say yeah you
know my scenario fits

797
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,390
this situation this product is what's
the best for me

798
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,400
I'm an awesome you know look at if there
was any particular problems are glaring

799
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,480
errors in the design of the system kinda
point those out

800
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,380
are so we did that with them I V V

801
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,509
which also runs Voice of America the
contracting with anonymizer to provide

802
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:30,460
web-based circumvention systems to
people in Iran

803
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,410
and it works but the problem is that the
system designed

804
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,319
to get around filtering filters because

805
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,770
if a view run public proxies are CGI
proxy

806
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:46,160
most people are looking at porn and sell
they set up the system

807
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,250
to block access to porn except for it
was done in in a really horrible way

808
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:54,170
basically was done by blocking keywords
and domains soft a domain

809
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:58,619
name not the past just a domain contain
any of the keywords you can go there

810
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:01,700
so you can go to George W Bush dot com

811
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,049
Scott pushing it and you can go to a lot
of US

812
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,359
embassy sites can has ass in it

813
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,410
you couldn't go to any site that was .tv

814
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:16,049
has TV in it whole domain name in the
same with 'My from Malaysia

815
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:19,779
I mean it was a completely ridiculous
system we found it thank 82

816
00:48:19,779 --> 00:48:23,160
have these words we tested on

817
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,600
and we test them from connections in
Iran to try to find sites that were

818
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,630
double blocked

819
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:31,140
sites that were blocked by the iranians
and sites that were blocked

820
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,259
by then by the system that there is
there supposed to use to get to the

821
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:35,060
site's

822
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:39,000
we're fine many but we found a few am

823
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,600
the other thing is that when you when
you when you go to these

824
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,819
anonymizer sites and translate the Farsi
it tells them that

825
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:50,210
that there not only is protected that
they're not at risk from hack

826
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:57,210
hackers are governments that might want
to spy on them but it's on plane taxed

827
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,690
so they're giving people this false
sense of security

828
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:04,000
when their communications can easily be
intercepted

829
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,960
yeah they can circumvent properly and
yeah the URL if they want to go to his

830
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,509
office kid

831
00:49:09,509 --> 00:49:13,489
by the content can easily be snapped

832
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:17,350
am so basically anonymizer has

833
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:20,589
an SSL option after premium users

834
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:24,520
yes that's not good enough for the
Iranian people

835
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,720
so the main thing i kind want to end
with which which is

836
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,100
oxford's idea activist activist networks
and that

837
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,529
really takes developing relations trust
with real people

838
00:49:35,529 --> 00:49:39,440
and not just relying on technological
solutions to these problems

839
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,210
I'm you know user users are being
encouraged by people are times these

840
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:48,299
sir third-party brokers that a tour
around and visit with different she owes

841
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:53,470
recommend software to them so you know
there needs to be

842
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:56,940
a pretty good audit what's available out
there say group can make informed

843
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,190
decisions

844
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:02,190
for you know for security needs that fit
their specific purposes because in

845
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:06,069
in this different climates in terms of
security in different countries so

846
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:09,650
so some solutions that might not be
completely fully secure

847
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,509
I am might work in a situation where the
consequences

848
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:17,180
you know aren't too bad I mean that's
that's something that bad

849
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,299
we have to do working really closely
with these groups

850
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:23,609
especially in terms of development it's
not enough to just

851
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:27,650
developed some new cool technology or
whatever the latest thing is

852
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:32,700
because in La the cases I visited NGOs
for the last 15 users sharing one 56k

853
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,940
dialup

854
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,700
I mean they just cant than with
restrictions are huge in in like

855
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,009
developing countries

856
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:42,869
and also really ancient operating system
similar and pretty much

857
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:46,989
everybody's running Windows people are
slowly migrating to mix by

858
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:50,009
I am you know Windows is certainly

859
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:54,489
what everybody runs I guessing

860
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:58,220
have a couple of search suggestions that
that people have told me in terms

861
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,529
types of technology would like to see I
am

862
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:05,220
to be implemented I'm in addition to
knowledge transfer and training things

863
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,950
like that

864
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:10,880
is one requirements that projects serve
have a firm commitment to support

865
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,810
because group lot of people will go over
there install stuff teach them how to

866
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:15,900
use it but then

867
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,549
there's no support overtime yet the
other thing is things like

868
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:22,700
remote backup systems that are really
easy to run because

869
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,819
I'm now that group are becoming part GG
own as part of that they have to crack

870
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,049
down on piracy

871
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:31,390
the use that as an excuse to go in sees

872
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:35,970
computers and NGOs because most people
are using legitimate versions of Windows

873
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:39,390
Mike as they see is that is Nick as an
excuse to

874
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:43,799
to seize their boxes and so at the very
least d like to have their data stored

875
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:46,540
somewhere else so they can at least
recover from

876
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,799
I'm and a lot of really simple ideas
like that the main points to put a

877
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:52,369
really user friendly

878
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:57,020
you know interface on them so that
people don't have to be to inconvenience

879
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:01,970
because if it's too much inconvenience
to you security lifetimes the just

880
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:06,200
so that's my service saying that like to
get across to everybody is that

881
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,489
it's more than just development we
actually have to start developing human

882
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:10,970
relationships with people

883
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:17,970
thanks

884
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,190
like to thank two groups of people

885
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:27,470
our panelists and special you guys this
is

886
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:31,240
long presentation all very hearty thanks
for sticking around I just wanna check

887
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:31,680
how much

888
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,150
we have about five minutes okay

889
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,220
we have a shorter tonight and we would
like but

890
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:47,220
I'm sure some people have questions
microphone is up here

891
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:57,140
hi out one figure that stuck with me
during particular your presentation was

892
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,710
the 200,000 people

893
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:02,910
forced into labor without any kind trial
anything like that

894
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:07,270
is that indicative love Leighton
revolution bubbling up to the surface

895
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,480
words that word you

896
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,490
get the feeling abused by local
officials somebody

897
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:18,490
talked of the local magistrate got
themselves tossed this %uh

898
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:25,810
dear there are there rain two different
reasons why people put into

899
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:29,070
reeducation through labor the

900
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,310
could be dissidents because say need to
be reeducated

901
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:36,120
on they could be people with this of
locals all of the above out one is that

902
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,690
a problem

903
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,900
with are trying to investigate that is

904
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,030
it's very hard to get information and
that underscores why it's very hard for

905
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,790
us to do the work

906
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,440
but what we also see is that there is a
percentage are those

907
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,440
to treat it particularly harshly and
that's cool

908
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,170
political related crime so if you're
union organizing an independent democrat

909
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,030
party

910
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:59,170
you know those people are going to treat
much more harshly and then I think

911
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:01,510
recently that not only in the RTL camps

912
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:05,370
they've also been put into psychiatric
hospitals and calm

913
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:09,100
with a really sucky to really you know
really torture very bad things

914
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,920
because it's something wrong they think
with them and they're trying to decide

915
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,740
wash them

916
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,240
I had a question about the the Great
Firewall of China

917
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,750
there the crew attempts to bypass that

918
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,839
do you think there's a certain amount of
like obviously the the more that its

919
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:30,250
attempt to bypass another

920
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:33,900
if it actually works then the Chinese
all updated so that

921
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,940
stops working as humanly and is there a
certain amount of time that you think

922
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,339
that

923
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:43,270
it would have to be essentially useless
for them to just take it down or with

924
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,480
their just have to be massive

925
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,780
Hill political change in the country
before that would be taken down

926
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,250
I'm gonna as bill shot away in on this
but I think I from our perspective from

927
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:52,520
the

928
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,460
the actor this perspective I think it's
been a shift and the shift has been weak

929
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,720
although using and we're still using the
word

930
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,550
the Great Firewall I think the shift in
strategy within China

931
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:06,160
is from blocking the strategy to
filtration

932
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,078
monitoring and surveillance and that's
you can see that trend in the new

933
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,640
S&M the software that's now filtering

934
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,640
s you know and SMS messages like 100
million a year

935
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,680
and they actually can store the sender
and everything

936
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,369
so I think the shift has been to not
just stop

937
00:55:23,369 --> 00:55:26,470
but to actually let people know I'll

938
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,510
that it's being monitored for content
and I think that has a real ripple

939
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:31,030
effect

940
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:34,910
so i think thats even more effective to
not just stop by to let people know what

941
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:36,420
you send in what you received

942
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,980
is being monitored which is much more
affected

943
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:45,430
just just

944
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:48,599
up fascinating and i really appreciate
I'm

945
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,329
all the speakers ice had a question are
moron

946
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:55,900
let's say spam which I think a lot of
people do want to

947
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:01,000
eliminate from their lives but from what
I'm hearing here to do that is going to

948
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,569
have a significant impact because you
happy women AP

949
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:08,740
and on them in the book that the EU
unanimity

950
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,420
I'll up the sender and thats to
eliminate the spam as many I guess I

951
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,059
just like

952
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:17,670
some these thoughts on how do we
accomplish both goals

953
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,020
to to to eliminate the spam but still
try to keep things open

954
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:29,020
for things like the human rights

955
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:39,950
I mean some other testing was been doing
with email accounts in China basically

956
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:46,180
spam filters sounds the email providers
there are configured to block political

957
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,180
messages

958
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:51,380
so spam filtering technologies news for
that purpose

959
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,220
I'm but in terms of just Larkins

960
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,369
general most since

961
00:56:58,369 --> 00:57:03,230
Spam Assassin see

962
00:57:03,230 --> 00:57:06,690
tax things ash national

963
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:13,690
I would like to decide

964
00:57:14,339 --> 00:57:20,319
this

965
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,038
dealing with this kinda the shoes maybe
like

966
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:28,089
when it comes to censorship why do we
always go to the level of knitted

967
00:57:28,089 --> 00:57:31,259
block it and yet willing to give up
their rights

968
00:57:31,259 --> 00:57:35,039
because there is some and I it's coming
from the marketers by not be used the

969
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:35,949
same mechanism

970
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:39,369
teachers encourage because as pam is a
very strong connection

971
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:43,759
the way the marketing concept devil so
instead of dealing with that

972
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:47,329
to enable a plate the first thing we do
is second by summer civil liberty

973
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:48,359
because we got annoyed

974
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:51,828
insert going to it and solution

975
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:55,179
it's like market-based solution is being
promoted all true

976
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:58,289
in terms of getting are targeting
marketing and uppity

977
00:57:58,289 --> 00:58:01,939
sepia played that principle to deal with
the spam

978
00:58:01,939 --> 00:58:05,699
that it it is being this good it's
almost the consumer stop buying on

979
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:10,509
anything which is come by spam and the
VB have encouraging allowed the dynamic

980
00:58:10,509 --> 00:58:12,559
marketing to continue to go unchallenged

981
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,829
it has got extended into electronic form

982
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:19,969
dumps for spam I think that may be a
better it would start thinking about

983
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:23,179
each other then just let anonymity go
because

984
00:58:23,179 --> 00:58:30,179
you want to be spam thanks very much

985
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,480
I'm sure a few people might have some
more questions

986
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,869
these guys maybe few minutes

987
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:42,940
outside wherever in thanks very much for
coming

988
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:49,940

989
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,950
