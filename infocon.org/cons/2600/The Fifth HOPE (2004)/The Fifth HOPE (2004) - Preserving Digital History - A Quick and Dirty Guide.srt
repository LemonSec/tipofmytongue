00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,640
right now we have Jason Scott with
preserving digital history a quick and

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,380
dirty guide

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:33,379
and I'll let it and take it away

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,370
I appreciate that although I haven't
done anything yet hi everybody

10
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,790
my name is Jason Scott I run a cycle
text files dot com

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,960
I run a number of other sites related to
it PDF to text files to com web to text

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,540
file dot com all related

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,039
different portions of digital media and

14
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,430
go digitized analog stuff basically

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:02,170
I the chose to give this speech just
because

16
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,579
over the course of the last six years I
picked up a few things and got some

17
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:08,249
ideas now keep in mind that I'm coming
up from

18
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,770
a different area than most academics to
you

19
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,719
because most academics go to school and
then learn something and then tell

20
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,069
people who didn't go to school

21
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,179
out to do it and this is the other way
around

22
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:23,639
%uh school didn't really work for me so

23
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:28,479
arm I want to look at the it's been laid
down some foundations of what I'm

24
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,298
talking about

25
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,039
one of the biggest problems like the
ones giving a speech is that

26
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,340
arm you fall into what's called a geek

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,119
really de Lille you've ever seen
somebody who's talking about a subject

28
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:41,049
that's a lot

29
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,389
a lot of meat on it and you suddenly see
them stop talking

30
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:49,289
they look at you it's because their
brain is doing pattern recognition and

31
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,299
they realize that

32
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,159
in fact they could probably tell you a
lot more than they're telling you

33
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,719
now trying to filter it real time
doesn't work

34
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,909
so what I'm telling you is probably for
some love you

35
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,950
very old information very obvious
information for other people it might

36
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,709
not be

37
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,709
are I don't know where you're coming in
from

38
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,170
a caring about digital history some you
might be waiting for the next panel

39
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,209
arm I don't use PowerPoint I don't like
it

40
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,930
I don't read from a screen to tell you
what's going on

41
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,670
it's just it's a personal a some people
do it I don't like this

42
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,709
have portions of the speech where I say
to you I am now going to tell you what

43
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,489
you should bring back from this speech

44
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:33,709
I don't really mind what you're gonna do
with my speech

45
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,140
I record my own speeches and do with
them as I wish so

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,400
you know you with my speeches you wish
arm

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,900
intrinsically I put a lot of value

48
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,540
on digital media digitize asians and
things like that

49
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,969
some people don't they simply don't

50
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:54,810
arguing with them is a waste of time I'm
not in that business

51
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,840
if a person says to me that fundamental

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,140
half smile question the getting my
timing think so

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,799
why should anyone even care we're not
even

54
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,109
you know we really shouldn't even be in
the same room with school

55
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:12,749
you know let's go our separate ways
because I'm not going to be able to

56
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:13,390
convince you

57
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,939
I see inherent value in taking
historical

58
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,219
events that happened online

59
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:25,340
in my case and putting them online for
others to Paul

60
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,209
I see the web is a miracle it may be
inevitable miracle but still a miracle

61
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:30,950
nonetheless

62
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:36,030
I see where we've gone with it isn't
inherent miracle while teasing out a

63
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,109
plea game saying

64
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:41,420
talking about you know do you get ho and
what people have done with

65
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,829
a life journals and stuff I think all
that is absolutely brilliant

66
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,040
thing by I just love this arm soul

67
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,048
getting perspective you know

68
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,499
at some point we're very sure that

69
00:03:56,499 --> 00:04:01,609
the Sun is going to blow up we're not
completely sure

70
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,079
we think that it was created at a
certain point and

71
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,340
either by the hand of God or I'll very
large amount of parrots

72
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,999
or some other method we weren't there
were not sure

73
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,159
records are sketchy but we do know that
its

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,259
burning right now like that eventually
it's not

75
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,650
and it's not really so it's gonna
explode as probably go well

76
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,299
in goal the first few planets and then
go back in again

77
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,169
at that point people were not going to
be thinking about digital history

78
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,930
I they're probably going to be leaving
very quickly

79
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,509
the human race is an endless endless
repeating story

80
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,860
love while there's something in the road
while we're barreling towards it

81
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,669
oh my god it's coming this way we really
ought to do something about it

82
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:52,909
and at the last second week spend every
bit as energy we have just

83
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,389
engineer things just around to avoid it
go that way

84
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,490
when we could have just kinda drop
things and gotten

85
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,020
by that's what we do people like myself

86
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,409
took in interest in events in our own
lives

87
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,410
I in this case for me dialer bulletin
board systems

88
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,580
and as a child I remember getting all
these wonderful

89
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,109
file sent to me and Heather everything
else in downloading them

90
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,410
and when I reached a into my you know

91
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,669
mid-twenties I went looking for
information and could not find it

92
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:28,810
and realize that in my house and
deteriorating

93
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,360
floppy disks were a bunch of files that
I had about

94
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,699
8000 9000 arm and

95
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,979
so I basically started putting them
online

96
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,508
and I a got a lot of attention because
it turned out

97
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,210
thousands of people had the same
yearning that I did it just happen be

98
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,878
that I had the desks

99
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,970
which I have to point out is arm the
most important

100
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,139
aspect digital or or historical
collection

101
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,310
is to be at the event when it happens
it's also the hardest

102
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,830
it is very difficult in doing research
on Lincoln's assassination

103
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,530
to be there but it is the most important
part

104
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,680
up the whole aspect or you never get the
information

105
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,789
arm to my great surprise in terms of

106
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:18,490
how we collect things arm lincoln's
blood-stained

107
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,620
program is in a bag in the Smithsonian
Institution

108
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,210
if you wish to go see it 'em because
somebody thought that was kinda

109
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,360
important

110
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,569
and weekend we would never be able to do
anything about that

111
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,289
arm it in preserving

112
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:40,300
this a snorkels

113
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,210
data arm I started out

114
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,190
pulling up these I'll text files arm but
my mission has expanded over time

115
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,650
because I realized how easy it was

116
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,889
to be at a location or be somewhere and
pull it down once

117
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,879
it has become in morning the easy
whereas once a for instance you had to

118
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,949
get every issue of life magazine by
buying it

119
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:06,319
it's very simple now to pull website
down with a double you get

120
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,050
or a/w get dash dash user agent string

121
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,280
because they won't let W get attack it

122
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,180
a because people don't want their stuff

123
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,970
saved I guess arm and put it away

124
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,479
I have a lot of dot part a cheesy files
in a lot of locations for things that

125
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,560
may or may not have any meaning in
another

126
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,009
for 5-10 twenty years arm

127
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:33,740
you know like I said eventually the Sun
blows up but sometime before that we

128
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,419
still care about this

129
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,609
and if we play the game like was gonna
care about this in 20

130
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,129
15 sixty years we can really work
ourselves into a hole anyway

131
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,490
if you do that with anything you know
mean why do I have this lunch when I'm

132
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,870
not going to be

133
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,300
families to be hungry tomorrow you can
play that game live in the future live

134
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,710
in a way that doesn't exist

135
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,159
and you know convince yourself that

136
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,188
inaction is the best action that's fine

137
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,379
I mean you know TV is good and arm

138
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:07,139
I like going out not working computers
but that's just part of the

139
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,759
for the game arm is

140
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,969
in terms of archaeology that has to come
out from work that I've done

141
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,139
arm I I'm doing a documentary and I'll
abort abort systems

142
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,289
I've spent about three years on it I'm
at two hundred interviews

143
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,240
traveled many thousands of miles one of
the things that really struck me was

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,090
how fragile some information was in some
wasn't

145
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,140
for instance on people remembered
stories very well but didn't really have

146
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,620
any reporting a bit

147
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,760
arm to my great surprise I conducted

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,270
word Christian Sims only video interview

149
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,579
on this was a man greeted X modem he
call creates the first PBS

150
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:53,740
he may have created several other things
for the first time

151
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,210
but they're was no visual recording word
christiansen

152
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,560
looked like when he was talking there
were a few

153
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,710
deal recordings of his voice arm

154
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,530
I made this recording for my documentary
I intend to digitize it and put it up

155
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,100
in various locations including archive
organ other ones

156
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,239
he doesn't always talk about Bolton
court system back some time to talk

157
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,439
about what coffee

158
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:20,799
but just having that information

159
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,220
available means that I'm not the
filtering

160
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,559
cross and that's something that's very
hard to understand that it's not always

161
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,299
the information itself

162
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:36,129
because information is itself a
political event arm

163
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:40,669
sometimes arm you have when you're
reading something

164
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:44,149
if you're reading a historical
perspective

165
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:47,850
your actually beating 3 different levels

166
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,619
time you're reading about the time that
is being written about

167
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:55,699
you are reading about on your you were
in the time

168
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:00,109
the person who wrote it wrote the
description and you are in your own time

169
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:04,829
the person reading you can pull from all
three levels at the same time

170
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:08,429
decide that this person with with income
people about this

171
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,608
this is why there are so few pictures
Franklin Delano Roosevelt wheelchair

172
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:16,160
an event that certainly occurred is
because

173
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,009
it was a agreed-upon situation not to
portray the president United States

174
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:26,029
in a wheelchair now that has value

175
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:29,470
not only does it have value but has
value because it tells about the time of

176
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,549
the people who were talking about
roosevelt and what they thought was

177
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:32,980
right

178
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,419
and it tells about now about what your
opinions would be

179
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,559
about the fact that people were doing
this back even

180
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,179
then arm wanna policed arm shocking

181
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:47,869
Albert shocking risk involved in it is
held there really isn't a golden age

182
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:51,089
both forthright information that fiction

183
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,299
and storytelling being used to sell an
idea is

184
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:00,669
a inherent process that its something
people have

185
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,769
always die in a few need about an event

186
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:06,869
and you say that is too good to be true

187
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:10,720
then yes probably is too good to be true

188
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,309
I do not think for instance that
Alexander Graham Bell

189
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,608
with acid dripping down his pants and

190
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:22,989
in Boston said calmly Watson come here

191
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:26,289
I want you but it doesn't

192
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:30,059
matter to you know in in the grandstands

193
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,110
things other than to know some of the
events at the invention of the telephone

194
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,499
remind people about how that inventive
process might a piece of paper written

195
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,289
from a civil war man to his wife saying

196
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:47,209
chickens are good had a battle yesterday

197
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:52,299
looking forward to seeing you in the
baby perhaps he's hiding a lot of

198
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,059
information

199
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:56,179
machiavelli used battle didn't happen he
actually is

200
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:59,220
in you know that part where he saying he
was

201
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,739
on the other hand perhaps somebody down
the line will look at this piece a paper

202
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:03,989
and save this is

203
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,149
got a watermark a company that said they
never

204
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,959
aid to that side in the Civil War and
suddenly

205
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,230
all the amount applying he does has no
relevance to the

206
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,480
political information that comes in
there I

207
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,419
while talking with Bob Mahoney who was
the PBS

208
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,669
operator exact PC which bills itself as
the largest

209
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,269
PBS and the known universe

210
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:31,480
I at one point during our conversation
he said

211
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,739
yes I did this and I did this and I came
up with the term

212
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:40,329
sip I took this as a table

213
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,089
thing quietly and then put it aside

214
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:47,319
and said well how will I know this
because

215
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:52,899
if US bomber only the answers yes the
creator of zip Philip Katz is dead

216
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,509
having died in a hotel room surrounded
by empties

217
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,230
2000 he wouldn't answer

218
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,220
his mothers passed away a this is not an
easy question

219
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,959
unless you have all shareware CDs

220
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,649
some time ago I started collecting
shopper where CDs

221
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,239
in created CD that text files dot com a
site that's kinda funny

222
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:19,389
edge in terms what's acceptable it's not
but I have been putting up these all

223
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:20,259
shareware see

224
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,319
dating from 83 when they were just pack
some discs

225
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:27,628
up to relatively frequently relatively
new

226
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,369
and I found sip version 1.0

227
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:35,049
and in the Read Me file buried in this
arm

228
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:38,669
file from long ago he thinks Bob Mahoney

229
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:43,480
for coming up with the turns it and this
piece of information will

230
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,100
get out there I am and no way I could do
it was by assuming

231
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,869
that the information inside this file

232
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:55,269
wasn't a interest enough to

233
00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:00,519
arm falsified one of the things that
happens now

234
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,240
a very interesting situation it's
happening now as we speak it certainly

235
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,429
happen in mid

236
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,629
I in the mid-eighties on Usenet in this
happen now

237
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:13,480
is the professional troll and this is a
concept that's very new

238
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,149
and is an unintended byproduct of heavy
information

239
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,679
being available are information tools is
that you can have somebody

240
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,369
arm if you have somebody arm save this
movie is good

241
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,459
this movie is bad this product is good
this product is bad

242
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:32,389
sometimes amiram research on the person
who says this product is good

243
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:36,119
revealed that they have a money trail
that reveals that they are somebody who

244
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:42,549
was paid by an organization that happens
to make that product

245
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,579
what do you do if that person has no
affiliation

246
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:50,419
and in fact the reason they are claiming
things

247
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:54,619
is because think just wanna break you

248
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:58,449
they want you to waste time

249
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:02,009
I have a person who I dealt with explain
to me quite

250
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,569
earnestly and I must preface this for
the Sega reporting

251
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:09,110
that it is false but who explain to me

252
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,289
in all earnestness how the whole earth
electronic link

253
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:18,189
was actually the front for a child slave
trade organization

254
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:21,248
in which children were bought and sold
in secret boards

255
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:24,970
among the founders and that the whole
purpose of it was to provide the many

256
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,990
easy nationwide access

257
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,779
again this has turned out to be false

258
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:35,369
but it is impossible to trace back this
person's motivations

259
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:39,449
to some other easily motivated will
thing other than

260
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:43,889
she's pretty fuck opus zoo

261
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,059
the arm some amount of research

262
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:50,379
into Usenet into Google Groups revealed
that when

263
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:54,159
the space shuttle challenger blew up

264
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,029
in 1986 two days later she claimed that
the reason it had been blown

265
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,619
up was because there was a woman on
board

266
00:16:04,619 --> 00:16:08,489
and needed arm it was a

267
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:14,669
way to demonstrate to women not to reach
for places they shouldn't go

268
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:18,029
this generated some conversation which
is

269
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,509
obviously the motivation but if I had
not had that bit of information I

270
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:23,139
wouldn't have that Victor

271
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:26,369
and I could have wasted in of a lot of
time I

272
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:30,009
over time people change stories in your
mind that's part of the nature

273
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:34,509
things arm digital I artifacts the
comeback from then

274
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:38,179
provide people with the way to say we
have alternate

275
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:42,169
phiri's we have alternate statements
could you explain

276
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,899
this it's the question that their own
otherwise unable to answer

277
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,029
overtime because from everybody who was
at

278
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:53,220
haight-ashbury to everybody who was in
San Francisco in the sixties

279
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,550
to everybody who was alive during the
sixties to everybody who remembers there

280
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,050
parent who was alive in the sixties each
time the information quality

281
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,570
deteriorates granularity

282
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,889
information is a major problem right now
bomb

283
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,470
for example death

284
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,290
vegetable in the pie with the hit in the
face with a pie

285
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,659
on Friday which I must point out again
did not happen

286
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,080
all would happen on stage by somebody

287
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,470
getting in with a pie because it's being
done on a stage because it was ideally

288
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,660
chosen by the person fits in with the
pie

289
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,740
it would be recorded by what are these
two fine individuals over here on their

290
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,140
video recorder some of you might have

291
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,840
at this point a I the recording a

292
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,720
through your own camcorders or your own
recording devices

293
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,060
this event him being hit in the pod from
various angles

294
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,629
arm some %uh view have weblog have

295
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,300
platforms which speak to an audience of
four or five people

296
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,169
and you tell people about arm

297
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,230
what you experienced the watching

298
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,340
death vegetable with apply and what your
feelings must've been

299
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,889
death vegetable himself outside might
have pictures

300
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,480
up himself running away getting this
hikers of course the pie was made at a

301
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,410
lever hates and all these reactions

302
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:22,310
and times become this event with
different levels of granularity

303
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:27,270
because it happened here meanwhile
thousand conversations are taking place

304
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,650
in the hotel Pennsylvania

305
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,840
some which may be unbelievably important
from which may be the roots

306
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,750
I'll things that will change the nature
of information technology in another

307
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,400
5-10 years two guys bumped into the
Blarney rock

308
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,210
and said hey you know I know this guy in
the sky and later a conversation ensues

309
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,280
in which things happen

310
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,270
they'll never be a record that they
might and even mention that they might

311
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,260
say we met somewhere you'll never know
why

312
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,200
what was said what was happening about
it this is the nature information if you

313
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,870
spend too much time concentrating on it
you will go crazy

314
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,840
its a problem but I call the spa de
Flore problem if you have a floor that

315
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,560
dirty you say the floor is dirty

316
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,050
and deal with it you go air or you step
over it never thinking a bit because

317
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,270
what thousand people in never think
about how many people have been

318
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,480
on hotel slip don't do it if you clean

319
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,630
a floor or you clean something every
single step

320
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,880
made every single imperfection is now

321
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,970
wearing in your mind and driving you
insane

322
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,640
if you sit there and say I have some
files

323
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,800
from the aids from back when I ran my
beloved imports

324
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,800
that's one thing but if you like me

325
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,810
find yourself in the position it going I
have issues one two three four and five

326
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,110
and hi after a while you can go crazy

327
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,180
that 62 8 don't exist to my great
surprise

328
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,550
the I found the easing that was numbered
17

329
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:02,370
9 11 and 14 track down the original
office and found out

330
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,450
that all the issues they ever produced
and it was pretty that it was

331
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,440
intentionally

332
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,030
to cause trouble for people like myself
that sort of information just does not

333
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,010
pass along

334
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,610
arm when I was tracking back the

335
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,970
the route above the freeze K

336
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,190
rad arm care at now

337
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,950
has a lot alternative meetings like to
it kilobyte

338
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,250
red thousand times kick red

339
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,370
killer red that stands for

340
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,410
dark backwards arm I received a bunch of
that

341
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,430
I was told it was created in 1993 I was
told it was created in the mid 90's

342
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,930
arm I found through papers and
interviewing people that it was created

343
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,050
because it gentleman

344
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,159
on named Apple bandit spoke too fast

345
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,820
on the telephone and because when he
would hang up

346
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,950
he would say okay bye but turn into one

347
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,070
word and say k bye and

348
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,500
this was something he did so often with
his friends that they started signing

349
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,230
their messages

350
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,170
k bye and as surfer language overtook

351
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,280
PBS's in the early eighties radical

352
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,770
dude a bitchin started to make its
vernacular in

353
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,470
mostly because love Fast Times at
Ridgemont High and the valley girl song

354
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,780
arm people started to say that stuff was

355
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,270
K radical k cool

356
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,490
K see I

357
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,490
and when one group multiple groups

358
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,010
refer to their boards as K rad

359
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,590
on Apple to cracked screens that this

360
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,220
started to get use

361
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,300
know some people would say Wow

362
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,720
you just wasted 45 precious seconds of
my life

363
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,560
I am never going to get that back thank
you

364
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,879
big custom them has no value

365
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,860
to me it's not just about the word but
how this

366
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,400
particular meaning changes over time

367
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,780
until you have where its use now arm

368
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,760
in the meeting early nineties a new
group of kids rose up in Bolton boards

369
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,010
away Ring Pop descent the Giants that
had been before them the CDC's the Lodis

370
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,290
the Bracks

371
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,680
26 hundreds the private line does anyone
remember the private line

372
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,320
excellent the private line was 2600 BBS

373
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,669
it was seized I for doing very bad
things

374
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,710
arm early in its life I was seized in
early 1985

375
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,910
arm but June best part about

376
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,480
portable string Boston the New Jersey
area

377
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,270
but arm people saw these original

378
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:00,879
boards and said I can do that I can do
it better when they speak in strange

379
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,620
uses a ones for zeros I can do nothing
but that

380
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,020
I can do this ironically see I'm doing
it but I'm not really doing it I'm

381
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,129
acting like these kids used to do it but
now I'm doing it in this kind of post

382
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,270
modern funny way that itself with the
comment

383
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,620
and I have a lot of collections very
complicated means

384
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,740
where people are putting together these
ironic

385
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,850
events where they're talking about
traveling back in time to the evening

386
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,290
get there rush all a bit I just pull
down

387
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,470
I put it on my website i'd leave it
there

388
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,630
and week for what happened next

389
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,160
which I will have no control arm I get a
lot of

390
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,270
mail from people will again

391
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,530
I the problem that arises

392
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,680
of course is the viability of the median
which I'm storing it on

393
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,860
it's a very precious time in terms of
bandwith in terms

394
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,380
love our storage space in

395
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,280
1984 you could buy it ten megabytes i
tre Drye

396
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,740
which was one of the first commercially
available hard drive that was in

397
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,330
in a scientific

398
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,800
military in other professional pacified

399
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,960
store and buy it cost about seven
hundred dollars but ten megabytes the

400
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,310
nature of the Apple systems that you
couldn't have

401
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,540
subfolder so you had the kind of the
final

402
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,820
a bunch of large floppy disks but
because the seven dollars

403
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,100
ten megabytes and I'm bought 250

404
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,740
gigabyte hard drive for 159 dollars on
sale

405
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,780
USA two weeks ago in 20 years

406
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,800
we've gone from 10 megabytes

407
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,960
to 250,000 megabytes

408
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,409
I'm not concerned about storage

409
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:55,830
when they save Google when Google saves

410
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,470
arm Usenet news

411
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,269
the amount of data being

412
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:06,539
see this precious data this impossible

413
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,730
block human history was between three
and 6 gigabytes

414
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,840
not a big problem you don't think about
that now

415
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,010
when you're downloading an enormous
amount media

416
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,740
um one of the reasons I did text file to
Commons to turn all

417
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,010
the nineteen eighty text file writing
into aware

418
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,149
because to keep people's attention to

419
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:33,690
K file it's going to get lost now so
like

420
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,169
turned them into seven hundred megabytes
points

421
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,289
that get downloaded so I go

422
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,340
you had none of the history now you have

423
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,240
most the history on never have all a bit

424
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,260
I still get stuff sent to me arm

425
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,379
I was recently because arm part what
part of what in the PAP inning is this

426
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,760
interesting peacock affect

427
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,179
because I'm the fellow who's known for
collecting digital history

428
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:03,200
people who didn't know what to do with
their stuff send it to me

429
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,179
just DAF so when I'm called up and
someone says

430
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:11,389
I have 300 shareware CDs

431
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:14,630
I guess you wanna have 'em I say

432
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,120
okay and I take them and I digitized
they're coming to shortly

433
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,639
I'm coming after the library of congress
they visited his house in

434
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:27,220
copied them on left and i like it arm

435
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,220
when I was interviewing word
christiansen it turned out that at

436
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,380
on his desk in a small formal role

437
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:38,100
were printouts from the first month for
the first BBS

438
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,450
1978 that he had

439
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,570
kept not sure what to do with them

440
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,120
so he lent them to me they were so faded

441
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,960
I've been using a flash light to shine
across the indentation

442
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,889
on the paper to figure out what was
written and I'm transcribing it as

443
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:01,059
accurately as possible so that the

444
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:04,500
we're printout form is what survives

445
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,620
and then I'm applying it to my massive
700 Meg

446
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,179
a collection and saying take it all

447
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,049
there something else in there don't mind
it to stow away to ensure that these

448
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:18,168
words do they say interesting things

449
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,720
maybe somebody uses ASCII art to welcome

450
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,360
to wish everyone a great Memorial Day in
1978

451
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,490
someone at one point is talking to
somebody else and says

452
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,590
that is cool and rates k 00 L

453
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,220
in 1978 this all provides

454
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,799
information um that we just didn't have
before

455
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,990
arm and to my great surprise I had
printouts the private line

456
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,450
three months before it went under so
I've been transcribing

457
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,360
this may be one of the only remaining
evidence is that this board ever existed

458
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,860
arm so for me its

459
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,690
its it's very very important arm but how
long will it last

460
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,850
certainly there is a large amount

461
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,970
Wonka policy and debate

462
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,380
among people mom with very very tiny
voices

463
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,590
and very very quiet guys about how long

464
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,639
certain storage media will last in
today's world

465
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:20,539
a certainly if you look at things from
the point of view

466
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:24,190
somebody thousand years a lot I'll

467
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,169
mom history would seem like a mixing
bowl

468
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,510
where things get mixed up somethings

469
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,090
arbitrarily crossed on the side and
never go away

470
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,330
all jokes certain kinds of bricks

471
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,809
certain things while so much else it's
whipped up

472
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:47,490
removed and taken away to a thousand
recipes into you never know what

473
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,399
happened anymore

474
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,210
that's the nature human trying to act
like it's not that it's the great

475
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,679
tragedy a technological

476
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:58,379
people making human people non-human or
treating

477
00:28:58,379 --> 00:29:02,409
non-human me humans non-human million
trying to evaluate

478
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,539
if you spend time trying to treat people
like their a

479
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,990
value a certain kinda exponential

480
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,679
you know mathematical theory they will
always feel you

481
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,240
annual always be set instead you do best

482
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,370
organically approach like like everyone
else does

483
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,970
all things toward you that you'd like
for a way things that you don't like

484
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,240
or throw them to people liked hence
e-bay

485
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,159
bomb so I collect a lot of thing simply
because I think it might be interesting

486
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,559
I have my own personal biases I love
watching people screw

487
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,610
with history in a

488
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,760
kind do you know parodying manner I like
it when they make fun of things that

489
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,299
used to be

490
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:50,490
you can get their opinion I love
everything having to do with Apple to

491
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,179
pirate boards from nineteen

492
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:55,549
the 12 1985

493
00:29:55,549 --> 00:29:59,119
I love it can't get away from it it
makes me it's like the guy

494
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:03,389
luck Ferrari in the open up the hood the
new Ferrari

495
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:08,369
thats leave me alone with it for a while

496
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:12,289
because that's what I enjoy it at that
the time Mike you'll find

497
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:15,789
as I found in two hundred interviews the
golden period

498
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,080
is when you started using it

499
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,110
the Golden Age blossomed in bloom the
first time you did it

500
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,480
whatever it is your first call on

501
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,549
your first love your first car

502
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:34,230
with the Golden Age it had its flaws it
had its greatness but

503
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,369
it your goal and that's fine

504
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:41,090
telling everyone else that the golden
ages past is not effective in not

505
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,860
through

506
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,619
your golden ages past again that's fine

507
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:49,559
you know arm I happen to find that that
time for me is Michael

508
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,590
me that's when I grew up and I found out
that their lives outside

509
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,419
mine found that there was a stake of
California I found out that

510
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,899
that that people have cars girlfriend

511
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:04,820
talk about it have a great time I wanted
to be part of them

512
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,230
so that for me is mine so that comes to
me and I get them tonight

513
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,460
pull them away and you get these events
where people

514
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,210
mom a gentleman while I had a I had the
canonical

515
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,460
collection about text file

516
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,760
you'll never get them all but you can
usually say I got pretty much everyone

517
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,770
made it around and I can happily say

518
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,539
that is a 1992 I got pretty much all the
BBBS

519
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,940
that was a very important milestone for
me 1998

520
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:36,179
I couldn't find any online to I could
find

521
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:40,350
pretty much all arm and

522
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,279
I had somebody come to me and I found
out his story that he had been an apple

523
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:49,159
born in 1982 and that his parents at
move to Brazil

524
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:53,750
and he went to Brazil and then in 1985
they moved back

525
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,159
dad was in the military came back loved

526
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,580
time with Apple so much that he found
them again

527
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,830
found the Baltimore and he when he saved
everything he could from

528
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:07,460
every Baltimore ever could now coming
from the outside it was like the court

529
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,679
was like a time-travel

530
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:12,010
he came back it was all back collected
as much as he could

531
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,750
and so he put it all together and he
said I want you to have it

532
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,039
and it was like it was like the second

533
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:24,408
camcorder it was like the second point
of view that gives you the 3d

534
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:29,110
image was a set of one's responding to
the files that I knew is the canonical

535
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,809
one's going

536
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:33,020
the canonical won their shit completely
wrong

537
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,119
here's the real story arm

538
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,179
and so his his sudden perspective on

539
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:43,470
his golden age was what change things
for him

540
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:49,770
arm

541
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,040
is it true that stuff will deteriorate
yes

542
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,090
ten years twenty years thirty years
that's not your problem

543
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:00,430
again that problem for people like
myself

544
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,550
say have copies of my stuff put it on
the LTI tapes

545
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,360
put on CDs and at the end of the day we
go all well

546
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,430
we got alone we got

547
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:16,700
most this newspaper got ripped when it
got transferred but we have the other

548
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,800
four hundred issues

549
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,510
a if you don't save it

550
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,140
and by saving and I I'll explain that by
me but by if you don't do that

551
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,720
nope and normal rest 32 technology can
make something from nothing

552
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,370
very hard to restore a dodo you know
because

553
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,909
by the way does were stupid

554
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:47,559
I'm booked the walk right up to you
because they had no natural enemies

555
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:51,120
and it got to the point that they would

556
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,010
shoot the because they couldn't get to
the latrines

557
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,549
on the galapagos it be

558
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:02,750
let's go down god damn

559
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,870
dodo damn get to the latrine

560
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,710
now which apply some big amount of value
to the

561
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,810
to the dodo in the history and
everything else but you know the last

562
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,690
dose skin

563
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,589
but got destroyed in you know the late
eighteen hundreds

564
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,629
early nineteen hundred's you know that's
gone

565
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:23,730
however our stories don't know the
stories of things that were learned

566
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,990
Darwin's work I'm studying are Canary
Islands up

567
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:35,089
other islands like that learn about
species that persist we do our best arm

568
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:38,509
could a as a person

569
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,429
you know you say we're looking at what
can I do what can I possibly

570
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:46,260
deal are the sounds like something you
do that nobody else does

571
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,260
and my answer is if you enjoy something
on the internet

572
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,470
a joke site a person's writing

573
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:56,790
a somebody writes you unbelievably
horrifyingly

574
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,130
angry male just put it somewhere

575
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,339
drop it off forget about it got sorted

576
00:35:03,339 --> 00:35:07,240
the great scourge our people

577
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,150
trying to be the filter what's good

578
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,480
what's bad what's useful with what's
gone don't waste your time

579
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,990
nearly nineteen nineties it was thirty
seconds to render a Jay pag on on a

580
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,770
Macintosh

581
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:25,980
a so you can find out if you actually
did download

582
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,119
the girl

583
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:32,470
in Windows XP the default

584
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:37,849
view is a thumbnail gallery of all the
pictures brought up to you is if it was

585
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:41,990
just another page the process of sorting

586
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,329
the girls from all the Badger photos

587
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:50,680
is almost instantaneous now 32nd process
you do while you're on the phone

588
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,210
you sell ago better go better back then

589
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,089
that would be three days three days in
going to the magical

590
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:03,020
you you you don't need to do that

591
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:08,119
if we can go from 10 to 250,000
gigabytes

592
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,829
in 20 years in twenty years from now

593
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:15,690
we're not gonna slow down we're not
gonna get

594
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:20,079
arm arm I stand at odds with a lot of
people

595
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,349
when they it's a common activist
technique to tell people that if they do

596
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,970
not take action immediately within this
aspect entire way of life

597
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,440
hand and living and technology will be
completely destroyed never be seen again

598
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,470
you will lose it you'll miss it

599
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:39,270
and sign your that's true and not true

600
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,520
fights are made what

601
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,620
it has been the trend as long as we have
been

602
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,390
in existence are certainly within the
last 100 years

603
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,920
that there has been quick profit in
making it faster

604
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,090
easier quicker to take the world around
you

605
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,770
and making image a video in memory

606
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,800
remembrance a bit and store it somewhere
for easy retrieval

607
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,930
perhaps the things use will work or
won't work

608
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:13,049
you know arm we certainly have with
education

609
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,010
a II fully fully endorse education to go

610
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:21,520
well the new Sony Walkman is really good
all the Sony Walkman

611
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,880
uses this weird format boy Sony Walkman

612
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,530
hello you know creative walkman which
doesn't do that

613

615
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,240
they're gonna keep getting companies to
make them

616
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,680
a internal arm mechanisms

617
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,819
that will store things better will do
things better cheaper faster quicker

618
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,040

and by that I mean augmentative a

622
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,009
reality where you are pulling in
information all the time

623
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,670
to you text information people

627
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,910
import systems where you walk by a place

628
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:27,790
in electronic form of all the people who
have been there are read out to you on a

629
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,460
screen or in other some certain

you know people will do this

632
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,030
cuz they like it and they've been doing
it so

633
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:44,320
your job is to throw it into a little
box

634
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,890
let the box robot come forward in a
hundred years

635
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,049
or than 10 years ago through your estate
or go through your

636
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:56,410
you know your your equipment yes I was
gonna be thrown out but without that

637
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,069
important piece that you play being here
you know

638
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:04,510
do it and you'll always find it complete
maniac like myself

639
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:11,510
that will do this that will take your
stop and say

640
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,770
I'll deal with it arm it is only for the

641
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,009
effort to four people or five people
that Google has all the Usenet

642
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:19,730
newsgroups

643
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,440
are the Department

644
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,730
zoology a Toronto stored

645
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,280
all the incoming Usenet information on
nine track tapes

646
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,050
and it was transported by one gentleman
one day when you're going to get rid of

647
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:34,300
it

648
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,340
and that's how that information persist
out of all the people who had it

649
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,500
that's how they got it arm in
Afghanistan

650
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,930
there was a gentleman who worked at a
radio station

651
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,819
collected reel to reel tapes all the
Middle Eastern shows

652
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,890
all the albums all the radio and

653
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,259
arm kept them in this

654
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,520
beautiful little room where he sorted
everything when the Taliban came to

655
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,000
power

656
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,150
they out loud music and in that process
they would go to different locations

657
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,340
and destroy albums recordings this
German recognized this was not a good

658
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,000
idea

659
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,300
went through the tens of thousands of
tapes

660
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,830
in relabeled them so that they said that
they were something else

661
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,900
spoken word or readings of

662
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,490
different files and then put the spoken
words

663
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,250
in front when the Taliban came to
inspect his

664
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,300
collection he pulled out random Peyton
demonstrate to them

665
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,690
this is just spoken work when the
Taliban fell

666
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,700
while ago he then went through

667
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,070
again in relabel them all again

668
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,320
people like this exist they care about
it

669
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,370
to that level I think you'll find them

670
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:55,720
if you look for them online you find the
archive that or people

671
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,120
you find me the tech fall like omg I
you'll find the

672
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,759
will though use phrases like the arc hi
the media center

673
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,740
the collection the library arm the great
wonder about

674
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,200
the great the create happiness in the
great tragedy digital

675
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,890
is that there is one and now there's

676
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:19,549
to and then there are more

677
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:24,160
that strikes happiness in some terror in
others

678
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,520
so be it nature the game

679
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,920
take advantage of the fact that there
can be two and three

680
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,390
and and and given the people giving the
more you give

681
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,990
the more you there are I love that

682
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:43,280
I'm never getting tired of that and
every

683
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,330
every week sometimes every day

684
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,740
I get mail from somebody who says

685
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,220
I wrote a file

686
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,350
about a subject that was kinda funny to
me

687
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,350
and I uploaded to some old friends on
their BBS

688
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:05,770
you have it from 1982

689
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:11,440
one of those friends is dead I haven't
had that computer in 20 years

690
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,390
but you saved it from me and I thank you
for that

691
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,480
I get people to mail me and say

692
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,690
what happen with PBS's this is the
greatest time that ever existed

693
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:28,090
it sucks now with the spam people are so
much nicer back

694
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,970
that it was so wonderful

695
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:38,090
and I'm like oh yeah he really loved
each other

696
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,880
people love you know people come back
and the dive into this pool

697
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,810
I never put advertising banners up I
don't make people pay to click through

698
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,810
that's my choice somebody grabs it makes
a poor pay site

699
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:52,920
who read a it still somewhere and when
they run out of money

700
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,310
got a business someone to buy their
thing and optional go somewhere else

701
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,820
great

702
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,050
people go in and it's just that first
oshit feeling

703
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,140
jumping in the text files like on-site
and there's fifty six thousand things

704
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,589
for you to read

705
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,280
right now if you need to

706
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,910
it doesn't matter to me when the Sun
blows up

707
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:21,770
how much of it still rock it matters to
me the ten thousand people a day

708
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,500
who come in are affected by my
collection and without the people who

709
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,609
collected in the first place I wouldn't
be where I was

710
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:34,330
we weren't we were supposed to do Q&A
unfortunately looks like I'm out of time

711
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:38,200
we have time with the smile stage
manager

712
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,030
two minutes with somebody like to form
into question for me

713
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,900
just walk up to the microphone whoever
wins if your question is really long

714
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,000
winding and not really to me I'll stop
you

715
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,680
I just a as kind have to get over the
whole

716
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,649
a the media intimidation value text
files are comments 56,000 files the

717
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,660
regatta

718
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,029
up you know putting for a little text
files dot com slash 100 are my top 100

719
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,950
files to read if you really don't like
reading

720
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,350
yeah I've read that and also thinking
maybe you could do some sort of like

721
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,839
little message foreign people to post
comments things I don't

722
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,880
like forums for my stuff

723
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,250
because I can't run it properly

724
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,950
forming used to be a fun process you in
your friends did

725
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,190
now it is a geopolitical nightmare

726
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:31,340
I simply don't have the energy I
encourage people

727
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,070
II to start mailing list to discuss it
there's something called eighties BBS

728
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:35,670
list

729
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,070
ya on Yahoo and so on where people
discuss these different things

730
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,660
I like forms minute when I have to run
them you know

731
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:48,560
I i've watched Rob mall the be turned
into a gibbering wreck up a man

732
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,810
and he doesn't even care a

733
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,670
doing historical research some of the
most valuable stuff you can find is

734
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,530
people's personal correspondence

735
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:03,080
right given with email how widely spread
this is and how much of it is located on

736
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,340
individual servers

737
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,290
that are being properly maintained are
being properly backed up

738
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:11,150
is there any strategies that you're
thinking about ways that this

739
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,520
information can be saved

740
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,970
her wanna the the certainly for instance
people per

741
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,530
people generally put no way in their own
words

742
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,770
and it's very frustrating they provide
no meaning to their own words I see that

743
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,280
a lot certainly on livejournal

744
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,770
I think like jewels were the most
important things to happen in the past

745
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,130
five years

746
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,480
I think that are people talk

747
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,540
a lot of talk about why wouldn't be
really great if everyone got their own

748
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,310
voice

749
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,490
and now it is another all surprised it
took Annapolis

750
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:44,000
enough cats but that's the nature of
humans

751
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,570
that nature human coming on line is that
they do that and so great

752
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:52,270
are MIT research project downloaded four
gigabytes of weblogs

753
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:56,160
arm to do it I grabbed that database I
don't even know how to read it

754
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,220
I just grabbed it and put it somewhere
cuz

755
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,510
some point I was gonna wouldn't it be
nice if we had an example all that and

756
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,670
run correlations against it arm

757
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,920
I think that's all that is relegated to
never be found I think that sometimes

758
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,740
you'll

759
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,240
have weird situations where machines
will be decommissioned from

760
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,680
a ISP and they will take the information
on that horrible it's a violation of

761
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,210
privacy

762
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,589
but on the other hand its this you know
sense

763
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:24,038
you know that the classic problem right
our worst

764
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:28,240
our worst president I had his

765
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,990
papers burned upon his death why am I
forgetting his name

766

771

of an infection 30 days into it

773

look it up there are some very bad
president

776
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:10,930
it's not just this constant bar graph
going down

777
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,589
there are some Sacco's okay

778
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:18,480
busted

779
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,799
with digital media I can send you a text

780
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:25,220
saying that I came up with he read

781
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,390
1989 yes

782
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,529
believe that and how do people

783
00:47:32,529 --> 00:47:38,010
the I got a text oh I know that those
files

784
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,619
sources honest about

785
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:46,940
this being I do work for the wiki

786
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,089
are a done work for the Wikipedia I run

787
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:54,180
my own wiki a run to close the calm I've
submitted article to the rotten library

788
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,379
the run to calm library

789
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,890
I can tell you that I don't believe
anything anymore ever on

790
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:03,069
I fundamentally I fell for that

791
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:06,529
hook line and sinker fundamentally

792
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:10,450
the answer is I don't believe any ovett
arm

793
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,599
I just put it up and keep putting up
everything I can

794
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,319
at the moment its it's Bob Mahoney made
the zip file in another five minutes it

795
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:20,150
might turn out ok got pete seeger made
the bit that vial

796
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,859
and Bob only stole it from him arm
across the river over in Weehawken

797
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:28,119
eyes across the river over we harkin
their their arm

798
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:31,470
the reason to give Hamilton is because
the reenacting the BER Hamilton

799
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,940
a dual today whereby

800
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,619
r1 up Hamilton shot over boers

801
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:41,789
head and Hamilton was killed arm

802
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:44,859
there are three different conflicting
stories as to exactly what happened

803
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:48,578
some say that the guns were modified and

804
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:52,369
Hamilton was cheating and modified it so
that when he shot it the request was way

805
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:54,190
more than expected and wacky took it

806
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:57,900
another one says that he intentionally
shot over because he could not see

807
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,069
himself killing a man over such a minor
thing

808
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:03,558
and the third one just says bert was a
great shot

809
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:09,099
we'll never know I mean there to
secondaries were there but

810
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:12,319
they don't they have conflicting stories
we'll never know we do our best

811
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,690
we absolutely do our best we try to put
up all the information we can maybe

812
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,779
somewhere down the line will find a way
of knowing

813
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:21,089
arm inherently overtime

814
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:24,700
I am encountering more and more people
politically coming after me to try to

815
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,539
change history

816
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:30,240
the best I can do is grab stuff from
sources and people that nobody

817
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,289
cared about nobody talk to to get their
opinion

818
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,319
because everyone knows a lot of people
know

819
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,520
Tom Jennings who created by DOE not many
people know John McGill

820
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,609
arm who was fired on that note number
two

821
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:46,490
and I interviewed him so his opinions
really help you with Tom Jennings

822
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,710
because Tom Jennings is such a famous
figure in all that

823
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,049
what a strange thing to end on I like to
thank you all for getting up so early on

824
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:53,380
a Sunday to come speak to me

825
00:49:53,380 --> 00:50:00,380
I am and I want to thank you for
listening what arm

826
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,609
and the I also really wish to thank

827
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:07,380
arm Emanuel for bomb lasting through
twenty years

828
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:12,619
love back-biting in pain which is what
comes to anyone creates things

829
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:16,059
and that I hope that over time the Tykes

830
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:19,640
who look up to him and point an insult

831
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,250
the will eventually dream achieving
stature

832
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,170
yes thank you very much
