1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,720
an attack modified the name a little bit

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,630
to and I'll

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,240
go to WWW dot hack and I dot com

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,400
after after Monday more information
about this speech

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,840
site is really not design

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,369
to be a commercial site

7
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:24,750
anything like that more it's more like
my personal notebook right keep some

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,369
notes

9
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:28,519
maybe some ideas just brainstorm

10
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,859
it's not very organized right now it
works

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,530
no doc so

12
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,680
how many people were here by here

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,680
the HTK to welcome back glad to see
you're still interested

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,410
as you may remember at the each Katie
speech

15
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,519
I emphasized happily on software
simulations

16
00:00:53,519 --> 00:01:00,519
technology believe that picking an
attack was possible I prove myself wrong

17
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:01,289
to use

18
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:08,289
I'll your power

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,120
act now to all things

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,050
when humans accurately newly basic
building blocks all mad means

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,240
the Adams all things past

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,990
the fundamental theory

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,589
behind mine my heart

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:39,590
you can read into that all good things
are possible and all that

25
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,520
so what is now anti-technology
nanofabrication

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,119
I'll using cut also the words like
nanotech

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:56,120
net micro is one million Nadal is one
billion unit measure

28
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,950
we are interested here's just so it
would be

29
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,230
panel meter what is an enemy here its
one

30
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,340
million need back how small is one

31
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,430
billion me this slide shows you a couple

32
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,410
colors years the lose here are right

33
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,060
is a ranger measuring six hundred 10,000
Mike

34
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,270
then we go down the line we we get

35
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,400
name things that are smaller plants
pours by the greens

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,280
here small yet fungus spores by 30 my
even smaller we have bacteria

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,320
actual living bacteria 325 Micah

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,780
and then we have smoke particles and

39
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,900
you might even be able to see it but
there's an hour there's buyers

40
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,300
3 points or 0.3% thereby

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,740
like that

42
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,560
that week representation net now meter

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,600
here's something you might be a little
bit more familiar with diameter

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,090
hair it said average between 80,000

45
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,800
now this

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,770
peekskill here represents a hundred like
or a hundred thousand

47
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,020
man no one I believe he resides good
enough to be able to see the actual

48
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,690
molecules the scales hair but the exit

49
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,690
this picture was taken with a scanning
electron microscope at 200,000 Kb

50
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,800
and then a meter is small what is now

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,459
what is nanofabrication

52
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,849
nanofabrication sore has two definitions
depending on who's using

53
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:44,440
general industry and semiconductor
industry the general

54
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,489
technology is the fine as the
manufacture

55
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,870
by left member again

56
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,980
that cross-section here's under thousand
building circuits

57
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,170
which would fit on the cross section
hair many science fiction

58
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,560
and more more everyday science

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
fine no-fat as precise manipulation
graphics

60
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,500
on this site picture be we get there

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,180
looks like transistor

62
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,660
CMOS transistor and

63
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,200
on the the right we have a watermark
their year

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,950
to rounds here we have the semiconductor
industry and

65
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,700
basic science so

66
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,420
generating

67
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,270
device less than a hundred enemy
manipulating individual

68
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,010
or doing

69
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,450
are we there yet yet that yes

70
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,750
we are there m3 19

71
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,950
where small

72
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,180
on critical dimension it's usually

73
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:06,180
if I'm not mistaken the with

74
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,160
x-box to

75
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,820
expects to which is set to come out soon
will be using 65 nanometer

76
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,099
definitely a plus

77
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,600
see a lot industry leaders warned that
nineteen ten years

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,520
barry everyone knows barriers are meant
to be broken

79
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,549
6 here games nearly nineteen nineties

80
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,760
IBM spelled out logo using 35 such

81
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:42,280
they used an atomic force microscope
drag individual atoms

82
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,770
the non across nicholson's three

83
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,008
using atomic force microscope needle and

84
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:52,210
it took about 20 hours I do that

85
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,888
a lot of time and but it works they
actually manipulated

86
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,479
apparently present-day atomic I'll

87
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,599
atomic lithography is being studied all
the time graphics here we have an Intel

88
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,490
Pentium three

89
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,910
an x-box and image I can spell out

90
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,449
35 like missiles

91
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:20,460
again taking with a scanning electron
microscope

92
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,880
weren't on the course mines probably and
the image on the right

93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,479
represents IBM very simple logo they are
used 35m

94
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,710
image on the right little bit more fancy
little bit more

95
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,400
intricate we we protect we perfected the
technology a little bit more

96
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,199
in the last ten years the

97
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,130
atomically dog is growing it's a growing

98
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,260
positing that site

99
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,640
so this talks about semiconductor
industry movements in atoms around

100
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,620
building smaller superfast

101
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,150
but nanotechnology and now fabrication

102
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,870
just or something remember again that
we're building

103
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,930
which or small

104
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,370
and even smaller than buyers factory
transistors

105
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,690
yet are gonna be roughly the same size
some bacteria

106
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,730
or even smaller so we have we have
biotechnology or

107
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:28,260
all player element because we're
building such small

108
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,730
that opens the doors by biologist

109
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,220
something women an ideal that samich

110
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,750
along one of those developments is my
career

111
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,000
unlike a reactor is often referred to as

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,250
it

113
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,670
chip where chemical reactions created
for

114
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,720
cells Ron effects study on a much
smaller scale

115
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,430
most the time computers use the image in
the upper left shows

116
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,160
diagram up a the

117
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,900
a by attendance that night messed that
one up

118
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,910
step divided chemical reaction remember
exactly what it does I'm not a

119
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,750
not a big chemistry got myself but I'll
the

120
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,570
interesting was interesting thing is we
have several mixture

121
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,780
chemicals going on in animator size

122
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,570
or even my computer science channel's
and

123
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,210
and these channels are edged into glass

124
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,470
course I'll think of something dockside
but then

125
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,020
there's a point at which the reactions
studied and a computer chip

126
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,180
is but underneath after that

127
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,580
the materials travel into a section at
the chip which is weights

128
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,710
and that's pretty interesting because

129
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,070
now you don't have to you don't have to
take pistons which could

130
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,170
could contain Miller leaders in
milliliters and chemical and you can mix

131
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,870
them and you

132
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,030
end up with leaders or or even more

133
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,470
%uh waste materials up somehow this pose
that this could be

134
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,580
oxy using micro reactors we reduce the
amount of waste material

135
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,650
to a lot less and also imagine

136
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,010
a company has spent billions of dollars
developing new cure

137
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,240
for some disease but they've only been
able to develop several

138
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,430
small miles up they have to put that
that drug that new drug which may be a

139
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,670
life-saving drugs through and

140
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,280
an amazing girl test to make sure it
works but

141
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,709
they can't exhaust their supplier that
chemical or %uh still have to spend a

142
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,390
lot more

143
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,710
redevelopment by reducing in now
expensive chemicals

144
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:46,830
that are use we allow it

145
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,480
stretched budget we can make drugs
cheaper this way also

146
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,510
transporting a a toxic chemical

147
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,120
that must be used in a test becomes a
lot easier you don't have to transport

148
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,530
the leader other on an airplane you only
have to transport

149
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,939
maybe a small six inch box that contains
the

150
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,220
micro reactor with the chemical Rd
loaded this

151
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,540
these are actual circuits here in the
upper right

152
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,469
is a dying showing your tears and
Michael reactors

153
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:24,470
channels such last the bottom left is a
device made by a company called Nano gen

154
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,620
they actually produce these chips
commercially in actually

155
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,970
they sell separate computer the little
dot sir

156
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,760
are like pins on a CPU connects into
text into a computer

157
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,800
and the reaction is

158
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,820
study by years

159
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,540
so not only does now technology have
while biotech

160
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,060
applications and semiconductor
applications also

161
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,450
medical they're trying to build small
robots

162
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,230
brotha blood cell is 10,000 animators

163
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,320
cross for building circuits that are
sixty-five Rogers building circuits

164
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,090
anymore we're not building transistors

165
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,140
building channels in class building to

166
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,350
gradually building years physical moving
parts

167
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,380
there's a

168
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,540
obscure movie reference through that one
in there

169
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,990
actually the most colorful slot I have I
think on

170
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,480
Innerspace as a movie based on the
principle that

171
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,780
a small robot is shutting down and
injected into

172
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,250
into his body and

173
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,360
it you see the size that the robot in
comparison

174
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,510
some other things in size body blood
cells the bloodstream

175
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,120
koreans stunning but how far away are we
from that

176
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,580
that technology the manufacturing and
small electromechanical systems

177
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,340
microelectromechanical systems

178
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,790
memes these are micron sized machines

179
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,380
were were talking on a physics level now
they had gears

180
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,630
cantilever Springs class rotating
components twisting component

181
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,840
nanotechnology

182
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,060
are micro technologies is a more
appropriate term this

183
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,320
but it's getting shuffled in with the
nanotechnology aspect because

184
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,800
because it is so small and it's things
that are

185
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,860
being designed implant right now in the
future it'll

186
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,390
it will enable small robotic devices the
same size as bacteria viruses and cells

187
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,380
also memes is being export happily

188
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,910
in fiber optic technology the ability to

189
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,130
to move the flap or flex near and
deflect an optical beam

190
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,560
allows you to create up pure optical
switches and routers

191
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,870
something which right now I believe the
use

192
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,680
they convert electrical and then back to
optical you pure optical routers and

193
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,760
switches will make for a much faster
back

194
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,280
so here's some hear some more

195
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,949
ASEAN pictures some common stuff here we
gotta

196
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,120
got a red and a white blood cell the red
blood cell being on the left measuring

197
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,460
10,000 animators

198
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,020
the picture in the upper upper left is

199
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,840
a small year and cantilever you can see

200
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,290
its scale their I know not everybody can
see it but it's

201
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:26,599
its 50 micron in the white line what

202
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,050
what is also pictured in that picture is
pollen which is falling onto the

203
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,460
the cantilever sex on you can see now
that

204
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,950
when you're working with this technology
you've got to have a clean environment

205
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,580
it pollen with the fall in this year it
would destroy it's like throwing a

206
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,460
wrench into a

207
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,910
running v8 all the picture in the bottom
left this color eyes

208
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,469
most desi and I guess all I CM's they do
not take color pictures

209
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,160
so what what you might find out on some
internet sites when you do some research

210
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,250
on that technology is

211
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,050
artwork some art students like take
ASEAN pictures and put color to them

212
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,710
make them look kinda II sidelines the

213
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,160
item on the bottom right I believe is a
combination lock

214
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,490
that was developed actually functions
and has a three digit code

215
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,360
it locks into a set position when you
enter the code using

216
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,950
an atomic force microscope years kinda
interesting

217
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,610
reading physical security on micron
scale

218
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,820
makes it very much very more difficult
to social

219
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,160
engineer your way into the slim products
today

220
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,339
which use nanotechnology on

221
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,070
added a little bit a researcher in
nineteen look too hard for this but

222
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,480
these were some of the things I thought
were need that came up

223
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,520
chair at Silver bandages use films
silver

224
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,569
to promote healing silvers a great
antibacterial agent and its

225
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,740
naturally waterproof using now films
silver

226
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,770
over moon can promote healing

227
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,430
soak your rights over bandages are out
on the market now I believe

228
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,710
haven't seen the story a back the only
thing I've seen so far on this was the

229
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,050
the Wilson tennis balls Sharia Eagle One
national acts

230
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,830
Usenet technology creates more wax
articles now why would you want smaller

231
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,550
blacks particles neither

232
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,010
scratch or a roughing

233
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,740
Rockmart in your in your paint job you
wanna be able

234
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,880
to smooth that over make it level again
the only way to do that is to make

235
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,510
particles

236
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,880
Maulana that would go inside the track
eagle 1 Nadal axes

237
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,080
nano-sized particles blacks which bill
in the group

238
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,200
other waxes today use larger particles
which do not

239
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,100
and consequently do not scratch as well

240
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,820
Wilson makes has rackets and has balls
they make

241
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,650
a double court tennis ball which uses a
nanoparticle coding

242
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,990
trap the air inside the rubber doubling
the lifetime

243
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,080
a pedestal any tennis fans here

244
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,700
tennis balls are made at a natural
rubber in order to get the authentic

245
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,980
down to the tennis ball the problem with
natural rubber is

246
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,020
that it dries out within

247
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:13,230
two months I forget if it's to be the DD

248
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,420
for got that was months for me but
natural

249
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,690
latex rubber dries out using a
nanoparticle coding

250
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,440
they were able to trap the air inside
the rubber

251
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,250
keeping it from drying out and promoting
are prolonging the life span

252
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,970
without affecting the unique downs
qualities which tennis players

253
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,010
become accustomed to it I didn't realize

254
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:41,319
the manufacture a tennis ball is so
critical that it does make sense

255
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,030
nano dries a company which makes
clothing these this clothing use

256
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:49,360
nanosized particles to absorb moisture
prevent bacteria grow

257
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,640
I believe they're also using silver in
this department

258
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,939
and another example the clothing which
uses nanotechnology

259
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,080
are the new stain guard docker pants I

260
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,959
I believe the use nanoparticles have fun
moving in with the fabric

261
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,130
this this keeps the

262
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,939
the water or any liquid material from
sticking to the pants a problem with

263
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:13,949
those dances

264
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,050
after about 40 washes the the nano
coating

265
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,139
the nanoparticle coating balls of also
with the end and a dry cleaner

266
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,189
they only last for it that the wash is
awesome those commercials that they show

267
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,959
that I

268
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,070
all over the car with his drink all over
his lap and gets out it's perfectly fine

269
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:36,730
those a real others heads to work like
that it's it's pretty interesting

270
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,970
that's current nanotechnology these are
things that are being developed

271
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:46,210
right now that already exist these are
things which are real

272
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,040
what is the future nanotechnology

273
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,240
idealistic leave the cheap manufacturing
have anything

274
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,000
being able to build machines which
replicate themselves before building the

275
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,280
the desired object allows you to create
the object

276
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,389
very cheap all you have to do is build
one and it will build itself and then

277
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,940
build the object and then

278
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,660
disintegrate or extinguished itself

279
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,670
using nanotubes

280
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,520
nanotechnologies really exploring the
concept that materials with superior

281
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,250
qualities

282
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,320
we're talking a superconductivity
culture tensile strength

283
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,560
maximum flexibility without breaking
carbon fibers were once thought others

284
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,740
the great fiber which could do
everything bend anyway and and not break

285
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,840
nanotubes are also made a carbon

286
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,730
and they're being used in a lot of
objects day are a lotta

287
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,470
research today to promote

288
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,470
materials with their qualities building
perfect steel which which

289
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,610
can flex 180 degrees in return return
back to its shape

290
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,170
without having any track cracks

291
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,280
and quantum computation

292
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,080
this is a a catch-all for ultra fast
computers

293
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,649
I mean were talking

294
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,780
past three gig were talking the ability
to store

295
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,720
immense amount of data on small on small
medium

296
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,820
that's the good side that's the good
side the future math technology

297
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,610
some other things which happens shown to
be

298
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,620
dangers outcomes nanotechnology are

299
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,260
real myerses remember again we are
manipulating vigil Adams

300
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,450
what is a virus it is that's the special
arrangement

301
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,870
proteins water proteins a special
arrangement molecules

302
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,650
molecules special arrangement Adams if
we can manipulate Adams we can build

303
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,290
molecules

304
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,820
we can build proteins and we can bill
byers

305
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,780
we can also manipulate an existing
buyers takeout couple molecules a

306
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,629
one tight and put in a new one move
whole proteins around

307
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,580
you can create luper viruses real buyers
is that

308
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,189
exist in the real world that definitely
I I think

309
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,380
stands out as one of the the great
things that nanotechnology is capable of

310
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,169
doing

311
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:13,300
but is also dangerous sasser's genetic
manipulation

312
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,899
being able to manipulate genetic
structure any organism

313
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,929
precisely allows you to create such

314
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:24,169
crazy sign a science fiction things like
to Animals Act

315
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,960
are extremely bloodthirsty your

316
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,560
you know crazy stuff like that but being
able to manipulate

317
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,520
the gene that have an animal allows you
create custom characteristics other

318
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,820
so with that technology someone with the

319
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,860
less than honest intentions could do
that

320
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,110
and then also the goo scenarios I

321
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,480
these are scenarios which some
scientists feel maybe

322
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,090
possible I mentioned before about cheap
manufacturing

323
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,500
objects using self-replicating machines

324
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,169
if this if the machine is self
replicating has to take some fuel park

325
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,540
to create itself

326
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,830
if you did not design it feel to be
something which is unique

327
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,889
if you design it feel to be something
like sugar a

328
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,380
replicator can reproduce itself very
quickly if that were

329
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,360
let loose their sugar everywhere but if
you make a special

330
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,980
feel that it past them the break apart
build itself

331
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,100
and you use 10 the the chance that it
could break loose

332
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,580
and I what you have here is a situation
where

333
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,590
I there is a constant

334
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,740
everything that that replicator comes in
touch with

335
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,960
it is able to take part and rebuild

336
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,770
a new replicator which then course can
take part build another replicator

337
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,050
and what you have is a world ending up
in a ball and greener

338
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,510
great clue also green do

339
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,780
grey goo and blue do I believe are the
three main do scenarios

340
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,379
on yeah is it's quite interesting
personally I i

341
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,710
I don't agree I up smoking to some

342
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:05,190
some PhD people about this that I
thought it was interesting

343
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,290
and that's what I was I was told to that
it is

344
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,310
it is kinda sci-fi interesting thing but
there hasn't been enough research done

345
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,159
on it yet

346
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,919
prove that its its a possible runaway

347
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,030
cataclysmic event so

348
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,168
here we have the good and the bad and we
come back to the point

349
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:30,169
all things are possible

350
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,630
that's nanotechnology backing

351
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,230
reason we're all here today a hacker's
learn

352
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,590
explore discover invent bill and

353
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,750
a Austin hackers break the barriers

354
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,530
a technology when someone said you can't
make a computer that can do this

355
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,810
hacker said I will do it and they have
done so they

356
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,040
they break the the barriers a technology
that pushed the limits apply to an

357
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,320
object is designed for

358
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,730
and they also born the hacker

359
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:10,120
is a able to observe something which
they may feel in the future

360
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,320
could be dangerous they're able to

361
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,730
to get out and warn people right now
we're not doing so good

362
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,530
are warning systems in place are getting
other hackers in trouble

363
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,590
hopefully by the time

364
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:28,709
true nanotechnologies is realize maybe

365
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,860
Packers will have a better foreign to
voice their concerns

366
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,550
so we have hacking

367
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,649
with nano me attack now what is packing
Nana

368
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,270
actors

369
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,710
for nano hackers learn about
nanotechnology

370
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,190
read research experiment explore

371
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,920
look for look for information everywhere
they can

372
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,030
spread disinformation sometimes
information about Nana

373
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,540
that nanotechnology which is a very new
field

374
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,649
is obscure is actually sometimes even
secret home

375
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,830
so I believe the goal the Nano hacker

376
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,820
and ago love my project is to spread the
information about and technology to

377
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,169
let others know what's going on again

378
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:23,680
a to dispel some the the negative
aspects which nanotechnology may take on

379
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,840
that it's dangerous and that on building
crazy machines up here

380
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,189
I need to get out and air we all need to
get out and tell

381
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:36,170
people and especially the media that
this is not something to be a hundred

382
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:36,560
percent

383
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,178
feared it is the question then learned
about not not completely

384
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,260
put to the side as something dangerous

385
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,840
we're all familiar with that experiment
with nanotechnology

386
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,490
with little regard for financial gain a
lot

387
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,830
all my would say almost all the research
now technology done right now

388
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:58,899
is purely for financial gain somebody
wants to make money

389
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,060
somebody wants to make money off an idea
so in n.o hacker

390
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:08,600
would it's a hobby it's it's not it's
sometimes even more than a hobby it's a

391
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,830
desire a dry

392
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,590
experiment to learn to spread that
information and

393
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,409
to build new things with little regard
for actually making money on

394
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:22,850
we've all probably had situations where
we've sent from computer for hours at a

395
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,360
time

396
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,280
and that make a single penny from but we
come away with the feeling of

397
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,560
accomplishment that we've created
something good

398
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,360
exposed threats overlooked by profit and
power driven

399
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,530
entities power-driven entities like the
government profit driven entities like

400
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,399
corporation

401
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,310
corporations may be mindset

402
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,700
on developing a particular aspect the
nanotechnology

403
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,980
while completely disregarding the fact
that it could be harmful

404
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,140
for a nature are harmful to humans

405
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,560
actors with information about

406
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,669
and technology are able to to store look
over their shoulder and see what they're

407
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,260
doing

408
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,379
find out what their research and find
out what they're learning

409
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,840
tell other people about it see what they
think about is to spread it around see

410
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,200
where there could be a problem this this
to me is most like

411
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,890
finding exploits or finding

412
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,320
things that could be exploited so

413
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,530
and one of the other things I feels very
important for

414
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,160
into hacking is to enhance the life for
all humankind

415
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,730
we carry with nanotechnology all things
are possible

416
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,100
so I believe it's it's important for
hackers

417
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,310
nanotechnology to use what they've
learned to enhance

418
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,700
humankind because

419
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,010
the negative effects are so profound we
have to take the positive effects and

420
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,710
apply them

421
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,770
before their hold out for money or

422
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:58,300
Cornell for new weapons

423
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,929
so come back around to

424
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:05,190
packing and all things are possible

425
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,700
this is something the equipment their
fabrication

426
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,710
home any effective hacker has have tools

427
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,590
and effective nano hacker as the hat
tools

428
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,740
these are some these are some other
tools and equipment nanotechnology it's

429
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,030
just a random

430
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:26,350
collages objects the point here was the
show

431
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,280
a sci-fi looking device but also to show
that they have some things in common

432
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,560
they have I'll call the Chamber an area
where

433
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,060
the action occurs they had support a

434
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,860
devices and support systems you see
wires and tubes

435
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,169
and all kinds of things going all over
the place and then the

436
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:51,250
item on the right which is a an electron
beam lithography tool

437
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,530
each wire each tube has a specific
purpose in order to

438
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,350
treat electron beam which can write on

439
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,710
which can write on a silicon surface or
edge away

440
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:07,750
chromium on a glass surface down to a
very precise scale

441
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,790
all this equipment in here possible on
money

442
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:14,659
these are all pictures & equipment at
research place

443
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,250
and they had a lot of money to throw
around some the clinton's donated from

444
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,550
industry but I'll we're talking

445
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,600
hundreds or thousands her device several
million the evening till I believe the

446
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,110
several million dollars

447
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:32,730
a a budget which I currently am not
equipped to handle

448
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:36,200
so the next important thing

449
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,150
is what type of equipment is using
nanotechnology

450
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,130
here's a small list we had back in
technology lithography

451
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,480
plasma a electron beams ion beams
microscopy

452
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,800
and without the pockets a direct access
the net technology

453
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,890
Packers must build their own tools

454
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,970
when we don't have the money to paid for
a proprietary piece a software

455
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:08,230
most us writer on we don't just glad
stealing

456
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,750
heard that and

457
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,910
so building tools

458
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:21,950
how do we get started in the beginning
hackers created the PC

459
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,550
the there were research projects going
on for

460
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,600
what they were calling a computer
calculating machines

461
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,490
and Packers would take home some other
devices that were thrown out during the

462
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,570
course of their work day

463
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,370
home there eight hour shift was a they
got to go home they decided to take

464
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,370
something out the trash and take it home

465
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:44,700
and for the next eight hours and their
own free time try to make it work

466
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,390
at home they they tried to replicate
what they had at work

467
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,030
because they wanted to because it was
fun

468
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,830
it took obsolete or broken components
home and fix them

469
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,949
to hack nano is to bring it at the
obscurity and thus

470
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,290
secrecy driven government profit driven
corporations and

471
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:08,470
academic institutions and

472
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:13,370
into your garage into your basement into
your room

473
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,030
the slide with all that fancy equipment
bring the equipment

474
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,899
into your room become a garage engineer

475
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,060
treat that equipment and then use that
equipment to bill nanoscale devices

476
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,110
drudge engineers is a is a term

477
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,160
a friend in my undermine had claimed

478
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,090
on automated upper whatever it just
happen to be the subject to a long chain

479
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,160
of emails that we

480
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,080
way to numbers back and forth and

481
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,928
Sobhraj engineers that hacker mindsets
can develop nanotechnology to new levels

482
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,500
is breaking the barriers discovering new
things

483
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,630
pushing it levels that it hasn't been

484
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:58,630
C

485
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,139
me I'm a standard left I

486
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,710
and get onto the demonstration to start
building tools

487
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,750
one of the main question that was asked
while working in mind Roger are working

488
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,640
on my porch is

489
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,820
what in my building I'm really not
explain a I was building something which

490
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,919
is a a tool

491
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,400
but they want to know what I was gonna
make with it I was gonna make

492
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,300
it was gonna make anything until I after
I made it so I had to

493
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,910
I had the bill that for said the bill
the tall firs and now

494
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,510
I need to think what I want to do with
that tool so what are you building was

495
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,500
really hard question for me to answer
some home

496
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,510
some the tools I feel which are
reproducible

497
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,330
on a on a budget for I hackers

498
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:47,860
are back in technology plasma technology
evening technology I believe so because

499
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,490
they're

500
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,560
pretty easy to recreate and pretty easy
to observe the effects

501
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,120
on some other some other things in an
attic Knology

502
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,370
don't have an observable effect unless
you have equipment which you can see

503
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:00,830
that

504
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,520
these things are things which you can
see very quickly

505
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,720
and they're useful and also fun

506
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,810
energy back in backing lowers the
pressure chamber

507
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,800
I fill the vacuum pump using household
air conditioner compressor

508
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,420
plumbing supplies from the hardware
store

509
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,310
and creates an atmosphere with less
chance contamination

510
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,820
for future processes back and doesn't
really do anything by itself

511
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,010
but later on it will be useful a Asmus

512
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,370
for state of matter to highly energized
gas I

513
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,740
its contains neutrals ions electrons
photons and

514
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,340
many other things its sometimes

515
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,730
as Miss require back in the reason why
plasma is important is because

516
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,840
it can etch and also deposit materials
on an animator scale

517
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,870
Rana on micron scale an example the
plasma is fluorescent lighting

518
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,340
I get to that later evening technology
where can we get he beams quickly and

519
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,820
easily

520
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,360
home it's a it's a beamer

521
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,610
electrons accelerated towards a target
anybody isn't Electronix

522
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:13,480
a quick 30 e-beam to get real real fast
it's black and white TV

523
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,330
the single to single e-beam a cathode
ray tube is an electron gun

524
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,790
we we do it make some serious
modifications to a TV in order to get it

525
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,610
to become our

526
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,160
e-beam tool and have control over where
it moves because

527
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,740
a TV uses scanning and drawstring to
generate the image

528
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,060
what we desire is a single dot that we
can scan restor ourselves

529
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:41,810
and backing is definitely required for
electron

530
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,139
that some links here in gaza hacked and
I dot com

531
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,650
after I get home from this event and a
have the

532
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:55,650
for presentation on the Internet so
that's that onto the demonstration

533
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,089
normal start

534
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:30,589
beginning in the summer it's a

535
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:34,509
the rental car and pay very much money
for and

536
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,710
I started Armada Hyatt greatly

537
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,960
in order to become a I mean for me to do
my experiments on and build my tools

538
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,349
and be able to take it out to the 2600
meeting

539
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:51,010
lb 2600 anybody in crowd is why I end up
taking a lot of

540
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:55,109
the results of my experiments and
demonstrating their home

541
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:58,500
in the middle layer

542
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,650
is back insisting that I develop I

543
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,310
the compressor is over there the us

544
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,560
cylindrical black device using

545
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,080
standard plumbing equipment pain for
many any

546
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,640
a hardware store I created the plumbing
system it's a series about us

547
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,240
and and fittings also this cage up here

548
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,150
I can spin around this way inge this
gauge here

549
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,880
is a pressure and back and a john Payne
from automotive store for twenty dollars

550
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,290
on mustn't I think it's about the most
expensive piece on this whole car

551
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,589
that actually had to pay money out of
pocket for the balance work on expensive

552
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:43,930
there

553
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,419
peace and this the

554
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:52,490
this gauge goes from 0 to 30 inches and
110 PS I've never used

555
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:57,869
yes I'll miss only ever had to use the
vacuum a demonstration up back in

556
00:35:57,869 --> 00:35:58,680
technology

557
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:05,680
here will be that all around us are
fifteen pounds per square inch of

558
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,089
pressure exerted by the air

559
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:13,270
inside this balloon

560
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,660
and outside this balloonist 15 pounds
per square inch using a backup

561
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,060
I can remove the air I can remove the
air

562
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,660
that is inside the jar but maintaining
the fact there's two compounds per

563
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,879
square inch that's not gonna

564
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,880
line in other one what color you guys
like hi

565
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,680
Erica blue

566
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,980
are by removing the pressure outside

567
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,799
up the the fifteen pounds per square
inch which is inside the balloon

568
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:56,000
is able to expand I'll what we'll see is
that the blown well expect

569
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,230
using a a series of plumbing

570
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:04,030
supplies and the compressor come from an
air conditioner

571
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,530
witcha take to an air conditioning
servicemen have been to do not

572
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,569
kuttner condition are part and lead the
the

573
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:15,440
nasty chemical straight into the
atmosphere have some respect for our

574
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,059
environment

575
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:20,299
and so I'm gonna set the balance

576
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:25,980
for my test to make sure that the pump
is working its kinda noisy

577
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,110
and iight and

578
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:32,820
went on this can we get a close-up up
the gauge

579
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,210
will only be actually

580
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:41,820
able to see the numbers on the gate are

581
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,220
you we can see the needle moving money
that I

582
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,430
closes balcony sucking down on itself
and it quickly jumps to

583
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:55,009
29 28 inches that's

584
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,010
the Val are the alligators demonstrating
their

585
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,430
quickly I'll let me remind everyone in
Area C I'll be taking all this equipment

586
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,470
and giving a more a a more thorough
demonstration because I'm kinda rush

587
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,030
right now

588
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:11,240
I'm gonna open about for the chamber
clothes that have I'll

589
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,100
and turn it on I'm also gonna turn off
the

590
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,779
gauge Val because its leaky we see the
balloon expanding

591
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:25,710
and has filled the chamber because we've
removed 15 pounds per square inch inside

592
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,350
the chamber

593
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,049
I walk the vacuum in there with the
valve so it'll stay for a little bit

594
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:35,120
on I use use a rubber

595
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,770
for the ceiling at the the glass onto
the the baseplate

596
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,300
I not the most efficient way for a
vacuum seal

597
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,810
but it's worked for my demonstration on

598
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:49,070
another interesting aspect in this
experiment

599
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,940
is that when I open the chamber

600
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:59,940
and vented the balloon is warm to the
touch because the

601
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,990
the compression their crash

602
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:10,630
Trenary alright I'll the next
demonstration

603
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,640
will be a demonstration

604
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,350
a plasma a highly energized for gas
containing

605
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:21,140
electrons neutrons electrons neutrals
ions

606
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,390
and photons both times is a

607
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,089
the key word here inside of the
residence to is a

608
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,940
pass for powder on the outside the white
powder but inside the middle

609
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,950
it's been evacuated and filled with the
mercury vapor

610
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,100
it's pretty concert right now

611
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,250
I really do anything when a when it's
subjected to

612
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,650
the effect for the palace there's a car
so from then

613
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,330
and a which creates collisions inside
the mercury vapor

614
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:54,290
a which releases photons those photons
are in the UV range

615
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,630
and the strike prospers the pastors emit
the white light that rockne it saying

616
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,580
we don't have news about to get the
mercury atoms excited enough

617
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,319
start creating collisions and both times
we can use microwave energy

618
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,930
a

619
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,940
yet guys want then the lights I am

620
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,320
this is a microwave a common household
microwave I've modified

621
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,100
for for my experiment by cutting a hole
in the side

622
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:28,310
know this this is not state if you do
not know what you're doing it had many

623
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,000
hours a

624
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,650
a conversations with a microwave
engineering is explained to me some

625
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,070
other

626
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,490
the safety precautions doing it actually
wasn't gonna do this experiment

627
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:42,990
today but I decided that I would because
he reassured me that it is pretty say

628
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,250
and power levels were working where r
relatively low

629
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,590
I am now

630
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:54,930
you need filament inside a fluorescent
tube in order to get the plasma strike

631
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,129
because the film intimate the electrons

632
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,810
which start the collisions inside the
mercury vapor this too has been burned

633
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,990
out the actual film it in here are
vaporized

634
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,600
surfrider their black pallor onions in
this too

635
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:11,500
but the mercury vapor inside here still
good so by using a burned-out to we can

636
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,990
demonstrate that the filaments are

637
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:18,830
not necessary I some safety precautions
about microwaves

638
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:23,400
itself safety first I mean everything
you do safety first safety that a

639
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,050
microwave

640
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,630
I don't stick your hand in it don't ring
the door to open

641
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,220
with the microwave are don't think it's
at the micro work with the

642
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,619
door open

643
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:36,960
soft edges no no sharp corners no points

644
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,070
I have a square opening I don't know the
dimensions are

645
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,730
accurate I'm not Mike with engineer
first thing I have I'll

646
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,420
and don't touch anything in here as it's
very dangerous many many thousands of

647
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:48,990
Poles

648
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:55,990
on first thing

649
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,380
I'll and when you do my great experiment
on you

650
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,330
read enough to understand them you
should normally keep a glass of water

651
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:07,490
inside and tools or textarea extra
microwave Anna

652
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,330
because if not they bounce around in
this chamber and go back into the

653
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:11,390
magnetron here

654
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,170
and burned up very quickly on this
experiment will be very short

655
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,849
and at the term in that the water
absorbs too much microwaves

656
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:23,740
not give the following back so and put
this Mike without picked up a couple

657
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,410
days ago

658
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:30,160
I can afford them it first thing I'm
gonna do with that the clock because

659
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,730
this thing is still going into the clock
set order to cut

660
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,640
that i'm gonna set cooked I

661
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,910
and it's not good run for very long

662
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,609
I'll do it couple times in a row so
people get some pictures a

663
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:48,150
the danger here is that we vaporize the
film in center in there creating a

664
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,369
positive pressure inside

665
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:53,180
to an exploding glass

666
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,160
that that does happened not put

667
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,390
a incandescent light inside a mic with I
haven't tried it yet with Crescent the

668
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,339
do not put an incandescent light bulb
and Mike women turn it on it with a

669
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,330
prize the film in

670
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,770
creating a pressure on exploiting the
glass and it's very loud

671
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,829
alright

672
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,520
had

673
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:19,450
help

674
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:26,330
now I iraq is everyone ready

675
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:31,598
now

676
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,720
yeah but

677
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,039
its is the

678
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,039
is the audio system capable the second
on for those sitting at picture the

679
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:45,609
first time

680
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:50,529
I'll although other demonstration area
see after this

681
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:54,180
I am assigned to a by method getting
questions up a real quick

682
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,229
care

683
00:43:57,229 --> 00:44:03,019
oh yeah the significance of what

684
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:06,329
alright

685
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:09,460
I right now the plasma this was just
more other

686
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,910
showy demonstration but it you may
notice on my

687
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,960
on my card I had extra doubt which
aren't being used

688
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,759
I later on I'll be injecting a a

689
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:24,799
gases for their nitrous oxide or carbon
dioxide which are too easily to the

690
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:29,239
too easy to obtain gases I so I don't
have to use the mercury vapor I can also

691
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:31,049
use a nitrous oxide paper

692
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:35,200
so I can I can fill the chamber with the
gas and then

693
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,319
using another microwave mounted close to
the chamber

694
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,900
or even just electronics a electricity
electrostatics I could create a plasma

695
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,849
this plasma doesn't really do anything
except for light up the light using the

696
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:48,559
photon

697
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,170
but I if I were to a

698
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,839
ground a target positive ions would
bombard that target

699
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:59,920
and edges I could also have special

700
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,259
species of gases which would create
precipitation

701
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:08,869
and the positive layers of chemicals on
a on are you so this was

702
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:12,369
just the demonstrate that a what a
plasma is

703
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:16,009
here it is on was touching it you can
you can do that

704
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:19,200
on the car I just haven't got there yet
chair

705
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,920
alright at rate is that the key word
there and plasma technology that control

706
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,019
by be power the microwave but more
importantly

707
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,650
by the voltage and apply RTR the at the
target

708
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:37,609
also the pressure chamber

709
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:41,359
creates a a an important factor in how
fast

710
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,749
a an object or how fast the plasma etch
is our deposit that's why documents

711
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:50,210
the first thing I attempted to do one
because it was completely safe my

712
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:50,799
opinion

713
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:56,200
Anna to its very important I'll I would
consider the most important aspect a

714
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:03,200
nanotechnology is having a vacuum good
back in a

715
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,600
to make a and e-beam at a

716
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,460
black-and-white PV take the PV apart
please make sure it's unplugged

717
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,800
I extra take a screwdriver and rub it
across the back a circuit board or

718
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,190
directly short out the main pass for
america's I we're talking thousands both

719
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,050
again which will

720
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,280
kill you all after you've had those
safety precautions

721
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,670
achieve take me deflection coil which is
the

722
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,690
winding up copper on the back sometimes
it's glued on there sometimes it's

723
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:43,180
clamped on their break that I don't
break it off but

724
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,730
pull it off you can't this connected
because it's used in the circuitry to

725
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:47,770
generate the being

726
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:52,230
all for just pull it off and set it
aside now you have a single dot premier

727
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,840
contrast an year

728
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,380
your brightness down to the mean minimum
and then turn it back up to just have a

729
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:58,970
small

730
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:02,560
them dot also burn you'll burn the
phosphor screen

731
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,490
prime the next logical step would be to
break the screen get the cathode

732
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:12,230
a ray to a egon out and reassembly
inside a backing up your own the

733
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,920
cathode ray tube is a glass back it's
been pumped out

734
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,030
reassemble it on your on your nano car
and a

735
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,390
pump it down and turn it on and see what
happens

736
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:27,990
I also if you're careful what if you're
careful why breaking the

737
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:31,920
the TV screen do that there's a there's
a small note on the back

738
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,610
the TV screen if you tap it it will
benefit safely without imploding it

739
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:40,120
but I'll after that news I use a hammer
and some some protection smashed the

740
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,170
screen savers

741
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,040
apportion at the foster coated screen
set that in front

742
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,509
the e-beam and you'll be able to tell
when you back to create an electron beam

743
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:52,340
because they're invisible also to
protect the plasma

744
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:57,520
break a fluorescent to a outside on
break lesson tubes inside because they

745
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,340
do contain mercury vapor and the

746
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:04,450
boss recording his car carcinogenic save
cases a foster coded

747
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:08,170
a present to class and keep them inside
her

748
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,200
your back in chambers if you have a
plasma which is generating photons it

749
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,800
will later

750
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,810
last question I

751
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:22,240
chose a black and white TV for
simplicity a color TV has three

752
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,450
electron guns and I'm not

753
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:29,290
not a real big TV repair guy but I do
know that

754
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:32,779
messing around with one circuitry is
much easier than messing around with

755
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,420
researchers so that's why I decided to a
blacklight

756
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,450
you could very well use a color TV and
only use one colors or combine all three

757
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,650
but I by using one simplify the the
design

758
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:50,650
art absolute last question then we got a
rat a

759
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,210
my plans for the hack no project I

760
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,230
develop more tools I'd like to develop a

761
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,730
atomic force microscope an atomic force
microscope

762
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:05,840
and wanted the major goals I set for
this project is to recreate

763
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,220
the experiments from IBM done I'm glad I
D and

764
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,090
who spelled IBM using the non atoms and
atomic force microscope

765
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,800
I believe one people like us who sit in
our garages

766
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,589
and do this for fun in Eq exploration we
can recreate those experiments

767
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:25,130
we've we've achieved the major goal in
society

768
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,490
I so

769
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:32,380
area see and a little bit and I will do
this again and maybe have more

770
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,320
personable

771
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,520
hands-on a more personal demonstration
of my

772
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:43,520
like women thank you very much %ah

773
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:44,570
I think
