1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,850
Talon not riding on the bathroom awesome

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,080
and but this Sat this is hacking the
physical world

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,080
with John and Laura leader arm

4
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:21,939
i'm john leader editor of loan on it is
a magazine

5
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:26,179
eilat about weird places on Long Island
and Dom

6
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:30,079
the tow it discusses urban exploring as
a main thing urban exploring for those

7
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,380
of you who don't know which i think most
viewed ok I see signs of hands how many

8
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,160
people know

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,200
and now how many people have okay urban
exploring the scene things that other

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,080
people don't normally see it's finding
ways into things

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,239
that other people don't normally get
into its

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,790
alternate ways of getting around may be
going from class to class to the steam

13
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,269
tunnels

14
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,620
stutter you know the paved pathways in
the lawns where you're supposed to walk

15
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,780
and we're gonna talk a little bit about
that I

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,480
can everybody hear me okay good my name
is Laura

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,359
I have also been coeditor law now not a
tease and now been explore

18
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:09,439
for many years on the head then any of
you know the term urban exploring is

19
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,159
batting

20
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,759
Mb ever heard a bad thing this was
something

21
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,049
okay good this was something at MIT
these to be a text adventure game

22
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,249
just like them talk about mature
computing offices near you

23
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,048
but anyway are they the system admins
were trying to delete this scheme which

24
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,439
is called ATV something the file name

25
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,399
they change it to be ages and then the
people couldn't find it to delete it so

26
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:33,649
that's where it came from just

27
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:38,380
find little things to you know get what
you want unconventionally

28
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,479
well that's basically urban exploring
physically

29
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:48,479
and it is related to hacking I found me
a definition have to hack

30
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,340
it's not necessarily for computers the
term came from

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,619
long before computers were ever invented
it mean to do something in an

32
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,229
unconventional way not the way it was
used for

33
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,329
to get what you want to whether it's
going into a building for curiosity

34
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,619
Steamtown smart meant to be tourist
attraction schtick a look around take

35
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,250
pictures are meant for utilitarian
purposes but

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,260
using an unconventional get what you
want done

37
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,879
I've also found this definition ever
been exploring its many things to many

38
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,640
people

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,640
but this pretty much sums it up in urban
exploring does a lot of different things

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,239
to too many people first I'll raise your
awareness

41
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,879
you'll start walking around you notice
doors thence pipes

42
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,109
whatever it brings your attention most
people just walk run unaware

43
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,470
I'm so from sure summer he found some
interesting things even

44
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,810
walking around the hotel just looking
around teachers you start noticing

45
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,769
things

46
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,650
it also forces you to learn the history
places in to learn about where you are

47
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,720
when you're in steam tunnels how they
work what do they do with their dangers

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,079
what

49
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,189
it forces you to study and learn about
your surroundings

50
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,099
what are the coolest things

51
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,140
about urban exploring is it also teaches
you

52
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,319
to lookit ordinary physical objects in a
different way

53
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,489
it changes your whole perception this
building here

54
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,909
there was in opening band up on the roof
National Guard Armory

55
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:18,620
yeah abandoned now yes it

56
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,599
well there was an opening on the roof no
other way in

57
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,250
these windows you see an app you can see
that their party

58
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,719
go one more you can see the barred
windows designed to keep people out

59
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:37,469
yeah may become nice hand ladders and
this is also my favorites

60
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,069
this year is inside an elevator shaft

61
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,599
in an abandoned Psychiatric Center I
will mention names placer de

62
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,230
but we work this is one that they were
tales were walking around this

63
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,260
some basement looking for the stairs to
get up this is a 12 13-story building we

64
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,280
wanted to explore

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,489
so we have to be walking by and

66
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,310
John he says ok he peeks into this
elevator shaft

67
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,680
which to me look like a bunch of old
rusted cables and a huge rusted elevator

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,420
two floors above way to come down

69
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,790
well he looks like he's just up of a
camp on the stage we could try this

70
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,810
Alabama said okay very funny find the
stairs

71
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,289
but turns out we got used to it we came
in now the latter

72
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:22,990
yeah it actually your thought a climbing
an elevator shaft

73
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,850
or scaling or climbing in an elevator
shaft would normally give you thought to

74
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,699
danger

75
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,870
also the harbour fierce action was not
hard just

76
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,650
climb that the latter folger shop into
the ledge the elevator door I didn't

77
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,830
bend backwards by

78
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,430
apparently previous visitors it wasn't
too hard

79
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,190
that's a picture the elevator shaft he
saw also

80
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,870
urban explorers too many things there
are some people that will explore

81
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,780
abandoned railroad spurs

82
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,229
which is not and I will ship a
trespassing or not sometimes it is

83
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:52,789
sometimes it's not it depends on

84
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:56,880
we talk to I guess but I is not always
trespassing however

85
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,500
a lot of it is this is an example of
time the

86
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,639
include the steam tunnels that run
through most live campuses people to

87
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,240
explore live steam tunnels nice 125
degree temperatures

88
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,789
sometimes also abandon steam tunnels and
also people anyone ever

89
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,979
have a trip to the new york city
abandoned subway since

90
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,550
also card

91
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,000
and then also there's a work exploring
abandoned buildings we found this

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,410
hallway in other bands like center I
call this rainbow call because

93
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,560
everyone's got a different color

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,979
and you just find interesting things you
walk around you start to feel the five

95
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:38,310
what the place once was what it could be
what you used to be here

96
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,229
what they used to have been here since
I'm sure look at people work in things

97
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,550
that they leave around

98
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,610
nothing and now one I haven't really

99
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,830
enjoyed very much I prefer to keep my
feet mostly on the ground as a half till

100
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,710
but there's something called filtering
richest people actually urban explorer

101
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,370
by scaling the sides of buildings

102
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,039
and getting as high as you can and
sometimes a scale

103
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,300
other things this guy appear

104
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,990
with skill anything I don't care how
high was we ran into a min

105
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,099
I was just in awe but that's another
aspect of urban exploring its many

106
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,840
things

107
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,139
also even this year even if you're in a
public area were

108
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,539
you're allowed to be you can also urban
explorer

109
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,240
by looking around your surroundings this
was found at suffolk community college

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,639
in brentwood

111
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,550
this says psh that means pilgrim state
hospital that campus was once used by

112
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,069
a mental institution and just walking in
the street you see these think so

113
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:41,530
it's really related to hacking as far as
when you see a computer system

114
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,720
you wanna get curious you wanna play
around see what's in there you know you

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,870
wanna learn that this

116
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,229
different systems in and everything it's
the same way with buildings its

117
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:52,270
curiosity its desire to document the
history

118
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,840
and you do things on conventional even
slip in cracks if people would mean only

119
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,770
think you can get in basement windows
vans whatever

120
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,878
it's not what it's intended to be but
it's gives you a sense of satisfaction

121
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,810
that you've seen something that most
people do not

122
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,289
I'm and talk a little bit about legal
issues aside on this

123
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,639
I'm sure that a lot of you realize that
there must be something

124
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,780
arm one of the lucky things is opposed
to computer trespassing

125
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,870
most to the trespassing charges not all
but a lot are misdemeanors

126
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,250
whereas with computer trespassing the
slap felonies on there so that's

127
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,580
one bitter relief a little I guess her
arm

128
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,878
as long as you know you're intelligent
about yourself

129
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,979
arm you look like you belong you're not

130
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,120
doing anything you know asshole like
excuse my language

131
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,340
are usually if you do get caught which
is rare your risk it all to leave

132
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,330
whereas you know if you get caught
trespassing on a computer to be a lot

133
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,639
worse

134
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,189
arm I'm gonna try to give the Los Feliz
my area and I'm not a lawyer so don't

135
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:56,569
take my advice is legal advice on just
gonna give things that I found on the

136
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,069
web in a min a quote them

137
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,740
and you can interpret that how you see
fit

138
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,319
arm just shoot this trespass in this
criminal trespass lot of people are

139
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,500
confused on this from my research

140
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,240
at it appears the trespass is more of a
civil thing you can be sued for

141
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,349
trespassing on someone's property

142
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:16,650
they can sue you for on anything that
you know

143
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,569
you might have caused damage to win
getting there which is a whole nother

144
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:22,229
legal issue where they could use to you
just for being there when you're not

145
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:23,750
supposed to be

146
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,280
om and criminal trespass is when you're
actually brought

147
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,990
and charged as a as a criminal in the
district attorney decides to prosecute

148
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,870
it

149
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,070
arm trust criminal trespassing

150
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,169
is being in a place you not supposed to
be at

151
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,799
doesn't have to be posted it doesn't in
most places it doesn't have to be posted

152
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,019
it just has to be somebody else's
property I don't know about you but my

153
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,720
house doesn't say no trespassing on it
yet if you order

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,740
I love my door lock you just walked into
my house

155
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,490
it'll be trespassing so it does make it
a little bit more worse

156
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,959
if you get caught and it's posted or
somebody tells you not to be there

157
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:03,839
because then it's obvious you at full
intent and even if it's not unwritten

158
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,000
law you are going to get treated a lot
more harshly if it's if it's posted

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,529
obviously

160
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,860
this in New York their second degree in
first-degree trespassing

161
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,220
second-degree trespassing is what I just
mentioned it's being someplace you not

162
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,920
authorized to be

163
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,550
in New York first-degree trespassing is
a felony

164
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,730
the first second-degree is a a
misdemeanor and what makes this a felony

165
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,040
is you have a armed are an arm on you a
firearm

166
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,319
are being on somebody's property legal
with a firearm

167
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,310
is makes it a felony on top of whatever
charges you might get for having a

168
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,510
firearm

169
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,029
bottom line a few urban explore you
really don't need weapons everybody

170
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:45,410
says all your own independent hit places
you can have crackhead running out of

171
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,189
closets trying to kill you

172
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,810
I have been in over 300 places and I've
never had anybody try to kill me once

173
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,940
I've usually don't even run into people

174
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:02,940
I've explored in the Bronx have explored
in Brooklyn I explore all

175
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,100
I'll take questions afterwards

176
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,480
other possible crimes associated with
urban exploring

177
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,600
on also breaking and entering now these
these laws might be a little shocking to

178
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,720
some people breaking and entering what
do you picture are you picture

179
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,970
you know somebody in a ski mask breaking
a window with a rock or

180
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,050
prying a door off or picking a lock not
true

181
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,350
if you turn the doorknob to open the
door you just broken entered a few not

182
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,300
allowed to be there

183
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,500
breaking and entering in most states has
the slightest

184
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,110
amount of force used above and beyond
just walking in

185
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,600
to gain entry if you push a board to the
side without breaking it you're very

186
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,950
careful about that

187
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,529
and you put it back in place after
you're done you just broken entered

188
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,339
if you open a door the sign says No
Trespassing you walk in

189
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,490
you had to turn the doorknob an open the
door you may have just

190
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,470
for broken entering which can be charged
on top in the trespass

191
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,769
burglary a lot of people picture a
picture right away somebody taking your

192
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,649
TV set walking down the street with

193
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:03,880
real sneaky like not not true if you

194
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,620
if you break and enter with the purpose
to commit another crime

195
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,200
even if that other crime is not theft
you are now guilty of burglary

196
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,810
I know somebody in and New Jersey that
was running a website

197
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,360
that was charged with this and I believe
don't put me on this I believed

198
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,079
that arm other crime was the loitering
inside once he got there so just going

199
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,380
in

200
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,420
and breaking and entering the code
automatically charges burglary pretty

201
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,760
much because

202
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,860
you know you are committing another
crime once inside your loitering near

203
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,300
trespassing bizarre you know other
things you're doing

204
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,899
I'm down to talk about more the fun
stuff now we got the legal

205
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,040
issues at the way and %uh finding places
terrible urban explorer one

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,089
one way to do it in your area arm might
not be advisable because it

207
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:56,220
you know does lead to dangerous places
is to look up Superfund sites

208
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,430
for the Superfund sites are those listed

209
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,740
I by the government as toxic

210
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,980
that stuff has been dumped there it is
on maintained

211
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,170
and usually those are abandoned
sometimes not

212
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,279
on I would recommend only going for the
bad ones you don't wanna

213
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,839
go to a place that has harmful chemicals
still use

214
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,199
especially with the craziness that's
going on today but arm

215
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,269
that picture there in the middle is our
that's world

216
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,639
like most other Roman world war two
planes were made its sits there

217
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,440
abandoned

218
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,899
they have chemicals all around so it was
listed as a Superfund site

219
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,010
arm some web sites where you can use to
%uh find places to explore a great

220
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,459
resource is a lot of explores a Canada
and one of them is our

221
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,470
you we r .ca and arm

222
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,040
they have a database of places that
people put to explore the only problem

223
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,010
with that is

224
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,910
when somebody finds a new place it's
really really call they usually don't

225
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,069
put on the database right away until

226
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,420
they've been there a thousand times
taken pictures have every piece of dust

227
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,510
and everything cool

228
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,839
because you don't want everybody else
showing up in ruling it the

229
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,260
so you try to keep places a secret until
it's finished and then

230
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,240
you can like look at this this place is
cool

231
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,170
arm but the best the best way to find
places as you drive around your area

232
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,720
keeping awareness about you like look
around liked you pass the building with

233
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,740
the boards on it every day is an old
book

234
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,560
what what history does it have maybe go
to the library and ask about it

235
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,880
it might be a place that's you know
interesting where the ever been

236
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,110
exploring

237
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,170
now finding ways in once you find a site
this is considering the site is a legal

238
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,980
that you're not allowed to be there that
you shouldn't go there are not advising

239
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,889
you to go there

240
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,290
I'm advising you not to but this is how

241
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,029
somebody might find a way and if they
did choose to by a little Mike

242
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,740
the what you do is I come if it as a
fence around it

243
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,100
I'm go into the area that's hardest to
get to around the fence like

244
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,839
if you see like an area that's right on
the street chances are there's not gonna

245
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,610
be any openings there cuz

246
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,000
the person who owns the abandoned
property

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,620
would probably repair the pretty quickly
are you want to go to a place people are

248
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,170
lazy

249
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,839
where they don't wanna go to repair
itself if this prayer tracks and there's

250
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,240
a

251
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,290
all Russian it's like debris in its a
carton dangerous to climb over and get

252
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:11,930
to it

253
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,290
that's for a hole in the fence is clipe
that's where you can climb through with

254
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,060
the fences

255
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,110
barb wired that's where the barbed wire
is gonna be

256
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,240
busted in stripped of I

257
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,660
to get into buildings once you get past
the fence um

258
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:31,500
don't think right away if polling boards
of or or usually work is not required

259
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,399
I I advise that you don't do any this
but if you didn't do it

260
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,670
and you have to do work to get in the
building do something so you can repair

261
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,350
it after which just that a respect for

262
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,870
the the security cuz they can get in
trouble supporter of all the time they

263
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,620
get a lot of slack fortin

264
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,680
that rolls downhill back to the urban
explorers of aboard comes off make sure

265
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,269
it goes back on also you you want to
keep

266
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:57,070
in a lesser intelligent people at a an
entrance you created because they're

267
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:57,610
gonna get hurt

268
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,880
side and its gonna bring a whole world
ship down a

269
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,660
I guess it affords again go to the
hardest place around the building

270
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,389
the place its most difficult to go to
unlock in places where other people

271
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:09,759
wouldn't like

272
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,769
look into basement wells like if it goes
down 45 feet jump down there

273
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:16,149
that's where the board is going to be
open that's where you gonna be able to

274
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,300
get it into an abandoned building

275
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,290
up because people you know they lazy
don't repair these as much

276
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,699
they might not even notice them our I've
seen plenty of entrances that

277
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,819
I haven't even may be used and

278
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:33,389
they've been there for years and just
nobody notices and even teenagers that

279
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:35,170
to urban exploring in

280
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,579
they permeate every other site they
don't find these entrances cuz they

281
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:42,480
look for the more common ones I'm

282
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,110
padlocks I am if you know how to pick
them

283
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,420
do so are cutting them as bad because
like

284
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,430
alright well picking them is is also
adds another crime in that you now have

285
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,310
tools burglary tools which as a whole
nother felony in

286
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,500
home other bullshit so maybe I shouldn't
terry towels around

287
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,850
job sometimes only the hinge if it's an
abandoned building it'll be so

288
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,959
rotted that you can just trying to take
the hinge often the door will open with

289
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,740
padlock still on it

290
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,600
and then you're a burglary tools you
still breaking and entering Europe tolls

291
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,279
I'm and I I would recommend if you do

292
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,550
urban explorer don't go in any building
where you can you know repair the

293
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,220
entrance

294
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,509
better arm some ways have
computer-assisted exploring

295
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:31,560
arm top ozone on as a great website and

296
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,480
it allows you to pop USGS top a logical
maps which show you wanna

297
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,779
by recently I i heard about early call
psych central wanted to see

298
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:43,639
and our I couldn't find exact directions

299
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,740
a lot of people they email me because I
run the site now like

300
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,130
how do I know the address you know
abandoned buildings

301
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,250
they might have addresses but im you
don't know them

302
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,269
are you can look up top ozone and the
top a logical maps because

303
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:00,459
the US on United States only creates
them every so often there

304
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:04,480
outdated so like you'll see buildings
that were aren't there anymore and

305
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,130
they're great for

306
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,710
doing research urban explorers like to
do research to when you find a site you

307
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,680
go into it

308
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,320
if you're really passionate about half
the stuff you do is gonna be off-site

309
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,649
and some archive somewhere in a museum
looking through old pictures

310
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,370
comparing it to the way it is now like
oh wow that's changed machain just

311
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:26,730
another way you can get a real use a lot
of you probably know is clover Explorer

312
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,720
on MapQuest had awesome access to global
explore up till recently

313
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,740
and they took it down publish something
to do with bush saying that that was a

314
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,790
you know aerial maps were terrorised
whole so

315
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,920
now you can go directly to global
explore and get it but it's a smaller

316
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,860
map

317
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,760
they limited many ways and they have
much more water marks all over that make

318
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,060
it hard to read

319
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,120
a Microsoft most sorry about mentioning
them but our

320
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,420
they have terrace server which it
actually pretty good but they're a

321
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,330
little dated a black and white

322
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,669
but are they microsoft did a really good
job but you can get large

323
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,930
aerial views and the whole thing is if
you use all three of these together

324
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,510
you can get like a detailed history of
the place

325
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,620
on this is a hospital that I was looking
for kinda blurred out the name per cent

326
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,730
about exact locations and on this
hospital had something

327
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,310
that's called Kirkbride her pride was a
leader up psychiatric care in the

328
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,820
eighteen hundreds and

329
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,290
he developed this thing where although
mental patients with live like a family

330
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,960
and it would be like a mile-long
buildings that are connected you can

331
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,340
kinda see that

332
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,199
in there and the director would live in
the center in all the patients off to

333
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,270
the side

334
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,540
God the Father in the center in the
extended family of the side and he also

335
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,510
believe that these buildings should be a
static

336
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,629
because to for recovery patients should
be in a setting that looks

337
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,790
relaxing nice so they were consequently
built like castles

338
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,850
so I pulled an aerial map ovett which
was from 1995 and sure enough I could

339
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:53,130
see

340
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,330
Kirkbride was still intact if you look
at the top center

341
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:59,610
kinda see the outline ovett along with a
few with the other buildings that are in

342
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,170
the top on map

343
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,660
and you can also look at the shadows in
Telford a huge building or a low

344
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,730
building like if you look at the one

345
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,910
to the cell in the center you can see it
has like a kind a large shadow on in

346
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,900
fact that a 10-story building that's

347
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,340
fully abandon in 2001

348
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,340
I am and there's the Kirkbride

349
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,340
one put these two maps together find it

350
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:28,070
that was the resulting picture

351
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,639
on little bit a safety while urban
exploring some other things will come in

352
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,660
contact with

353
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,600
more more often than artists pastors
it's a it's a small

354
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,190
fiber that most filters will not filter
out when it gets into your lungs and it

355
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,540
stays there

356
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,139
and over time it builds up its a
cumulative thing and its interview many

357
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,080
things that irritate stallone's

358
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,560
Anna minimum can give you head for SEMA
at its worst

359
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,889
it can give you lung cancer and this
several other diseases it causes

360
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,950
cost causes but I'm not a doctor I'm

361
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,140
one of the best protections against that
is in a special smashed I recommend

362
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,490
a respirator like the one in the picture
if you're only gonna do it once they

363
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,620
sell these cloth ones at Home Depot
select for box it's better than nothing

364
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,880
it's not gonna really be rated for
protecting you can suspect this but

365
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,250
by the thicker ones and how you properly
put these on

366
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,020
is this you take it easy to put on a lot
of people that I go with a look at it

367
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,950
now I call

368
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,600
getting tangled in it has two straps a
good one will have two straps because

369
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,310
the thing

370
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,070
the problem with these is the specialist
at around it because it's that small so

371
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,840
a better we'll have to strap someone
goes on under the years

372
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,070
the other one goes on over the years and
it has a piece a metal on the top the

373
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,460
kinda

374
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,910
you bend around your nose to make a
tighter fit

375
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,990
Animal Protective somewhat

376
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,990
another thing you have to constantly be
be looking on the floor

377
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,310
don't go in a place that's dark without
a flashlight it's not because the Boogie

378
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,270
man's gonna jump out to get rich because

379
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,350
in a three-inch nails gonna stick into
your foot and and catcher

380
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,130
and so always always use a flashlight
this here is

381
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,210
it's great for taking pictures and dark
places on a little bit about

382
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,210
urban exploring photography to because
sometimes you're in a place that you

383
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,430
know is all boarded up its not meant for
people to be in so there's absolutely no

384
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,140
light no electricity

385
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,140
and even with the camera you and a
tripod you kinda have trouble taking a

386
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:21,930
picture

387
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:25,860
this is a2 million Kendall

388
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,260
power flashlight actually this is my
want one point

389
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,770
25 million but pretty much the same
thing our

390
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,020
to bring something like this and then
you have it altered LED light so you

391
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,300
don't kill the battery then wanna take a
picture

392
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,610
to help at your flash

393
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,610
arm you also to look out for these
places are meant for people to be in any

394
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,470
more

395
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,430
so this holes in the roof water gets in
the sea the the floor to ceiling become

396
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,780
such saggy

397
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,550
on on heavy guy and I've walked and %uh
fell through for once

398
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,379
and its it's good to know how to deal
with yourself in those situations when

399
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,270
you're on a bed for you feel the force
but you can usually tell

400
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,610
as it'll be wet and buckled in some
places or

401
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,110
yes any reason to believe that the floor
is not good

402
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:12,410
you want to create as much distributed
weight as possible so

403
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,790
if your gonna walk walk with your legs
spread out as far as you can

404
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:19,780
so that the wait is on two parts if it's
a really bad for get down on all fours

405
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,879
and crawl you'll get dirty it's nasty

406
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,410
gotta watch for for nails but it's
better than falling through the floor

407
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,990
arm another thing you can you trying to
do is look for the beams

408
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,770
part to the four missing and try to walk
on those more and just a lot of common

409
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,620
sense goes a long way

410
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,370
another problem is like poison ivy Intex
and all those things are outside the

411
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:41,900
hospital

412
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,930
you know you not just fly into these
places you have to walk towards in

413
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,020
Russian stuff like that and our it's
good to know about poison ivy looks like

414
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,220
a special if you're highly

415
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,910
allergic to it as put poison ivy like
three times likelier

416
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,000
wasn't that bad but you know it is kinda
nasty

417
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,360
on poison ivy is actually a little bit
hard to identify the only thing that

418
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,450
to never be said for does it comes with
three leaves on

419
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,830
like like in the picture but people tell
you what I wish I know that's not true

420
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,460
you can see a picture here

421
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,780
up one point and I the one who leaves
shiny and the other two are not

422
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,870
they can also be all three leaves not
shiny and the leaves can have all

423
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,170
different shapes there's all different
variants

424
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,250
and Tex you pretty much know what they
look like when you get home

425
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,510
take a shower to get all you know the
garbage of whatever like

426
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,650
you know you gotta look for them because
especially on long island you can get

427
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,970
your tech disease which is nasty

428
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,190
I am

429
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,140
and document cites what do you do once
you get it com

430
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,620
photography is a great thing you there's
so many different colors in an abandoned

431
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,680
building to the way the paint chips

432
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,770
and this just so many different things
to see

433
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,129
like an angle looking out a window in a
building that's not used in the way it

434
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,640
reflects of pictures on the Ford

435
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,010
this really lot of artistic stuff out
there you should on the web and see

436
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,300
something that

437
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,550
on because the darkness you're gonna

438
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,230
you'd most likely will need a tripod
because if if you have for those of you

439
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,860
who don't know photography few

440
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,980
have a camera should have a camera that
allows the longest possible shorter time

441
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,750
proper time the time the shutters
actually hold open and our

442
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,840
if it's anything over 150 for the half a
second penal

443
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,709
the film latest cumulative it's going to
like build-up shakes and you're gonna

444
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,480
get a blurry pictures or tried hard to
help with that

445
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,130
there's also a lot of other neat things
show later that have to do with a tripod

446
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:27,900
like

447
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,880
take multiple pictures stitch them
together and have a panorama for some

448
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,870
places are just like

449
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,500
breathtaking there's an abandoned train
station in Buffalo

that's on the proportion of Grand
Central Station and its

451
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,670
it's that you go in there and you're
like in or and just

452

have some trickery liked

453
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,540
use a tripod or a fish-eye lens and Anna

I wanna take this time to show simpson
media that we created and then nom

458
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:13,370
you can ask questions

459
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,840
well he's one that up I'll just talk
briefly about to

460
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,250
wire can explore we found abandoned
bowling alleys

461
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:33,380
abandon auditoriums for these whole
place especially the mental hospitals

462
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,720
you know that patients used to be up on
that stage

463
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,690
we can libraries be found also to

464
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,960
interesting thing library with 50,000
books still sitting at the state paid

465
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,200
course was just sitting there abandoned
unfortunately piled on the floor

466
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I don't know why they did that but
that's a shame also this thing here that

467
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,790
little

468
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,490
six-hour flashlight from Home Depot this
is my baby eclipse

469
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,080
you only have to hold on to it be
climbing things it's really good

470
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,480
its creditors see yet you can also what
offended

471
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,280
anywhere you want it gives a pretty
decent man alive it's not perfect but

472
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:14,280
it's pretty good

473
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:23,620
that's as big as it gets this is just
the music video that was made with some

474
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:30,620
open source music

475
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,180
many buildings had corridors connecting
them so patients could be taken without

476
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:42,180
going outside

477
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,480
jobs

478
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:15,280
shit

479
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:28,860
you

480
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:27,940
thank you

481
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,080
I have another video that I made
last-minute

482
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,080
before this presentation at show some of
our footage of

483
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,490
different things that we have found
inside the buildings like like I said

484
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,429
nobody ever came out try to kill us or
anything about that we found some

485
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:46,429
pretty cute animals

486
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:13,629
this is the building for the top all
mapped over when i sat at a large

487
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,559
this is a bad that we found sunning
actually which I don't think that's

488
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,250
normally do that but it was very allies

489
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,799
I had a bat fly up to me the steam
tunnel into to get rid of it all I did

490
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,289
was make a high-pitched screech

491
00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:30,269
has another couldn't see me but every
time editor eaten thing with fly down

492
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,480
the tunnel another comeback

493
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,100
but we figured out I just wanted to get
past us so we kinda moved out of the way

494
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,860
and we're very quiet that flew by

495
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:43,860
her there's a chipmunk on a windowsill
right there

496
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,720
this there's a whole plant rose wildlife
that lives inside these buildings

497
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,669
because in other not occupied by humans
anymore and I find %uh this is an attack

498
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:07,109
by pigeons that we have pigeons the
worst enemy when you explore

499
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,519
the kinda dive bomb unit they will
attack you too harsh

500
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:17,519
veggie speech

501
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,680
good

502
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,590
she first and

503
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:34,590
is local I make a big thing at this
moment to call with other patients and

504
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,450
Austal sitting in a room

505
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:44,450
each

506
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:52,929
together with a win just most girls such
as

507
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:18,340
the the

508
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,309
hand

509
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:32,309
the

510
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:44,980
this

511
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,230
the

512
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:00,290
go

513
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,920
this is a half hour later she still
talking about it

514
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:08,270
each

515
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,590
home pages clinton's

516
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,070
I Sinha

517
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:24,070
homes

518
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:46,900
there's a program I use to stitch
together things

519
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,950
our pictures taken with the tripod it's
an awesome program it's not free but

520
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,570
its it's worth its cost it's called
PanelView and I'm gonna show

521
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,789
I'll how attorneys to pictures that word
is controlling dove other piece of

522
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:59,510
murals

523
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,360
actually if you look on my website thus
laptop doesn't have it as a whole 360

524
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,490
were turned into a QuickTime movie you
could look around like you're in the

525
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,030
room

526
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,240
and %uh from what I've heard certain
people thought I actually had a camera

527
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,559
inside this abandoned building that was
remote control because

528
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:20,559
they looked at the right time a day one
but I

529
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,490
on how good its gonna shoppers is
loading up with Internet Explorer

530
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:34,610
but this is dis is 1/2

531
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:41,610
and up

532
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:50,070
have a very old slow laptop I was
surprise it was able to do any of this

533
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:57,070
and this is the other half

534
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:02,129
of that picture that on you just seem

535
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:09,130
and together

536
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,649
you could see the top of it is banned
that's because the program works it to

537
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:27,879
fit together nicely

538
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:32,558
you can later on crop that out Photoshop
if you want I didn't hear his own data

539
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,149
show that

540
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:37,520
affect you could see right here is work
split right on the other side of the old

541
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,989
lady you really can't see it

542
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,250
put it together seamlessly over here you
could see where

543
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,809
that's actually winder it's put some
really great around here

544
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:51,429
there it is you can kinda see there were
bumps up in Bobst down

545
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:55,389
but are you could tweak it play with
these flags and you can get it actually

546
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,839
put it together seamlessly

547
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:00,200
and hours gonna tell you our

548
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,250
urban exploring story now urban
explorers always have stories about

549
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,329
things that happen to them when they're
doing this cuz

550
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:10,410
you know where things to happen okay on
this is what I call

551
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,859
affectionately the zombie effects on
accuracy in those like nineteen eighties

552
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,308
or even before night at the Living Dead
movies in

553
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:22,339
Xterra we were in a tunnel we traveled
for about maybe 2-3 hours we knew we

554
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:25,790
didn't have enough flashlight power to
get all the way back to where we were

555
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,040
and we're pretty much exhausted cell
reaction to it incidences

556
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,220
this this the first one now we decided
to pop up and this was actually

557
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,250
in part it was a setup abandoned
buildings that were actually

558
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,770
in a public park but you weren't allowed
to go in the buildings

559
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,240
so what we did is we were under the
times we decide to come up

560
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,240
we find a manhole pop the man hope and
stick your head out

561
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,329
and someone's playing a football game
cell

562
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:54,630
okay we go back am figure okay forget we
look where we are right outside the

563
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,910
park's main office

564
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,480
and guess who's playing the poker game
the park manager his family

565
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,460
said so this is it's maybe around 5-6
night

566
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,210
and we figure we're gonna wait him out
how long can a football game class

567
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,099
really come on

568
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,359
so we wait 7 o'clock 8 o'clock

569
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:14,170
9 o'clock it's now dark and we're like
okay to have to be done now

570
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,809
sorry Papa heads up again not only are
they not done but now they've turned on

571
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,770
a series of spotlight so they can
continue to play in the dark

572
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,530
so it got to the point maybe 930 10
o'clock on all the time it was more like

573
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,089
that it

574
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:29,839
we can take it down here anymore theres
a specialist in grime and dirt

575
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,720
mod its dark he coming out there for so
long

576
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,420
so we should forget were popping up we
we did until

577
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,190
the football game went all the way down
I guess what you'd call on a football

578
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,069
one of the end zones or whatever

579
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:46,640
they were all within the other way we
popped up as quick as we could shut away

580
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,129
just walked away football people turned
around didn't know where we came from

581
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,930
but they certainly didn't find that
we're in a top

582
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,058
now the real zombie effect was were also
on another tunnel

583
00:36:56,059 --> 00:37:00,099
same thing in this public park and we
decide to come up but this was not a

584
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:01,329
manhole this was

585
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:04,750
obviously used to be some German
entrance but it got broken down so there

586
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,510
was a board

587
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,520
in the ground that we close at the
entrance

588
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,190
so he went up egos at the most the board
an older

589
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,490
comes down on us from where the board
was remember filthy

590
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:20,190
and there's no distinctive hola just
like a picnic ground and we come up

591
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:26,079
warning incomes up over the ground the
other ground the head pops up food %uh

592
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:26,930
standard

593
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:31,190
with them you know so we finally be
climb out looking like zombies come into

594
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,960
the grave

595
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,970
filled with dirt we scramble up and
there's a couple walking right there

596
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,790
they're standing

597
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:43,210
%ah outside I brush my shock of look at
them and say

598
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:50,210
be careful as a whole there be as I
slide to cover perfect will take

599
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,349
questions now

600
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:58,230
this is life

601
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,049
I love your videos which are reminiscent
irv The Blair Witch Project psycho

00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,750
and the birds but I can tell I'm

603
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,680
were some beer influences come from I
recommend everybody's attention

604
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,598
about a couple months ago there was a
woman who did our motorcycle based

605
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,569
exploration

606
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:18,920
yes %uh are happening at Yeshiva noble
and key n

607
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,880
yes it may be fake but she won't know
what to see

608
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,940
it's a wonderful work she claims she had
she had pictures if it is a famous

609
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:30,170
how much has changed she had many
pictures there's some doubt about its

610
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,280
complete authenticity.

611
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:38,280
in you can rule for I'm

612
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,720
I don't I wanted to ask have you ever
thought about bringing a

613
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,060
a police scanner anything with you llame
contact with the other I haven't because

614
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,609
usually it's just so easy to not get
caught

615
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:53,200
it's like you know they don't care about
this too much like and I met with some

616
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,510
aspects of hacking like

617
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,230
I really don't hack into computer
systems or or too much hacking

618
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,960
except on my own system which is still
hacking I mean I have my own system all

619
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,040
the time modify it

620
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,790
two things it's not as I do but I don't
do it on other people's

621
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,150
so another I I've heard that the laws
are really strict with that they will

622
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,420
come down on you

623
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,790
depending on how you doing it about what
this if it's an abandoned building

624
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:18,160
they're more concerned with your safety
and as long as you look

625
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,279
intelligent and like you're not trying
to give them a hard time and they don't

626
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,569
see you going in like

627
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:26,270
it's just it's not that hard UK thanks

628
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,049
own another thing up a police scanner
adds a whole nother crime to a

629
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:30,500
committing any crime

630
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,310
are with the use of a police radio as I
think that's against federal law not

631
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,509
sure that's a no call me

632
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,950
I really like the open-source song
what's the name a bit and we're going

633
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,910
down yes I plan on giving credit to that

634
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,220
um I had on the presentation somehow
that side in Macon

635
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,150
arm it was the one I first found the
song it was on this

636
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:55,109
are open music repository run by our
somebody using the GPO model

637
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:58,578
and I'm not sure of that song should
have been on there not they were there

638
00:39:58,579 --> 00:39:59,790
was a sample

639
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,329
it was only peace effort that I've used
that was on there and it was listed in

640
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:04,310
parentheses

641
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:08,109
with as a with a hoe and then it was on

642
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:15,109
coven 13 and the name of the song as
Book of Shadows

643
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,000
right the banter banter sense changes
say the 713

644
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,280
and %ah I'm probably gonna email them
and ask them if that

645
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,240
song supposed to be on that repository
because sense I've did a little more

646
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,900
investigation into it

647
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,359
are when I was preparing this
presentation I started looking for more

648
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,130
information about that band

649
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,530
and I found that they have an album for
sale that you can buy to which he should

650
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,700
do because they're

651
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:44,460
awesome and our you know I'm gonna check
into if they're still open source

652
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,460
okay some small things I find work
possible if you are a couple

653
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,810
and you get caught by the police just
his marriage proposal

654
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,440
always works hi the campaign

655
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,480
a Israel though I mean its general but
she took some old pictures

656
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,460
there have been there are 96 and i've
seen I'm

657
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,660
and Amin have fun and giant what's the
actual small city that

658
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,540
was not pick me up but a pronounce it
buys it's a ban will everything they

659
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,920
just left there are things will then run
out on a project like this

660
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
graveyard the Jewish people in the rat
badge when you went there no

661
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,299
hand we have let clothing while reply

662
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:25,400
there were doubts any marks or anything
we Apple

663
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,790
we had in those meter and flipped out
completely if you want inside out I was

664
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,200
a table inside with the middle to stop
its

665
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,109
the Lee radiated when you go to there's
a city in upstate New York called love

666
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:37,328
canal which

667
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:41,260
was they found toxic stuff giving tumors
to children in the bed the whole town

668
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,109
I'd

669
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:44,779
it's not not on the scale what you're
talking about but if you want to see

670
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:46,270
some like that in New York

671
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:51,160
could

672
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,020
this is one get help but notice the Tri
at least in my area

673
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,660
if you take a decent mountain bike and
just all rail lines

674
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,310
usually in urban areas they keep the
rail bed wide enough that we can drive a

675
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,940
truck down to maintain its a

676
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,609
Michael it down sorry in just take that
down to an industrial area

677
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:11,220
just make sure the rail line to bed the
first on if you stay on the bed

678
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,650
like offer the actual tracks its you can
be like

679
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,359
it aid is a bit nerve-wracking at times
we can be good five feet away from the

680
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:19,660
train nothing will happen you

681
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,520
you're having having a bicycle if you do
get spotted also allay some %uh their

682
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,059
fears tell you no longer as much of a
threat

683
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:29,240
things things that are not a threat is
walking a dog

684
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,700
you I've seen people go to some really
really secure places that I wouldn't

685
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,510
have the guts to go up to

686
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,720
and they walk up with the dog as long as
the dogs taken a piss on the side of the

687
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,200
building nobody cares

688
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,799
but the problem is what do you do with
the dog when you want to continue not to

689
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:44,920
have them walking on broken glass in
everything that would be cruel

690
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,490
so I guess you could use him to the dog
to scope it out and when you want to do

691
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,349
real exploring leave the dog at home

692
00:42:50,349 --> 00:42:57,210
cooker

693
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,040
the main library that when too few to
the book and left

694
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,730
with the am console with the claim them
as robbery

695
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,500
all that they they certainly would argue
you are stealing I mean the building is

696
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,400
abandoned as far as we're concerned

697
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,650
but I mean its nothingness on owned a
perfect I need somebody still leave

698
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:15,630
whether it's the state

699
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,270
or person they're just not maintaining
and not actively in there

700
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:22,290
but of course when they take you to
court and probably not gonna make that

701
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,069
distinction

702
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:26,960
and and it's gonna look bad feel like he
took something from someones house and

703
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,579
I mean if you get burglary at the record
I mean they don't as far as I know what

704
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:33,640
somebody has a background check they
don't like look into the details like

705
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,118
oh he was in an abandoned building and
he took a peek chip is a

706
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,200
as a souvenir are they just see burglary
in the picture you wearing a ski mask

707
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,910
walking into my house with my TV set

708
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:48,140
and up yessir so that is a crime and on
top of that

709
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,598
there's also an ethical issues urban
explorers have a whole setup ethnics

710
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,550
that if you look around the various web
sites

711
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,240
I didn't tell this part because I don't
believe there's a lot of urban explorers

712
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,630
out there that think they're likely
you'll be gone and they have all these

713
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,680
ethics in all that in one of the ethics
is our

714
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,118
you know take only pictures and leave
only footprints and I kind of agree with

715
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,119
that one so there's there's ethical
issues

716
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:14,329
thank you sure lumper's well thank you
very much for this item from going on

717
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:16,040
myself and think it's a great resource

718
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,829
um same I'm wondering what the with the
tips do you have for dealing with being

719
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:21,760
approached by

720
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,810
liked a security guard or a police
officer be very polite

721
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,390
arm you know usually before I go there

722
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,910
I have an excuse for why am their legal
legitimate excuse like I'm cutting

723
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,118
through to go to a park

724
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,839
and and make sure that your story lines
up don't same long cutting through her

725
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:39,910
because one time we were at a site there
was these puncher

726
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:44,890
harlem's they look like but I don't want
to judge them so maybe they weren't

727
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,799
and they were walking up so without
saying we were the police reacted very

728
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,319
shy surly in

729
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,520
we didn't say like freeze police or
anything like that we said hey what are

730
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,579
you guys doing here

731
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:58,349
which is perfectly legal to do to
somebody and your call man we're not

732
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:00,440
looking for any problems which is
cutting through

733
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,150
such a cutting through to go where and
North are over there

734
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:07,809
I was like well what's over there they
like I

735
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:11,970
her out to stop look select have your
story

736
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:15,559
worked out in rehearsal at I'm coming
through to go there what's there the

737
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:18,440
park that's I always go there and I
don't wanna pay to park in there so I

738
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,180
cut pro

739
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,259
and then I can walk in like inhabit
ready on the spot and have the stories

740
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:23,930
check out

741
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,140
that's the best thing to do another
thing to do was become friendly with the

742
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,618
person

743
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:30,530
like a lot of people love to talk about
what they do and if they're working

744
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,849
independents like senator

745
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:35,250
chances are they worked there when it
was open and water them that I ran into

746
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,309
they worked there for forty fifty years
and they have stories that just blow

747
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:40,500
your mind away they're not supposed to
tell them to you but

748
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,040
he said i hey how long did you work your
phone is a car forty years what he wanna

749
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,369
know

750
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:48,200
I just find it so interesting can you
tell me a little and the like of I

751
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,450
remember one time I was here and there
was this patient that used to eat people

752
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,780
and he was locked up in

753
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,200
I had a driver but this is a true story
about to mention the patient's name for

754
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,960
obvious reasons

755
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,940
and I had to drive the sky upstate was
so creepy in this is what he said is

756
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,549
what he did

757
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:05,920
and like the guy starts give me a whole
like to his eyes history of the place

758
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,460
and even forgot he forgot to tell me so
to get lost he just drove away with was

759
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:10,710
a

760
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:14,170
because I call it looks at his watch
after hours ago I gotta go now

761
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,579
good thank you very much for them

762
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:21,720
sure I'm

763
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,000
are only mentions an agent the tide but

764
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,099
military police do take this seriously
and even if it is then in

765
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:32,349
it might still be try not to explore
federal property rights

766
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:36,720
yesterday you it may not be in here in
the obvious that this is what it is but

767
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,299
they will consider it and the the yeah
the only the only military base that

768
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,259
I've explored

769
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:45,869
has been turned into a state park
sentences like a conspiracy theories

770
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,000
behind its camp hero out on Long Island

771
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,290
and I imagine that because it's the
state now even though the federal

772
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:52,270
government has

773
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,829
some munitions dump in the woods like
those mines or something like that so

774
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:57,030
they're a little worried about it

775
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,630
but its under state ownership so they're
a little more hands-off all this

776
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,049
this place was a is on hospital it was a
school one point as

777
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:08,099
huge complex she wasn't yeah it was

778
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:12,400
and I have pictures medium get month
sometime send it to my email

779
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,530
I'll to other to Satan and it wasn't me
here the obvious there is a military

780
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:18,339
base

781
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:22,500
but once considered there is you just
creep up on military bases

782
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:27,630
sleep as but I'm

783
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,290
I this is probably going to be our

784
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,730
may be the last question on the help
