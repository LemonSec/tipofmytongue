1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,600
hardware bus security in it embedded
systems let's welcome dan

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,600
thank you exciting

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,769
often had opposite words used to
describe myself

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,599
but the same time I find a very exciting

5
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:22,429
there was one of the topics when I went
sir gone through the video server

6
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:26,630
previous hope conferences an alarm alloy
I really enjoyed them

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,448
and I always felt like there was just a
little bit of something missing which

8
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:31,749
happens to be my area of interest

9
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:34,750
and that snacking hardware how hardware
works

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,320
really more specifically I find that
hacking

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,539
in a common sense means the figuring out
how stuff works making work better for

12
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:43,879
you

13
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,358
I mean most hacks I've ever seen have
started off with someone it's a man I

14
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,870
really wish this didn't work that way

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,250
and i wanna make it work this other way
these are taken apart and figuring it

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,789
out and then you share with a few people
and it becomes a

17
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,519
a published hack and somewhere along the
way sure some people

18
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,069
misuse them here and there but generally
its

19
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,100
curiosity or just the desire to make
things better

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,670
an answer to that and i want to talk
about this subject as I rarely ever see

21
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,780
much discussion on

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,360
and yet for me I find it equally
interesting in that sir

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,400
kinda delving into the world of hardware
and how do you hack hardware how do you

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,229
know what are some the techniques that
are available

25
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,490
if you're in the mind of security what
can you trust

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,449
am working interests what easily exposed
in a gun into

27
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,990
as opposed to it's quite difficult and
challenging

28
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,100
you know so I want to talk a little bit
about that as well I come out this

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,960
probably from a different angle than
alive yamina

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,740
I program and i right right stuff on
computers

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,840
and I'm really enjoy that because I can
sit in my little world and more

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,700
and and really get going on something
but I always need I really do need

33
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,549
something tangible

34
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,350
as well and I notice that the year I
think the radio guys in

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,490
a lot of the other people zemin people
doing our you know

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,789
on and making what they do more than art
form

37
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:07,750
instead of just engineering in a
practice and that's another thing I

38
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,619
think I really like

39
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,890
about discussing how things work in
hacking and all that is because there is

40
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,610
a

41
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,450
in fact a certain art to it and now you
can learn a lot about

42
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,530
even the design by hacking it to learn
about the artist who created

43
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,709
the the design sometimes I find it quite
interesting

44
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:27,850
so well enough for cover 10 gentles
double me

45
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:31,209
the MEA answer a couple questions I

46
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:35,360
I'd sorta discuss why this topic but I
started to say I came out this from a

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,090
different angle than most to you and
that was

48
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,860
that I worked in industry in a in an
industry that enabled me to be able to

49
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,910
play with hardware

50
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,000
and made a lot of customers who are
designing hardware I got to travel quite

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,599
a lot I was a ended up being a manager

52
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,570
engineers in Europe which is really
quite an opportunity

53
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,040
but at the same time expose me to some
constant principles that you see when

54
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,850
you're

55
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,040
in in the many venues that we discuss
soon as politics in

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,250
how things affect what you're trying to
do in your little world

57
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,100
other people that that make laws or or
try to use these tools

58
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,480
as if they're a blunt instrument when
they're really sometimes finely crafted

59
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,400
things in that's what creates security
problems you know you have managers that

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,549
are trying to save money

61
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,280
our cut corners are they don't quite
understand what it is that they're using

62
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,370
pushing designers and engineers to get
it out meet the deadline

63
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,620
we've got to get this new feature in
that new capability so we can market

64
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,019
you know so we can sell it and and what
you see

65
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,239
is imperfections the creep up in

66
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,780
everything no matter how good the plan
is in the designs

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,549
as long as there's a market there trying
to me sales that you're trying to

68
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:44,170
achieve

69
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,840
and manager that yet this guy scares me
by the way to deal it's just like when a

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,319
mild

71
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,730
managers there and on/off

72
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,560
it bugs you as much as a bug me maybe it
bothers me because he looks like my

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,579
manager Kate

74
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:00,970
I'm trying to get it done American just
back off a little bit I get there

75
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,989
ahead as that guy over my shoulder or
over other people shoulder that I saw so

76
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,049
often than many realize managed just a
lot of weaknesses out there and people

77
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:11,120
think that they can depend on the
hardware

78
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,759
whether they can depend on the software
enough to catch the culprit the terrace

79
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,049
now

80
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:19,668
or whatever it might be but in the end
there's all these underlying

81
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:22,849
false and I feel that one other things
that this

82
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,490
group does very well that sorta activist
mentality is

83
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,630
10 at the faults are too weak everybody
out that there there

84
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,050
and make sure that we're not so heavily
dependent on the things around us

85
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,509
and trusting people to pass laws is if
you can't rush these things

86
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,710
and a and a by educating people there
more able to

87
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,430
to questions make decisions for
themselves so that's the aspect of it

88
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,590
that I really like and that's

89
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,479
another reason why I wanted to jump into
this topic nom

90
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,330
and as having come from that perspective
in working with

91
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,099
literally all the major car
manufacturers and gay manufactures and

92
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,960
because the company works for and the
company before that was involved in

93
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,210
microcontrollers and microprocessors in
designs and

94
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,060
in almost every market though that was
certainly their goal and so from the

95
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,580
inside out I saw

96
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,008
people follow this maxim you've heard
this before probably that

97
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:18,940
robert rice the the secretary labor for

98
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,560
Bill Clinton said Anne corporations in
fact have a legal

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
fiduciary responsibility to maximize
their investors return

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,650
okay and in the reality that is there
will your hand at have is corporations

101
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,419
that have

102
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,430
boards running then the don't know
really anything at all about what

103
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,030
they're making

104
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,180
you know their job is to mount a public
company and make the stock go up in

105
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,030
sales go up

106
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,620
and now what they are as a public
company who happens to hire some people

107
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,490
that make a profit

108
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,930
to come out and so if the to in the New
York Times tomorrow want to be something

109
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,430
else

110
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,820
you know they could still do that the
management at all just decide that

111
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,180
you know GE wants to get into
bomb-making or make lenders or whatever

112
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,939
it is that they wanted to be and they
could do that because the managers

113
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:04,719
this big public corporation you to keep
growing alright so

114
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:08,430
why all the way down why am I talking
politics in a class

115
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,550
about by security in hardware security

116
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,909
and the reason is politics and

117
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:19,759
fiduciary responsibilities and deadlines
in these things are what create all

118
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,680
the the security issues that we see and
almost all of them that you

119
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,819
that wheat that will touch on here you
can almost always trace back to

120
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:31,229
that basically that kinda design
mentality pressure

121
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,729
Anna we depend on the hardware industry
a lot on a

122
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,969
security through obscurity the first
layer obscurity is that

123
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,990
not everybody's harbors I'm you know not
everybody can take a little bored look

124
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,319
at it and tell you what the chips are on

125
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,550
maybe hook up a few pros and say oh
that's a nice words the bus

126
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,139
but that's a memory and that kind of
thing but you can get that going to

127
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,360
community college

128
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,449
it's not you don't have to go to
aircraft training

129
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:00,509
main in school right to learn something
to

130
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,919
to create a security risk with that
product with any product

131
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,109
and so obscurity it's only obscure to
the people who don't know

132
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,650
which is often the people making our
laws and people running their companies

133
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,819
and so on

134
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,930
so I figure if we try to educate on all
these levels that's a good thing

135
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,110
what's an embedded system or the easiest
way to describe is to start of

136
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,219
describing something like it but that
isn't in bed in this is one thing you

137
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:24,560
know

138
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,210
really well as of course the computer
system and all the stuff connected to it

139
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,889
I will be labor that point because it's
pretty obvious but you have

140
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,139
some sorta central processing which
might include a

141
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,189
high level math processing if it's a
video card might have really high level

142
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,370
math processing and pipelines that kind
of thing

143
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,389
there's always some input there's always
some output if you don't have any input

144
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:49,949
for instance than the thing is is
working in the dark it has no idea

145
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:52,349
what's going on so another universal

146
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:56,020
constant with all these designs they
have some kind of input

147
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,539
which means you can affect the way they
behave and they all give some sort about

148
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:00,050
put

149
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,990
whatever that might be and that's
another universal if it only accepts

150
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,249
input but doesn't do anything then it
doesn't do anything

151
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:10,069
okay so it has to have some way of
getting there action now

152
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,439
so everything's going input and output
and very often it it communicates with

153
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,889
things which is another

154
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,129
level above just taking information and
like from a keyboard and putting it out

155
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:19,979
like on printers

156
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,710
them the you're gonna load a program
you're gonna cuz it's a hour the world

157
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,650
and I'm gonna describe here's a

158
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,729
his execution of there certainly state
machine logic in a lot of other

159
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,299
analog designs and I mostly talking
about stop the runs on a

160
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,500
on a computer chip microcontroller which
you'd be surprised

161
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,669
this microphone probably has a
microcontroller you know

162
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,360
adjusting compressing the data perhaps
with the suggesting the levels it might

163
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,560
be just controlling the

164
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,260
the pokémon enough for the power switch
my do almost nothing but

165
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,720
I wouldn't be at all surprised opener
things all over this

166
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,950
room especially the thermostats and

167
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,480
lighting ballasts in their lights above
you and

168
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,250
and back down even mention a few more as
we move forward there's a maze

169
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,519
it's tough running code in amazingly
many places all around you

170
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,610
and that's what I'm gonna talk about
then you end up with specialized

171
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,050
peripherals because our most everything
does something special

172
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,660
right and so in the world a design
engineer

173
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,140
designing embedded system when you're
talking about then is trying to get as

174
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,790
much that on one ship as possible

175
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,819
and in fact if you get it all into one
ship

176
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,019
and you can get that ship down to the
smallest possible then you really

177
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,690
achieve the ultimate prize

178
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,470
which is getting your cost down it
especially if you can use

179
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,440
something that that doesn't have to
require a lot of engineering and R&D

180
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,560
you know if you just buying a library of
the aftermarket like mp3

181
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,510
compression or USB bus peripherals you
can get the cost write-downs in up with

182
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,870
things like standard i/o

183
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,480
standard kinds of technology and I'll
explain why this is important

184
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,269
in just a little bit so again you know
coming down this is still fairly easy

185
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,910
stuff

186
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,730
you've got this programmable
microcontroller now with the CPU in it

187
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,050
everything you would have on a computer
in the in the most boiled down s in

188
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,930
service the CPU

189
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,000
my have very few really mundane
instructions

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,040
no like some thirty instructions allow
these systems have

191
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,560
even fewer instructions and that and
might be only a bit stale so really

192
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,850
primitive data types

193
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,300
no details everything's aidid's and you
have to build from there

194
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,130
you know so we end up with people who
are hardware

195
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,640
assembler programmers or low-level C
programmers write

196
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,290
but at some point really the thing just
becomes another software model T

197
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,079
your raincoat it does something there's
a hardware guy that worries about

198
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,490
designing it that's very often a
different person

199
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,230
and so to the coder this is just another

200
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,490
really simple not too powerful computer

201
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,470
that your program the writing code for
the

202
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,699
interesting thing about these things
though is your building them into these

203
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:06,130
these objects around you and you try as
I mentioned to buy the cheapest product

204
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,970
you can if you can buy something off the
shelf media

205
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,069
animals everything off the shelf as
communications for

206
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:15,060
right off the bat there something pipes
date you now

207
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,910
that ship one ship even if the open up
an mp3 player

208
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,779
and has one chip in it there's a good
chance that there's a communications for

209
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,640
am I not even be in use you could tap
into it

210
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,279
and Adam is a partner to and in fact
that got examples of that

211
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,290
you take that embedded system

212
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,319
and then you connected to

213
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,560
to a network you know and there was a
class

214
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,510
earlier on automotive networks where he
would talk about CAN bus and a number of

215
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,339
other buses

216
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,670
but there are so many networks again
depending on what you need is

217
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,779
and I'll even give you some examples 'em
what those are here

218
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:56,569
but here's a basic system you've got an
embedded controller

219
00:11:56,569 --> 00:12:00,399
some kind about but which in this case
is a some seven segment LED

220
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,970
LCD's some sort numeric keypad a little
the square that electrically erasable

221
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,740
memory so that it's something that if
you turn the power off will always be

222
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,730
there but you can change it

223
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,120
some sort of the connection to a network

224
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,000
or a and I'll pour some sort of
communications for

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,140
in very often input from the real world
in this case I'm

226
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,209
I'm driving a motor with the PWM signal
little square signal

227
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,120
and I'm taken some current readings of
that being a back into the system

228
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,269
and I show you this because this is
almost the universal embedded system

229
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:41,390
alright there may not be a motor you
might be playing music but you're still

230
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,439
converting something from a digital
number

231
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,560
there was stored as data somewhere that
you rode perhaps an eastward

232
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,819
and you need to convert that into the
real world or might be a security panel

233
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:55,390
right you punch in a number and you get
a little display

234
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,449
and if you do it right there's little
beach the command a little bit sir

235
00:12:58,449 --> 00:12:59,900
sounds and those ur

236
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,970
created by the little PWM there alright

237
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,720
you might be taking readings maybe you
have an RF card reader on that thing

238
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,130
and so you need an analog input the are
card reads a radio wave

239
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,110
tickets filter down to some sort of
stream you read that in

240
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,189
so are you wit you see here then when I
the reason I

241
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:21,910
kinda dwell on this is it so much and
everything

242
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,130
whether or not it's always that keep a
letter that display

243
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,230
how much memory it has that all changes
of course

244
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,260
but it's amazing just like I said the

245
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,500
the this room is is filled with things
that

246
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,370
that have this unit right now

247
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:43,930
a.m. before AM before anyone actually
just give a quick

248
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,160
introductions to wireless to the buses
that I did

249
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,829
I mention that you're trying to cut
costs right the bosses get this

250
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:55,309
we in this to starship being the
competitor added this new feature the

251
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:57,719
printer can now connect over the
Internet

252
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,029
and and we need to add that feature and
so you go out you buy a standard

253
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:06,579
processor with this new peripheral I
know that you need in

254
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:09,800
and you're right you try to put your
program that you've always had over to

255
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,899
this new thing

256
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:15,410
incorporate this new feature it's got a
bigger LCD display it's got more keys it

257
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,430
talks over

258
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,939
anything airport or maybe a plugs and
USB add that functionality as little as

259
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:22,110
you can

260
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,750
to get their functionality added as ours
as more time in engineers

261
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,399
to do the word and then you ship it so
what you find is a lot of devices that

262
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,069
have been designed

263
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:37,579
with the some subset in mind in a just
keep patching and adding

264
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:41,540
getting any trying to get these new
features on and you'd be surprised again

265
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,709
then

266
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:47,480
to this group maybe nine that if you
make it miss behave in a number of ways

267
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,890
that made sense before but doesn't make
sense anymore

268
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,399
the you get operation now to the thing
that was intended in the in the latest

269
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,470
version of this product this that's a
source of a lot of weird

270
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,929
behavior and again I can a contagion but
these buses then

271
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:07,370
where you end up seeing are like SPI
macro wire two very similar buses and i

272
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,089
squared see as well

273
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,279
the serial buses will almost always have
a data line

274
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,360
talk going up and down a clock line talk
going up and down so they look very much

275
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,380
alike you can pick them out almost
immediately

276
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,649
with this Cobra with the little box in
my plugin PC

277
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:26,670
and those often right almost always are
with six used in fact exclusively to

278
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,529
rate to East where

279
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,709
Anna a eastward is very important
because it could be the

280
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,809
you have proximity sensors in a room
like this for intrusion if there's an

281
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,370
alarm

282
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,959
their thresholds and that's saying they
decide whether you're moving on a

283
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,980
okay there's smoke detectors in the room

284
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,480
dis decide what the smoke levels are
those have

285
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,829
calibration values and decide just what
is too much smoke

286
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:55,390
right or what's not in a light levels
for emergency lights

287
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,720
right the the eight air conditioning

288
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,510
might have default settings that it goes
to if something goes wrong

289
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,089
or or if it's a holiday and people
haven't come to mess with it

290
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:09,160
and they might they might go to some
preset condition

291
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,959
so all these beings end up being like I
said all around you

292
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,170
and nasa love them serve an awfully
important function have no security

293
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,490
whatsoever

294
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,850
okay except that most diverse would not
normally known

295
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,220
it would just be obscure to its that
that there was no security on an

296
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,010
emergency

297
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:31,750
lighting system above the door aka not
necessarily that it doesn't mine

298
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,460
and you probably doesn't so these buses

299
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,480
icebergs the RS 232 almost always for
going out to AFDC

300
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,730
and a lot of fairly moderately complex
designs

301
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,830
to highly complex designs will have a at
buried RS 232 port

302
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,100
and the reason is because when I'm
developing I need some way of getting

303
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,390
data how to back down

304
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,380
so I can monitor how the things working
and I almost always end up doing that

305
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,060
through RS 232 it's the easiest thing
news is connect the wires but date in

306
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,120
their outcomes

307
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,770
you don't have the Nano handshaking
really there it's available but you must

308
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,349
never use it

309
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:12,520
when I'm done it works and I tell my
boss okay I need to clean this up not

310
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,119
knowing you know I told you you're late
already we've got to get this out you

311
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,709
know there'll be no cleaning up just if
it doesn't work

312
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,240
yeah weren't so can ship it that's the

313
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,640
the hallmark of the the product problem
in the bugs that we're gonna that we are

314
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,059
fine

315
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,490
so almost always are some in bed at Rs
232 port

316
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,020
in these moderately complex designs can
if it's in an automobile

317
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,860
served on a production environment dali
they're starting to do

318
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,980
this is a digitally addressable lighting
interface so that ballasts and hotels

319
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,450
for instance is a good example can be
controlled electronically so let's say

320
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,050
this room the room over there the a room
can be divided

321
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,750
and so maybe on the latest control
different sections of the room

322
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,660
so they have a bus running around to the
balance in this area right here

323
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,429
your learned over to this which you
think this which actually switches power

324
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:02,179
but it does

325
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:05,200
it sends a data on a bus

326
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,620
this is alright everybody who's been
learned a meter a okay

327
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,919
and these you know sixteen

328
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:16,080
about us know that they've been
addressed and they'll turn

329
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,370
without them or whatever and then if I
need to reconfigure the room I open this

330
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,000
little hatch on the side of the room in
a getting

331
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,250
and I say all right I wanna learn this
quarter already here maybe somebody's

332
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,130
already pre-programmed all these things

333
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,390
major select these pre programs there's
another bus

334
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,000
write some really important functions
lights in a hotel

335
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,660
and programmability and they all look
like this

336
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,150
you know they're using standard buses
and the right there behind a back panel

337
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,990
and old hotel like this is a classic
example all hotels

338
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,400
all hospitals buildings where anywhere

339
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,650
in the Northeast where these old
buildings in have really good

340
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,490
power and lighting conduit run in the
walls an easy access

341
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,650
two junctions and all that CC this to
right on the law

342
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,150
on the outside the wall is drill a hole
through the wall in a those the cable

343
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,210
right you see it everywhere

344
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,030
junction boxes there left open closets
that have been converted over to

345
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,570
you're passionate words and things like
that and so I

346
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,090
kinda what I'm falling back to kiryas
the

347
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:22,780
there's ways to prevent all this these
are the exploits that are available and

348
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,389
and we're going to more deeper now
service but almost a little bit so what

349
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,360
you know

350
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,270
on the other hand you have to practice
the better

351
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,920
me you buy these interfaces and any
other wires be run outside the building

352
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,350
and where's with disappointment for

353
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,500
and you just hope nobody notices but
about you hope also that you take good

354
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
care of your employees

355
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,120
you know and then over No disgruntled
employees leave the company knowing this

356
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,890
stuff and

357
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:53,260
passing as my top pieces of advice if
you want secure years

358
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,000
your building is take good care
employees and

359
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,290
things tend to go a lot better the

360
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,639
so we talked about an embedded system
and what's typically in an embedded

361
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,720
system in a and I'm gonna give some

362
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,210
these are probably obvious examples via

363
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,860
embedded systems and things that get
network have talked about

364
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,880
lighting ballasts are not shown here
there is a year

365
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,710
a smoke detector it's very common for
these two be network now

366
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,830
and I give you some obvious reasons if
you have a fire

367
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,549
and it's a building like this and
there's nobody around to see it on this

368
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:30,039
still a fire despite the little joke
about the

369
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,850
the bear being in the word renders in or
a tree falls in the woods does it make a

370
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,390
noise

371
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,600
yeah there's still a fire there's nobody
there to see it the

372
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,710
it sets of some monitors somewhere and
perhaps a security guard goes and checks

373
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,320
it out

374
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,590
but it's got a set of a monitor someone
gotta set off an alarm summer

375
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,899
maybe it's even gonna trigger something
to decide whether to call the fire

376
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,380
department

377
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,890
so in a big building like this in a
lotta Billings again we really need

378
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,820
better security than

379
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,740
you've got the standard buses love those
buses that I pointed out before it

380
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,380
probably was going to connect this thing

381
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,280
a.m. wires the right on the open

382
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,270
even if you were to you can buy the
thing on the market and take it home

383
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,600
an active it's it's not like you have to
sit here you know

384
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,230
with wires up to the ceiling with the
house that guy doing up on the latter

385
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,600
you know pulling the fire detector apart
you can buy one ticket home in

386
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,170
and tear it apart figured out and so

387
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,610
a.m. there then again very often experts
are learned that way the hard way

388
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,710
and then you find out their muscle on
the whole there was this easy thing that

389
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,130
he just held the button for 29

390
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,640
would go off you know and you might not

391
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,830
ever have tried that because it makes a
heckuva lot of noise first

392
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,510
right and draws a lot of attention but
if you knew that

393
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,400
that the speaker was built too close to
the grill and I had to do was hold a wet

394
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,330
paper towel to it and hold the button to
align

395
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,419
that it didn't make much more than a
squeaking out a right and now you learn

396
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,710
something about the thing that you
bought on the open market

397
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,190
that has created a certain the security
breach so again what's the lesson

398
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,150
learned don't depend too heavily

399
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,360
on things there that ultimately
somewhere on the way they're gonna get

400
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,350
broken and most examples I give your
unfortunately true

401
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,060
so therefore I won't name the company
that that had it these

402
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,460
proximity detectors are the same thing
that's the the one just to the right of

403
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,050
the year

404
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,930
smoke detector where it's a it detects a
change is an infrared levels

405
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,690
and some of them have microprocessors in
them that are actually fairly

406
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,380
sophisticated now they tried it you know
not turn on for Catera

407
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,660
a plant that's phone our something that
day

408
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,760
some intelligence could have said that
you should have a false alarm because

409
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,070
what if you have too many false alarms
then the fire department police

410
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,409
department as wanna come anymore

411
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,010
so you have to have some intelligence
that says don't call the police over

412
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,010
stupid stuff

413
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,290
or my insurance goes up my my security
costs go up and then you start

414
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,980
complaining

415
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,530
you know the manager the building is
complaining to the facilities guys

416
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:03,139
the damn alarm system turns onto easily
and so was the facilities guys gonna do

417
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,230
is gonna make he's gonna turn it down
are is going to make sure that he

418
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,630
doesn't have any false alarms

419
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,960
if these disgruntled him I just complain
in a to other people to recognize that

420
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,300
their weaknesses in the system

421
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,670
am another classic example is

422
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,790
securities to tie where for instance I i
worked in some buildings that had some

423
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,379
really intense security which

424
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,530
you know you gotta show you go by
gardening at every bag inspecting your

425
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,210
initial bats and you gotta go through
reader then you gotta

426
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,040
key to get past a certain door an and
but there's so much security people prop

427
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,740
the doors open

428
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,870
you know and or they cover up

429
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,570
cameras because their girlfriends coming
to visit lunch or whatever you know they

430
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,340
don't appear in a

431
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,790
burger in this place too much decision
be bored all day

432
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,010
so they they learn the tricks so again

433
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,720
serve over intense application security
creates problems too

434
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,530
smoothies one reason developing a good
system so other bet networks a

435
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,470
the card reader which is on the bottom
left on this picture

436
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,250
maybe a little or ask our readers got a
bus connected it probably got eastward

437
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,770
on there

438
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:12,220
there's all kinds of stuff going on
there that's pretty important

439
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,900
and again it's pretty standard stuff
easy to get ahold

440
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,430
11 and what's in there there's a program
in there will if you get the program you

441
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,630
know exactly how it works

442
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,650
if you could a compromise it you could
have a special number or a special card

443
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,820
that you brought to it that it just says
play the last number

444
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,720
you know back in so somebody got in with
the number right and

445
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,900
you've told it when you know when I can
this number play the last number

446
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,670
whatever whatever was good

447
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,110
nah get sent up the bus to the system is
a joke a burn unlock the door

448
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,150
so you can do this compromise

449
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,240
at the system kaback months later in
actually activate

450
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,040
in even if they have video cameras or
something like that the

451
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,270
are they gonna go through 24 7 hours

452
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:01,629
video for months trying to find when
that happened the problem even a

453
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,230
question that something's wrong with the
bell

454
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,080
begin with and if they do open unless
they've been smart about tamper proofing

455
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,379
it

456
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,720
and and preventing

457
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,120
that kinda access the probably not gonna
catch it you know

458
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,710
when we talk about lockpicking in one or
the other panels and that's exactly the

459
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,030
same thing right you can buy la can take
it home

460
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,149
now once you really know how it works
you can go into your merger

461
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,450
moments and and do you need to do and
that's

462
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:30,670
why again you never be really careful in
the security depend on

463
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,400
and what about who's watching your I
love the shirt watch the Watchers

464
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,720
because how many these cameras do you
think you're on buses now

465
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,510
they're transmitting or they're on some
kind of a bus and allow these Harbor

466
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,540
buses have some sort

467
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,720
black box receiver thats only you know

468
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,620
only in this room with this lock door
but it's a standard thing that you can

469
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,080
buy

470
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,770
and pull the cover of the new be pro be
a fine their standard buses in there

471
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,470
and a and everything that you need to
know probably an extra hours 232 port

472
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,430
thrown in and with a little bit have
inside knowledge you've got

473
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:06,270
access to the system without some inside
knowledge probably have your work cut

474
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:06,960
out for you

475
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,080
and they're still a lot that can be done
much I'm gonna talk about a

476
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,919
so everything from the dumbest little
smoke detector which just

477
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,090
has a little chamber that it tries to
detect smokin all the way up to fix

478
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,330
fully computerized security systems rack
mount systems

479
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,250
all these things have all the standard
buses inside the

480
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,340
here's a perfect example of this then

481
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,370
I went right for a security example
because even though

482
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,160
I said manufacturing systems all kinds
of systems are bused

483
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,520
securities where people get you get
people's attention if you want to talk

484
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,230
about something but it's all the same

485
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,970
so don't let this model fool you into
thinking this is the only place where

486
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,230
they

487
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,790
where the breaches they hear you have a
person and they're sitting at a desk

488
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,300
they've got a USB reader you know
they're making a batch

489
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,690
will start from the point to making the
magic a USB rear and

490
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,970
I've got these blanks and I'm gonna
learn the blank to the reader is a right

491
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:04,930
and Gatorade

492
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:08,880
Joe Smith minute got a camera sister
Maura

493
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,880
probably connected to a computer or
answer go ahead take the picture married

494
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,520
up to this number on this can now

495
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,980
and make a batch and I make the little
badge in to give it to you welcome to

496
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,650
the company

497
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:24,170
employee orientations down the hall and
i'm sorry nobody warned you about coming

498
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,220
to work you

499
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,870
I'm sorry better days going back to get
flashback so a

500
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,450
the but thats on some kind of a network

501
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,520
and something else has taxes that table
legitimate

502
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,760
users and so there somewhere some table
iv. users

503
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,420
right when you go in and wave your badge
a punch in your number or whatever to

504
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,790
the super secure areas gotta go look at
this table

505
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:50,139
and so if this group knows really well
they're one of the most obvious place a

506
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,840
compromise

507
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,440
get a number in there by now with the
badges make one with the number again

508
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,470
your number in there

509
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,670
and now you're is can be you don't even
need to know how to pick a lock

510
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,190
nina hartley need to know anything and
so %uh

511
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,370
is that security that you want to depend
upon to protect you know

512
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,990
very chemicals or or

513
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,450
laser systems are a lot of the stuff
that's in hospitals or something like

514
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,750
that well as which protect a mother's
place

515
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,860
you know I know not to make people
paranoid the

516
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,720
but the point is to make people paranoid
enough to know that you just don't

517
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,590
depend on mister

518
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,460
entire if you're staying at a hospital
people still put in a row where the

519
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,380
surgery should be

520
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,430
you know so they don't get the wrong
foot worked on

521
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:34,480
and you should know your doctor isn't he
should know is equipment

522
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,000
you know there should be any last minute
surprises neck anything

523
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,380
or in in a building access the

524
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,630
Funny People tampering with the house
and things like that are to be observed

525
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,460
in

526
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,600
and questioned we have a panel you have
a network to a patch panel were

527
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,170
multiple thou's might come together you
have a solenoid in the door which is

528
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,330
being told to open

529
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,480
and very often in the security systems
you have like a a panel on axis now

530
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,550
that controls the dorsal and then it
what it sends

531
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,840
is a signal that says hey can I open a
he dissented s

532
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,880
with this was entered on my down

533
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,500
this is the car that was waiting for me
can i unlock the door its sins of a

534
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,140
signal

535
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,340
and in back comes the response is yeah
go ahead and lock the door

536
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,110
but how does that because the the door
lock is right there local to the panel

537
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,770
lines of you can get the panel

538
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,770
and you know how it works you can just
tell the panel open the door you don't

539
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,030
even need permission from

540
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,100
from the network and so there's a number
of security breaches that her

541
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,710
based precisely on their on them I'll
and how he finally by

542
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:40,730
quantities panels are you get one as a
sample you

543
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,890
column apenas se I'm doing design and I
need this panel on

544
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,230
you know we're Security Inc and we're
gonna make hundreds of thousands of

545
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,320
these things

546
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,939
and that's a legitimate way of doing
design and so they send you these things

547
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,960
in

548
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,350
and and and people all the time get them
in

549
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,870
and have them in their hands and tear
them apart in you and again you know as

550
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,370
a manufactured this stuff you don't
really want to curtail that because you

551
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,360
want people to use your products

552
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,170
but you just depend upon people use them
wisely

553
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,210
the so I came back to this just to
remind you then that that system was

554
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:12,860
just

555
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,000
an extension this and so that all over
there that network

556
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,230
were all kinds of things that had little
local buses in that could all be

557
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,130
compromised

558
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:26,650
and their behavior modeled and
understood

559
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:31,350
all the way up to this when I just the
by way of example pull that off

560
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,510
the Internet not to suggest that they
have any security from the hope they

561
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,730
don't it's the international fusion

562
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,840
materials irradiation facility and a.m.

563
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,890
again just not not to point out that
they have laws

564
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:48,179
but just pointing out that they have a
lawn and they have all these local buses

565
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,690
around for some reason they

566
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,380
they publish them I love the security on
the Internet and

567
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,929
head but it's not a very detailed one
but it is

568
00:30:57,929 --> 00:31:00,919
because eeee didn't even need this just
to know this was what was going to be

569
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:01,990
there anyway

570
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,220
there's gonna be some sensors to say
that the radiation level is below what

571
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,360
it needs to be here is the laser to I

572
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,929
or as does somebody have access the chin
is the safety shielding not down

573
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:16,620
you know or other contaminants in the
room we gonna run a super hot laser

574
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,160
and these contaminants in the room
they're gonna super he we're going to

575
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,950
have a little explosion if we're

576
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,550
if we don't have the you know johnny is
not much to smoke in here

577
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,860
our or whatever so all the little
sensors

578
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,970
they detect these qualities

579
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,389
and then they have to make decisions and
some others decisions pertain to

580
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:37,289
security and the point I want to make
here is that you begin in

581
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:40,470
see where my love having a smoke
detector

582
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,750
in the air conditioning in the axis down
all that you could justify

583
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:48,519
begin to think a reason why you could
just by looking all together in one hour

584
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,490
you know because to the designers it
appears I know that makes perfect sense

585
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,419
you know the smoke detector can tell me
what the air quality is an item no

586
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,740
summer's coming out by the security
system and all that into the ceiling is

587
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,029
down then there's a little but I think
it's Preston

588
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:06,539
you gonna trust all this data that
you've got over

589
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,570
standard protocol buses using

590
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,408
you know how to the specification means
and then you can make a decision to turn

591
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:18,210
the super powerful piece of equipment
needed to milling machine is a laser

592
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,370
you know maybe it's it's a it's an
airplane or something

593
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,510
but the the point is that you can't
trust

594
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,879
all that somebody still needs to be a
look around and no you know it's worse a

595
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,559
smokin

596
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,899
in a bag I should be in you know before
we turn this thing on

597
00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:34,919
and that is when you start to cut costs
and you begin to

598
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,389
cut corners because everything's going
well we've never had a problem before

599
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:42,809
I've never heard of that happening you
know and now I know everybody here we

600
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:44,940
trust our them we never change your
passwords

601
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,899
the the last guy because there's such a
bureaucratic nightmare to change

602
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:50,850
password you know

603
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,019
sometimes these levels administration
even

604
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:58,190
for here your best security attempts so
the point is

605
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,299
their standard stuff all over and even

606
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:04,559
the systems that are intend to be the
most secure going to have weaknesses

607
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,710
that exist like this I A

608
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,970
but the day is coming and is here
already in fact we're

609
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,350
me iraq a stop progress networking
network networking things together is

610
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,190
really good thing

611
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,510
in a lot of ways things work more
smoothly much more invisibly

612
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,000
you know they make these washers and
dryers now

613
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,190
where you know you put a load in the
wash in the washing machine has to have

614
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,590
a few more sensors have dirty are the
close what color are the colors

615
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,679
kinda fabric today appear to be they are
able to to basically do

616
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,860
kinda spectrum analysis the contents as
the sensors keep getting cheaper

617
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,519
and why not pass that information over
to the dryer so that the dryer works a

618
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,240
little bit better and if you pass that
information over to the dryer

619
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,539
in the dryer doesn't need a sensor so it
makes perfect sense that they be network

620
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:51,610
and

621
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,169
you think well why would I wanna
washer/dryer this network but then what

622
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:58,200
you know and i got all these bones and
cables and so because you don't see that

623
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,490
where you'll see is a lid in a bun you
know

624
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,470
you open the lives to close in close it
and push a button and menacing always

625
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,100
works

626
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,940
and I take in and put it in the dryer to
push a button in hours worked

627
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,050
on these things become possible because
more data and

628
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,889
mora sensitive sensors in better
communications are there but they also

629
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:19,480
of course

630
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,830
open up funny things like your neighbor
just my know more about your washer and

631
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,259
dryer

632
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,540
the needed and if they're connecting

633
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,500
connecting over Na reveling because who
knows where they're going to be in

634
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,619
relationship to each other we want to
make it as easy as easy as possible

635
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:38,129
so I know how these things communicate
via are a

636
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:42,029
which Israel and these products exist in
then and then we won't have to worry

637
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,649
about that

638
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,859
by so much and of course name created a
really hackable

639
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,080
weird environment but carry therefore in
the manufacturing

640
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,600
like I said security medical earning and
you begin to see where the possibilities

641
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,319
towards a

642
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,360
problems exist even be on hacking just
failure you know

643
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,900
one player so PBX is their phone

644
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,190
I'm sure you well know this is not gonna
be a phone anymore

645
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,480
it's a terminal device I mean the moment
you're doing Voice over IP

646
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,890
maybe remaining crypt in the data but
ultimately there is this

647
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:19,390
highly functional embedded system in
your hand or on your desk or in your

648
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,859
pocket or wherever might be

649
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:24,009
with all the same stuff going on and you
can buy it on the open market in

650
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,359
newburgh you can bring it home

651
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,740
and tear it apart and figure out how out
how it works and

652
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,680
and figure out what kind of things can
be done the compromises it can be made

653
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,118
to spy on you or can it be made to

654
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:39,640
to fail when you wanted to work with
through denial of service attacks or

655
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,650
you know the usual mechanisms on the
network side or through some compromise

656
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,290
security on the hardware side somebody
just gets a hold over

657
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,009
figures out kinda phone and no the
somebody wants to but the bus and brings

658
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:51,770
in a different phone

659
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,330
when he's not looking and next thing you
know you've got a

660
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,690
a microphone yes it's that would be a
hazer just exactly like your phone did

661
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:05,170
and thats thats amateur you realize by
reading the papers a lot about people

662
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:05,900
out there

663
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,940
we've somebody voted for summer and
their

664
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,480
in this stuff for is possible as

665
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,950
here a it becomes more possible as a
technology increases

666
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,529
GPS is in your cell phone telling
emergency

667
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:25,080
where you are that's a good thing you
know fire I get hit by a car in the guy

668
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,840
drives off in an hour

669
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,720
a probably be glad that my phone you
know nardone and told everybody

670
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,500
where I was but at the same time if I
happen to come to a hacker conference to

671
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,430
present

672
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,040
on a topic that maybe people don't like
I wouldn't really want to

673
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,420
people think that was something wrong
and I say that that would happen but as

674
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,859
the time

675
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:47,619
byron the starsky created when people
don't understand that this is just

676
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:51,590
common knowledge in some circles like
the designers at this time and not in

677
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,090
others

678
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,640
and so again kinda being the drama with
the messages

679
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,910
is about just which is educating people
the

680
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,339
building maintenance building management
talked about

681
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,240
security and and fire systems and

682
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,330
building access and ventilation systems
and

683
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:14,340
we have a large building like that like
this you have water systems ray you have

684
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,190
building wide

685
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,770
sensor networks that have to be able to
manage what their

686
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,780
I mean how much hot water do you need in
in is the laundry

687
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,640
being cranked up for such a big a
facility is this is there's teenies be

688
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,480
vented whatever

689
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,700
you know which way to the HVAC doors
need to route the a hot air

690
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,100
they were tryna conserves and the
neighbor China vented to the outside

691
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,259
so a these circuit air circulation and
all kinds of things

692
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,609
get control from the central systems and
you don't necessarily have to hack the

693
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:46,640
central system

694
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,930
these things are so dependent on data
coming to them

695
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,399
and so on and the decisions they make
your absolute if the

696
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,410
sensor says this then I turn on the fan

697
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,990
it says that I turn off the fan i turn
it down and

698
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,250
and so you don't necessarily always have
to hack the computer that's in the year

699
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,890
the security desk Nordic be able to
cause problems

700
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:11,040
a manufacturing flaw Roscoes I mention

701
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,279
mining and industrial you know train
systems

702
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,410
everything you can think that day has to
have a certain amount of control

703
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,490
you think oh they training you think oh
there's only a computer

704
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:26,770
running the the train but there's not
there's there's a little microcontroller

705
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,320
controlling the motors at the door and
and then they may be read the back EMF

706
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,050
that the

707
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,690
that gets creative somebody's in the
door and then reverses the door

708
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,990
and there was a threshold to determine
whether or not there was somebody there

709
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,070
and somebody had a program that in
imagine that giving tree

710
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,650
you know or change or something like
that a.m.

711
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,740
so again you have to have emergency
exits you have to have a way that a

712
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,850
person is allowed to open a door

713
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:54,170
right and so if it were where where am I
bring this full circle is

714
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:57,370
were 10 viewers somebody who listen to
this to be in a meeting where so many

715
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:01,000
would argue now the computer will work
there will be an emergency door that

716
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,130
unlocks if there's ever an emergency

717
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:07,470
some unease with the foot down and say
no you know there has to be a manual way

718
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,359
opening emergency period because I know
that it's not possible

719
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,069
down convince needed the system it will
always be perfect

720
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:20,310
and if you can speak intelligently about
why that is your convince more people

721
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:25,270
you make a bigger difference so system
bus weakness and then I'm gonna move on

722
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,180
to the

723
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,450
the controller the central controller

724
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:35,950
the system bus weaknesses as I mentioned
the very often standard buses

725
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:40,380
and them there it's easy to reveal what
data and commands and so are crossing

726
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,870
them

727
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,200
a you can do about the show for tools

728
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,670
in fact it's one of the reasons why this
topic is so dreamy in right now

729
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,960
to me it's become something them become
a bit more excited about because

730
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,140
I used to be that even for for me

731
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,319
to convince my company to buy me a multi
thousand-dollar

732
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,890
bus analyzer you know ten to twenty
thousand dollar bus analyzer

733
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,259
will be a little bit hard for me to pull
off and that's a level evokes

734
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,020
obscurity the after respect you know not
everybody is willing to spend that kind

735
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,420
of money that narrows the

736
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,380
number people down quite a lot but
nowadays penny in PCs are so fast

737
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,200
and heck you can run a Linux cluster get
some really

738
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,230
good cranking power gone there and

739
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,600
and as well embedded systems have become
so fast

740
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,130
that now you can buy is just a little
box with a few wires coming out with the

741
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,859
samples the inputs

742
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:36,299
and has a high-speed connection to the
computer

743
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,380
free apps and software and you've got a
bus analyzer so for a hundred bucks or

744
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,650
200 bucks

745
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,650
mean you have something that five or ten
years ago was a ten or twenty thousand

746
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,460
dollar piece of equipment

747
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,110
alright so now it separates the

748
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,080
than those in the know from those that
are obscured

749
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,730
from knowing it well a couple hundred
bucks and the

750
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:00,860
no little class at the Community College
really you know a few classes at the

751
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,760
Community College

752
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,110
in know your back to hacking again and
so the days

753
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,210
the having the rocket scientist you know
to build

754
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,090
to to break into hardware there they
never existed

755
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,260
of course because all the bugs in the
deadlines and then we talked about

756
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,820
but actually even understanding not is
not that hard anymore

757
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,980
and actually examining in revealing
what's going on inside is

758
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,300
even easier all you need are the usual
conserves

759
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,330
the you have already in

760
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:32,730
in terms of packing and perhaps that
bridge

761
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,930
maybe this is it or maybe it's the class
or whatever that bridge

762
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,020
to to doing in your into here in our
tracking

763
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,410
it's that easy and as I said really
ninety-nine percent

764
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,759
the iraqis just to make things better
for the user know something summer

765
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,000
doesn't work the way you want it to you
in so you develop the skills that way

766
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,120
and sooner or later they're their widely
available

767
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,200
Analytics is a malcontent that knows how
to use a crowbar

768
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,130
to pop open a door and you've got it and
so is the technology is there

769
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,010
is the first the developed the
technology other criminal well if that

770
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,120
were the case crowbars and hammers you
know because

771
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,700
how good is a car alarm system need to
be braided bust the window

772
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,250
region and steal a purse if that's what
you're after begin

773
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,390
worry Tollway the car it's that nice a
car mean yeah that's pretty severe

774
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,140
towing a car I mean how long does it
take to pull a car onto a trailer

775
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,730
drive off with it you know if you ask a
professional five minutes

776
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,470
they can be out there with a car and how
often have you seen a car pulled up on a

777
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,300
tow truck and

778
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,620
thought nothing of it and so how good is
the security system need to be only as

779
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,150
good

780
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,100
really or a little better as the next
obviously resolving your still kinda

781
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,910
left yourself

782
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:45,980
to solve the problem anyway and so
attacker mentality hacker

783
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,690
knowledge

784
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:52,680
and yes it with him everything certainly
seems easier sometimes you need some

785
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,390
high-level knowledge because their
protocols you so if they're using TCP IP

786
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:00,089
the are they using some are tires and so
there's backs going back and forth over

787
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:03,520
the network there might be headers and
they might be built their numbers in

788
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,930
they might even the encrypting you know
you might feel at that level 0

789
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,810
attack is hopeless and if it's a secure
system hopefully it is

790
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:16,470
but examples a then just bus analysis

791
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:22,800
an oscilloscope with the storage you can
buy them now for about 2500 bucks

792
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,350
though on the bottom right is the
example in that I gave

793
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:31,360
with the here's just a little piece of
hardware connected to a computer

794
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,070
and this then is on the computer screen
alright so all those signals the earlier

795
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,410
this like a ten thousand dollar

796
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,000
the Civic women these are all five in
10,000 other Pacific women

797
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,350
here's a little piece of hardware and
doing the same thing doing on your

798
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,500
computer you back to the world

799
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,070
love ones and zeros and and in looking
for patterns

800
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:54,280
and weaknesses and trying to replicate
things that you've seen over here

801
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,760
back over there and see if you can
affect the behavior and and I'm going to

802
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,900
infect discuss some other

803
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:04,510
and in like a set the bridge gets a
created the gap is crossed and

804
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:08,110
now everybody has access to its own
hours obscurity it's gone

805
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,120
on okay so

806
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,220
for you you've got this system if you
really intent

807
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,730
on breaking it somebody might argue well
you know you can encrypt the data

808
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,720
you can encrypt the buses that that's
that's probably good enough and if you

809
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,000
start to hear the words

810
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,670
then than you might think the really you
really gotta security is like to take

811
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,109
care

812
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:35,078
very things interrupted %uh not true at
all there's just another level about

813
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,539
this cation obscurity that you have to
get through

814
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:40,950
but the real deal is still there to be
had nom

815
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,230
and thats get the source code well
there's a

816
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:48,470
how do you get the source code is
something that's a chip well

817
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:52,130
in similar ways that you might get to it
in a a computer your computer

818
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,720
a real hardware way of doing it rather
than having a software to recover

819
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,359
like having a processor emulator running
that then ran a piece of software that

820
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,279
you can halt and examine the software

821
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:06,519
a real hardware way of doing it would be
to take the board immobilize the

822
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:11,589
the processor that's running keep the
RAM repress the deer and disaster there

823
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:15,819
you heard otherwise talk earlier about
his board needed the RAM

824
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:19,630
because it was able to use your chip so
that's the standard still today for a

825
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,309
lot a memory

826
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:25,960
so you keep the deer and refreshed with
another little circuit an orifice søren

827
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,750
you don't have to worry about it now you
two starts cooling out the

828
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,950
the contents of all the memory you can
access whatever was on the hard drive in

829
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:33,240
need

830
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,579
the down and you've got the executed and
if there was any encryption algorithms

831
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:38,180
there in there

832
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:42,990
you know and so if you can disassemble
now you can read the encryption robbery

833
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,480
you know

834
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,259
you wanna know how the encryption work
you gotta there's the blueprint right

835
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:47,869
there for you

836
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:51,779
it's not very often done that way
because there's easier ways the brute

837
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:53,579
force methods in semi intelligent

838
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,829
you saw the the perhaps the lockpicking
where they found a way to get into the

839
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:01,089
Masters a reading cracked every possible
combination

840
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:04,730
by knowing a little bit about the system
they narrowed it down significantly

841
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:10,000
and this this dan is the same thing now
embedded systems though

842
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,869
do have the tricky problem I love the
memory is on the chip and so how do you

843
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:17,359
get that memory at the chip at the chip
doesn't want you to have it

844
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,490
and that presents a a bit more of a
problem to crack

845
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,880
there are some amazingly some very

846
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,829
easy ways to do that and then there's
some rather sophisticated ways

847
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:32,400
for this is a from a paper

848
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,410
in written by sergei

849
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:39,259
and he in his paper he discusses

850
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:42,349
the methods then for a cracking hardware
for cracking a controller

851
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:47,259
sex getting a program this is how we're
gonna attack it and they are identical

852
00:46:47,259 --> 00:46:50,779
to every method that you that you
understand about hacking

853
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:54,160
we're gonna use micro probing techniques

854
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,950
alright we're gonna a in other words
we're at where

855
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,680
we're going to look at exactly what it
does you know we're examining

856
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,930
what seems to go in at work seems to
come out a bit we can use a

857
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:10,098
an attack of some kind right upset the
thing and and create an environment

858
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:14,859
that it wasn't program for week we can
just snoopy for long periods of time

859
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:16,348
eavesdrop on the thing

860
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:19,900
and see if you can glean at least some
information right that lockpicking

861
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,759
analogy

862
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:24,559
where he said once you had a key that
word you can work your way to the master

863
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,799
key that really touched

864
00:47:25,799 --> 00:47:30,390
to the core of what we're talking about
here because this might not crack it

865
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,440
that minor

866
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,849
bracket but the combined efforts what
you learn about well this is a nice word

867
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:36,609
c-bus

868
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:40,450
and there's data being put in the square
I noticed the data gets put to the east

869
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:41,380
where every time I do

870
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,559
this you know I say store the

871
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,119
phone number or whenever a hold the
button too long on the year

872
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:51,960
on the smoke detector write all this and
there's this little flurry of activity

873
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,720
on the square

874
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,000
any begin to recognize this maybe
there's a printer cartridge

875
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,519
right there that now printers are so
cheap because brick arches

876
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,089
so expensive the wire the printer
cartridges so expensive only one reason

877
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,038
because they can be

878
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:08,920
right there in cryptid you can they're
hard to crack and so now you're forced

879
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,140
to buy these half-empty

880
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:14,420
printer cartridges for 40 and 50 bucks
each because they're hard to crack

881
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,579
that's the only reason and not because
prayer card to discuss that much

882
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:21,750
but you can buy printer cartridge and
take it home and you can figure out

883
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:23,289
what's in it and how it works

884
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:26,319
other printer cartridge companies do
this very legitimate the reverse

885
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,308
engineer the

886
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:31,420
Canon bubble jet printer cartridge and
figure out how it works and they do that

887
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,910
in part for instance by examining the
standard bus

888
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,500
inside it's got this funny thing it does
with the printer

889
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,589
that we can figure out but we found that
a race to the C squared

890
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:45,380
and what rights the sport is how much
Inc is left

891
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,450
you know well if you just change that
value every now and then it's for

892
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,250
you can keep filling that's a workaround
happened and now that you begin to

893
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,880
understand more about how it works

894
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,680
you may be affected a little bit you
could even implement its functionality

895
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:57,930
in

896
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:02,058
and tricked the printer into thinking
you have a legitimate in cartridge in

897
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:05,529
alright so these eavesdropping and

898
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:08,579
and of course the where my favorites is
a fault generation

899
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:12,589
re just throw everything at it see what
goes wrong seeing what does ron is one

900
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:13,970
of the finest ways to

901
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:17,739
to find out how something works so

902
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:21,329
and you can even relate that to social
engineering

903
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:24,960
right are not only just computers you're
sorta the

904
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,339
some hang around and see how things were

905
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:31,519
maybe you try to get in after a couple
other

906
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,720
frontal assault attacks maybe just hang
around and watch how other people

907
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,489
getting out

908
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:40,140
learn about what's going on or you
create problems right

909
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,779
false alarms are people dropping books
or whatever and I'll send the security

910
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:45,430
card

911
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,919
cars get all busy in the doors have
opened in your right so

912
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,220
even these kinds of techniques these are
the four things they almost always see

913
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:58,089
everybody use as the method for figuring
out how something works

914
00:49:58,089 --> 00:50:02,269
and specifically then cracking
microcontrollers because these things

915
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:03,430
are and everything

916
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,569
my phone as I said the microphone

917
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:09,980
the HVAC panel and they're amazingly

918
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:14,279
a prolific and and quite easy really
fairly easy crack while autumn

919
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:18,079
and this guy is written a paper on how
to do it and he depends upon certain

920
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,349
laws of physics

921
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:23,130
one of them is having to do transistors
transistors have altered levels that

922
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:25,430
they operate correctly a

923
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,239
if you get down below their voters level
they don't behave like they're supposed

924
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:28,839
to

925
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:33,130
and if you can make them behave like
they're not supposed to enough times

926
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,489
you might be able to make the whole
circuit behave like it's not supposed to

927
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:40,119
and so crack number one is messed with
the power supply

928
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,250
to start putting noise on the power
supply

929
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:48,009
making the power supply air jump up and
down putting noise in Armenia

930
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:51,819
and the data lines and see what happens
like i said im ice in the CS

931
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:55,380
for UHV activity a burst of activity
that you never seen before

932
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,430
and so you narrow down the noise in New
finally figure out there

933
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,750
this happening here that having their
causes this to happen you learn you

934
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,359
they call it the technique
fingerprinting in some cases

935
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:10,660
resorted to taking a little electronic
fingerprint how it behaves with certain

936
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,839
inputs

937
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,430
well he does this with this little box
he's got all these wires that lead to

938
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,640
every lead on the a microcontroller

939
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,078
taking control the signals to everywhere
and he's got a battery uva/uvb tricks

940
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:22,880
that he's learned

941
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,220
begins to work and with that

942
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,360
he's cracked all these microcontrollers
okay

943
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,480
the whether reasons why don't need to go
into a lot of detail exactly on how to

944
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,710
do this is because

945
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:41,450
it's a science in another self reverse
engineering somebody else's product is

946
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,200
something that

947
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,500
many many very large companies do and in
fact the

948
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,570
legally reasonably if you lost the
source code to your own

949
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:52,090
product the absolutely need a way to get
a copy of it

950
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:55,230
is it illegal for you to get a copy have
your own source code

951
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,850
so if you hire company capable of doing
this

952
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,509
for the perfectly legitimate reason im
cracking your source code back I love it

953
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,100
why I could

954
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,160
you could be arrested so therefore the
tools are legitimate and that sounds

955
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,850
like a sneaky way around the fact is
there's a lot of that that's very

956
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,890
important aspect

957
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:14,900
the reverse engineering and design are
the tools that it takes to be able to do

958
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,550
this training noise on pins

959
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,490
gonna sit there is legislation created
you could design a circuit that did that

960
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:21,730
almost nothing could be me

961
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:25,110
you know well you're not allowed to
build something they can with all the

962
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,220
inputs on pins

963
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,100
you know well then throw it out is
really where go back to the dark ages

964
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,300
now and so

965
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,080
for his where you can just search on

966
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,509
actually on sergei big

967
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:45,010
the name that I mentioned in the
previous slide on his paper

968
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:48,430
its score bogota

969
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:53,690
I know I have a haven't done justice to
it and I actually had early

970
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:58,540
WWW dot C L .ca am dot a C dot UK

971
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,170
you probably pulling this off the online
version if you do anything with this

972
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:07,020
as last till the SPS 32 slash MC you
underscore Loughner

973
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,920
dot HTML I know you didn't get that in
this

974
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,160
so sergei wrote a paper on it

975
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,118
and it's a actually is subject to
research breaking microcontrollers a

976
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,080
princeton university

977
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,650
the and MIT you know these companies
these

978
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,359
universities are trying to develop
better technologies and so of course

979
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:28,240
they're showing how these can be broken

980
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,920
so they can demonstrate a better way of
doing it and therefore this becomes a

981
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,980
necessary means a

982
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,460
research so like I said there's a lot I
really legitimate reasons to be able to

983
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,119
do this

984
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,970
is not a reason to be afraid of people
are doing this

985
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:44,680
just need to be aware that this can be
done and so

986
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,330
another reason why hardware is not also
all that security you know

987
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:53,410
the tools available to to get into your
just prolific a

988
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:56,740
there are some more sophisticated
techniques though and this you begin to

989
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,920
see when

990
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,100
industries attack each other you know
corporations start to really do battle

991
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,990
maybe something very popular comes out
like the PlayStation 2

992
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:09,980
in maybe they've got this what they call
a Magic Memory gate

993
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,510
medicaid memory cards the plugin anybody
who

994
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:19,790
on the PlayStation to knows that you
have to buy the Sony memory cartridge

995
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:24,630
and they're really expensive in fact the
amazingly so

996
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:28,859
compared to the same amount a memory on
anything else standard memory for a

997
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:29,420
camera

998
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,850
our free mp3 player and when you just
love to pay the room the real prize

999
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:37,299
now that is a memory and there's nothing
illegal about buying a p

1000
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,630
he's a memory that works in there this
is very difficult to make one that will

1001
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:43,130
work because they've been cryptid

1002
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:47,050
the data going back and forth with this
magic a system

1003
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,390
and so now you have companies whose
industries dependent upon reverse

1004
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,160
engineering that

1005
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,210
okay and so they spent a lot of money
with these kinda techniques you can do

1006
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:59,660
power consumption hours you can probe
the chip you can examine

1007
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,020
with infrared microscopes and look at
the traces inside the chip

1008
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:08,500
the light coming on for the the active
traces just like buses and signals on a

1009
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,390
a circus boi

1010
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:12,710
here's a what's called a fair ever

1011
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:16,780
focused ion beam we can actually rewrite
the circuit you can cut traces on a

1012
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,440
circuit

1013
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,450
you can do it redraw where the trees on
a circuit

1014
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:25,300
in rewire an integrated circuit that

1015
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,190
you can build i sees with that you can
actually and doped materials and

1016
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:32,430
create transistors in they're actually
very sophisticated

1017
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:36,070
companies wary if you're a semiconductor
manufacturing you've screwed up and you

1018
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:39,820
need to find out with this fix it you
can come up with a fix

1019
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,370
send it off to a company to have it
there but they will build the

1020
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,180
transistors right on your die

1021
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,420
to at this little change make a make it
to raise in send you the dive back into

1022
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:48,859
you can

1023
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:52,270
you can see if you fix will work as can
a person

1024
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,720
company or entity trying to reverse
engineer I see if they wanna break or

1025
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,590
protect

1026
00:55:56,590 --> 00:56:00,520
anything maybe this line breaks maybe
this line breaks alright so then once

1027
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,490
you learn these techniques they figured
out the

1028
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:06,700
the reverse engineer the product

1029
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:12,200
I'll if if you how expensive is it to do
that was the question

1030
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,550
a if their companies in China that

1031
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:19,380
the the reverse engineer so they can
manufacture the clone for

1032
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,520
you know so you might if you can make
enough get it for free

1033
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:27,480
I am I've I'm at a time it looks like
some skin is a wonder to last things

1034
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,070
now the power supply analysis was just
so you can look at the power going into

1035
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:31,550
it

1036
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,609
and you can see which instructions are
often being executed by how much power

1037
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:36,680
they drop

1038
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,990
address changes go to use that is calls
changed a lot of

1039
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:44,410
last circuitry and rather more power
then just really simple

1040
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:48,170
and add or subtract or something like
that she can actually examine the power

1041
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:49,460
consumption of a chip

1042
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:52,740
and figure out what kinda decryption
routine it might be using

1043
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,790
because you see that is looping or
that's just to terminate it always looks

1044
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:56,700
like noise

1045
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,080
where has the repetitious cycles threw
that in there because a

1046
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:05,210
I was at the Museum of American History
in Mad Magazine has this

1047
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:10,790
cover from the 70's I think it was 78
now in AF started forcing UPC symbols

1048
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:14,859
onto products and they they put this one
at that says we hope this issue jams

1049
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:16,819
every computer in the country

1050
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:21,060
handed that kinda over thing that could
actually work if you had sort of an

1051
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,040
inside knowledge

1052
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,600
that that was pretty clever them to make
the process in our way

1053
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,260
and the rest is just pointing out that
these hack how these hacks are being

1054
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:28,950
done

1055
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:32,330
cut some traces insert a circuit board

1056
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:36,700
the they are OnStar system has been
hacked

1057
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,150
you can use the GPS in it with your
computer you can use the computer system

1058
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:44,090
with your GPS you can add a serial port

1059
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:48,630
because there's an embedded Serial Port
to it and some things that we might try

1060
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:49,680
to do too

1061
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:55,500
to improve it security tamper-proof
being encryption authentication and all

1062
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:56,520
these things

1063
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,810
but the best one is a the last one here
don't depend too

1064
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,880
too much on hardware for ultimate
security you're just not going to

1065
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,170
achieve

1066
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:07,210
a final resolution if that's your
mechanism

1067
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,309
the near future and

1068
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:13,140
embedded in if they're I wanted to let
you guys know I know you probably fully

1069
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,348
aware that but the manufactures
microcontrollers

1070
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:18,589
are really gearing up with chips
internet with Ethernet

1071
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:22,460
Mac bison so the physical and the Mac
lehrer

1072
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:26,760
are built into the chip and everybody's
coming out it's a and that precedes a

1073
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,280
flutter design which gonna proceed a
flower products

1074
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,960
and so you're going to see a lotto
really hackable

1075
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,460
products coming out soon and you're a

1076
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,750
your your voice over IP phone may be one
of them how does the

1077
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:43,190
the the legal issues affect us in this
industry

1078
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,920
the DMCA can make it illegal in some
cases to reverse engineer

1079
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,369
there are limits on encryption explore
and I see complexity explore

1080
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:55,000
and a couple of things that bothered me
that the new radio project has to worry

1081
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,270
about things like HD TV because they're
able to build a universal circuit

1082
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:02,829
they can bring in almost any frequency
they could theoretically bring in HD TV

1083
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:07,069
which we can allow because somebody owns
that and

1084
00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:10,569
they're supposed to charging money for
being able to to the crib that

1085
00:59:10,569 --> 00:59:13,900
and just being able to build your own
description that wouldn't or a disk

1086
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,930
rather would be right

1087
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:18,099
but even though that's not its expressed
intention

1088
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:21,319
my out their oaths drive in my laptop

1089
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:24,730
I can get the Linux the source code for
the next driver because

1090
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:28,910
its capable in Sapporo being having its
frequency change throughout the 2.4

1091
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:29,710
gigahertz ban

1092
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:33,430
and so I could theoretically nefarious
Lee use their

1093
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:37,000
if I could get the source code and
change the way it worked forgetting the

1094
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,990
fact I can build a ser

1095
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,250
to do that need you know

1096
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,380
an extrovert at their house to do that
but still they've had problems being

1097
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,119
able to release the source code because
people who don't understand

1098
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:51,800
get in the way of the progress the real
progress FCC limitations on frequencies

1099
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:56,780
narrow down the range where you'll find
bus is connected and then finally

1100
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,970
go forth these happiness hope
everybody's having a good time

1101
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:04,869
I had a really great time hopefully use
the information for good

1102
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:09,829
that's what I would ask and I don't know
accept invitations to crack anybody

1103
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:10,380
system

1104
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:13,380
but you're welcome the right to mir or
give me a call

1105
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,630
%ah
