25
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,900
hello okay iowa-based or gonna do
tonight is

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,430
we'll talk a little bit ourselves we
have a whole bunch a special guests

27
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,400
I will be popping up across a bright
lights on me so I can see anything so

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,440
out the people out there managing the
special guests come up

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,769
ok and I sunglasses I really can see

30
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,500
just the

31
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,310
lead them up and I will will put them on
and we'll take questions from the

32
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,860
audience

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,140
I don't think we could take questions on
the phone tonight because

34
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,350
well we have limited intelligence is I
so much we can do it once sorry just the

35
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,000
way it goes

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,750
on this service is kinda momentous
occasion for us

37
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,709
because so many things have happened at
once this is the 20th anniversary of

38
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,640
2600 magazine if you believe that

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,640
the

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,710
and art a if when we started this thing
back in 1984 by sneaking into offices

41
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,040
later

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,220
90 exit visa papers we get sent about 20
people

43
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,570
IOC if I ever thought at that time is
going to get to the stage where we were

44
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,060
seen on newsstands in

45
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,120
on the radio and having conferences I
never ever would have believed it

46
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,210
I but here we are and it's %uh the 10th
anniversary of our first conference

47
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,290
which was called hackers on planet Earth
back in 1994 in this very space

48
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,209
are coming if you were here for that how
good number

49
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:29,210
good number rest you can clap go ahead
so yeah it's a milestone as far as that

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,450
goes

51
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,100
and then of course I'm yesterday
actually today

52
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,790
officially the freedom downtime DVD
finally was released

53
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,790
so that's the how many years after this
film

54
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,930
are well he was filmed at the actual
footage was taken in 1998

55
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,970
and yes yes but they made Star Wars last
time I realize that I

56
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,670
we had we had time to edit the thing and
of course we get some more shooting me

57
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,140
where to ken was at a prison

58
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,540
are but the DVD we've actually added a
whole lot of features and a new

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,799
languages and things like that I

60
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,580
actually poor chap maybe you can I i
address the whole editing process that

61
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,730
sure took a long time dinner

62
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,770
rustic very long time on it's amazing
from

63
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,799
we had a huge machine at the time at the
time we head

64
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,270
I think it was a 100 gigabytes RAID
array

65
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,330
and another 100 gigabytes non RAID
storage in

66
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,380
and a really fast 333 megahertz

67
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,409
mcintosh running like Ellis sale

68
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,870
we just got from 7-8 or something like
that is one on the upgrades

69
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,610
g3 was really nice it was a very nice
machine it was the biggest machine I'd

70
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,240
ever used in my life and now I have a1
terabyte array a

71
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,250
I'll but we're not editing movies you
know that's the thing we're editing

72
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,250
movies on these

73
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,380
his equipment that at the time were
state-of-the-art

74
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,520
when we made the movie we didn't know
how you can edit it because we certainly

75
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,890
couldn't afford the the professional
editing systems we could even afford to

76
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,620
rent them

77
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,290
so we had no idea and and in this
program called it a TV came along

78
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,550
and we sure learned a lot about that
program its

79
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,120
and its limitations it was good and it
was bad at the same time was good that

80
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,140
we got our stuff done it was bad that it
had bugs at every turn

81
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,909
it gave us hope and took it away
important thing is we got through it and

82
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,430
I'm

83
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,470
finished and hopefully it all works so
enjoy

84
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,290
if you if you get a copy on so there's
that milestone and of course just having

85
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:35,290
kevin Mitnick here for the first time
ever

86
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,240
let me tell you the story 1994

87
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,349
at the first conference at the hotel
Pennsylvania kevin was on the run

88
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,659
he was he was being pursued by the FBI
in all kinds law enforcement agencies

89
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,000
for violating his probation

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,379
and he might go back to present him I go
back to the eight-month solitary type

91
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:54,930
thing

92
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,569
so he was living a double life and and
having somebody else's name I think in

93
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:00,919
North Carolina at that point

94
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,609
and he would call occasionally while we
were having our first conference he

95
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,349
would call us

96
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:09,099
on the on the wall phones up the the
hotel not

97
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,639
and how he transforms into the water as
needed and then you ask how the

98
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,909
conference is going by really wish I
could be there too bad I'm not there you

99
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:16,219
know

100
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:19,379
by the fight showed up a course that
arrest me on the spot Emanuel

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,400
yes you may recall that we we had a lot
of people wearing kevin Mitnick masks

102
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,870
and our first her conference here 94 you
make those misguided

103
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,000
they were actually a Kevin I apology

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,699
story I had to take that picture view
from the New York Times and

105
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,120
would you like to try to get a view and
this is after the holiday jim steele

106
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,750
arrest at there was that def con they're
looking at the I was looking for you and

107
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,860
rested the wrong guy

108
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,460
know that actually was was the
electronica privacy or something and

109
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,889
okay if the mother after an epic they're
all there was it was

110
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,469
it was a hacker conference there was a
pair computer privacy conference

111
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:01,199
and the FBI actually the try to make
some arrests there

112
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,810
so the person they arrested had a
similar sounding name to

113
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,580
kevin's handle it was well as the here's
the thing okay there is there there are

114
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,859
three people that

115
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,060
that got interrogated there i jus call
computers freedom and privacy and about

116
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,529
the only thing they have is computers

117
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:18,710
have the freedom or the privacy it took
place in Chicago

118
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,509
I and three people were were harassed in
this was

119
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,919
the first we heard the kevin was on the
run I a person who look like Kevin

120
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,250
who lived in New York was questions
right away

121
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,409
these people are real keystone cops is
looks like everything a question this

122
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,330
guy who look like

123
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,508
agent steel Asian still being a federal
informant that have been trying to get

124
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,199
Kevin arrested for years but then had
also gone on the run himself

125
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,759
somebody who look like him was question
and they actually asked if they could

126
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,080
see his leg because

127
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,580
Asian steel has a wooden leg apparently
so

128
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,818
that was a way of knowing if it was him
or not and then the best one

129
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:58,430
they questioned our own Robert Steele
ex-c_i_a_

130
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,110
intelligence speakers and a who's going
to be on the show I believe

131
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,800
are and he is agent steel I guess and
they've got confused because it was

132
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,389
thought it was the other Asian steel I
don't know so yet they

133
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,830
that they came in they a question a lot
of people but they never found Kevin

134
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:20,758
in 1997 course if I Kevin later but that
time 1997 help tell the FBI with their

135
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,680
search we had

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,050
many people wearing ep kevin Mitnick
masks here justed

137
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,680
showed it a lot of people look like
Kevin that's right that's right

138
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,659
I remembered fag Robert Steele was
giving the keynote speech back in 1994

139
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,078
in about a dove you came up with the
masks and

140
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:39,719
he's got really scared seeing this
happen some video to somewhere

141
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,329
I 1997 was beyond help I'm interview at
beyond help

142
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:46,350
okay good as a you know

143
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,740
a handful but it's a good handful I he
was in prison then again he called us

144
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,529
my cell phone somehow collected on that
but that said you know it's too bad I

145
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:56,480
wish I was there

146
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,540
the same thing same speech different
scenery arm

147
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,860
and then in 2000 he was out of prison
have been released in January 2000 I

148
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,100
and in fact we had the premier freedom
downtime in here at the premiere freedom

149
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,870
downtime that six-hour marathon

150
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,029
I most if it was trying to figure out
how to get the video to work properly

151
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:15,300

205
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,930
gave that to us at the first hole
conference and it's a great film about

206
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:11,670
the

207
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,410
10 minutes long I just about phone
phreaks back in the early seventies

208
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,410
in a rotary phones and and blue boxes
now kinda thing

209
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,029
and it's it's amazing how much hasn't
changed is also amazing course how much

210
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:25,620
has changed over the years

211
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,959
by thats that's a real study the past

212
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,480
I think it's also why it shows is so
important to document things and to

213
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,559
record

214
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,730
this unique culture that were part out
and

215
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,779
I'm just on this glad we're all here to
to share that experience

216
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,170
has moved to the other side of the panel
here and I'm well as well

217
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,260
been awhile since every sinew on the
radio correct

218
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,579
with the what's new in the world over
corporate radio which is what your

219
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:53,300
generally a part of am or some other
scary things that are

220
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,579
it that are happening them sometimes I'm
interviewed on morning radio shows

221
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:01,579
I am and summer the morning shows are
just kind of

222
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,709
disappearing I because

223
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:10,110
the radio stations are suspending people
for improper speech

224
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,679
afraid that if an FCC ruling does go
through that

225
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,319
you know you know people think that
they're not actually

226
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:23,740
trying to crack down on this and so
these people these DJ's just disappear

227
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,029
and then they suddenly come back and
they're not allowed to talk about why

228
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,309
they were gone like they

229
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:31,640
maybe they did joke that they were in
rehab or something so what they taken to

230
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,870
room 101 and then they come back and

231
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,779
right and they're all cured so word
disney's been doing this

232
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,829
and talking to radio DJ the ones that
are left that you know cos Clear Channel

233
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:43,329
has these radio farms are

234
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:48,339
movie in a he does introduce songs in
all the sound files go out like Idaho in

235
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:49,260
Kentucky

236
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,929
am but a lot of people on radio or
really nervous

237
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:58,790
about the the new proposed fines for
indecency

238
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,140
because it's changing to fine teen

239
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,429
broadcast companies to finding
individual broadcasters which means a

240
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,920
manual called steen

241
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,900
says something offend that offend
somebody out there this evening

242
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,750
and they send in a complaint to the FC
already have when I said my name

243
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,490
emmanuel goldstein it it won't be at the
radio station

244
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,329
they get served it'll be a manual add to
the tune up

245
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,049
hundreds of thousands of dollars so
there's lot of people in

246
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:30,620
in some other cool people that are left
on commercial radio right now

247
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,280
are extremely concerned about this and
and both Democrats and Republicans are

248
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,750
on board with that

249
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,890
so i think thats gonna cost some some
serious shake-ups and

250
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,559
and in more censorship in in the media

251
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,620
gym you were here at the very first tell
tale sign about your talk

252
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,169
back in 1994 0 boy is so young

253
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:56,569
how many to remember jim is the first
help or are under my

254
00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:01,130
my previous alias red balaclava about
the MetroCards he tried to hide we on

255
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,280
the road

256
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,209
even even in the New York Times the bag
over your head when you know you're it

257
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:09,010
was in the bag was a balaclava ski mask

258
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,390
I mean we've all seen you after a late
night with a bag over your head

259
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,169
national you soon they like your wife
yeah

260
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:21,679
tell about for var dirty laundry yeah
it's it's it's great being here for the

261
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,539
fifth time around

262
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:27,890
and for I don't know back then you're
talking about

263
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,120
new MetroCard than we were three the
subway system here in New York City

264
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,230
I and how and secure it was how would
never work maybe your

265
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,110
hey we we we had our beliefs about its
its security some of which were

266
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,079
where accurate summers were inaccurate
essentially boils down to what I said

267
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:46,189
way back then

268
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:49,610
if you want to get one right out of a
motor car do pretty much came with

269
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,390
almost no trouble

270
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,380
every so often you you hear about people
getting busted for bending a match card

271
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,140
using it for one ride

272
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,339
or as recently happened at a station
near Central Park somebody who is

273
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,309
bedding discarded MetroCards and selling
the rights to tourists at half price

274
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:10,799
got into a little altercation with his
competition and

275
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,270
ended up in a box cutter fight

276
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,760
well so here's an interesting and the
other side a better cards is is also

277
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,120
something I spoke about the first help
which is that if you decide to

278
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,380
go on a crime spree I don't take

279
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,140
take the subway or at least don't use a
MetroCard about now you can't do

280
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,270
otherwise because they could be tracked

281
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,610
and there's at least two cases are
murders that were cracked by the fact

282
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,839
that the

283
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:42,669
alias provided fell apart when they
checked the guys MetroCard

284
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,939
so if you kill somebody should jump to
turn turnstile jumping turnstiles you

285
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,650
feel so very right Delta

286
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,949
don't have your card say oh yes 10
minutes after the killing he

287
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:54,179
he was on the lam at the station where
the murder occurred

288
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,049
because all you have to do is get a
MetroCard that went through turns out a

289
00:16:58,049 --> 00:16:58,839
certain time

290
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,510
you can find me quite a lot of money in
the criminal underground by selling

291
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,000
Metro cars that were used at certain
times at a convenient to the criminal

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,319
and

293
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,010
you know I Q no did you kill somebody at
this time

294
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,270
would be nice if you had a MetroCard it
that show that you were in Brooklyn at

295
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,089
this time instead

296
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:18,720
we plan to get the sixth hope to have a
booth in which we will sell alibi

297
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,390
look better cars I'm just saying it's an
idea you know he should explore

298
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,490
alibi cards jeff welcome thank you

299
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,070
an tell us tell us your recollections of
hope and

300
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,030
other thing this this is actually my
third the the first time I

301
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:38,639
I came it was very interesting I help to
set up the whole first day in

302
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,799
at the end of the day they said somebody
just just got here now need some help

303
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,260
who wants to go sigh

304
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,590
I'll call I went downstairs and I was
the first time I met burn yes

305
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,580
and he had the little machine that we
were going to print all the badges that

306
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,460
year

307
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,740
and we were literally I was up all night

308
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,159
just printing badges it took ninety
seconds per batch

309
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,230
and bernie had the room so I insisted
4:30 go to bed

310
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,039
you know I can I can set up with this I
already miss my bus is

311
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,010
but we we spent a lotta time and I we
had some fun

312
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,710
yet I think I got one in my wallet to on
I have to this is your

313
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,419
the how many you have the year the
collection

314
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,789
all the different badges and things we
should make a different every year this

315
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,270
year we have our benso

316
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,030
who expected that everyone's asking
what's the car can be like this year

317
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,280
how how high-tech you gonna go all we
went to let other direction

318
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,668
and we we have velcro armband

319
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,520
my cousin say so no less difficult to
procure then some high tech soul

320
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,250
yeah I mean basically we're told at
certain points that this is impossible

321
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,120
to make

322
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,640
white house in about the saga that you
went through personal there are no

323
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,700
company is apparently in the United
States or anywhere that manufacture

324
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,350
armbands just as as a

325
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,549
stock line-item I

326
00:18:55,549 --> 00:19:00,309
so you know finding a factor that we do
this I there's a there's a a type

327
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,480
a segment of the garment industry called
the cutting room

328
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,850
I obtained the phone number for cutting
room

329
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,730
and call them up and said I i would like
to buy some fabric and have you cut it

330
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,130
for me into armband size pieces

331
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,029
and was told no we don't do that so if
anyone can explain to me what are

332
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:20,150
cutting room does if not cut fabric

333
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,440
I would really like to now and and and
so this whole thing I

334
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,309
to we finally found a small factory that
was willing to manufacture them for us

335
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,990
and then we have them printed and and
they're on your arms today if you're

336
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,070
here

337
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,149
it's actually a might get a whole lot
more than that

338
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,279
spending weeks and weeks tracking down
various vendors try finding lost

339
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,960
packages at one point

340
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,950
and just getting people to do things
that they're supposed to do in the first

341
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,440
place and getting to do the right so

342
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,390
UPS still thinks that approx one of the
six boxes are man's is lost

343
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,400
so yeah if you were an armband from that
last box

344
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,620
no UPS owes you money for

345
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,789
arm what else well I guess maybe

346
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:06,220
Jim I have something that serve relates
to to our

347
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,470
our previous ok conferences and ed is
current as well

348
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,210
do you remember the good old days where
the phone company and the defense

349
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,260
department with send out notices saying

350
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,470
the hackers are having the convention
battened down the hatches

351
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,150
you remember those are you may know how
it happened last time to right expected

352
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,039
to happen again this time

353
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,100
well well I did I did some looking on
the net

354
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,539
earlier today and yesterday hoping to 5

355
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,110
what the latest the alert was about

356
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,840
it turns out I can't find any alert
about us

357
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,080
however I do know what the defense
department is afraid over now

358
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,820
would you like to see it

359
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:55,820
I think so cocaine's

360
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,690
your you're referring of course to the
whole GPS thing I yes

361
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,789
yes indeed we spoke about this a few
months ago

362
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,850
coca-cola has a contest well

363
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,360
thats that's not love them I'm not a
winner

364
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,700
everybody drinks coca-cola is a minor

365
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,840
tyco doctor cotton coca-cola has a
contest where

366
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,908
they have a 120 ken's nationwide

367
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,960
we we were speculating on what this was
birdie in Irish sure was some sort of

368
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,240
RFID with GPS

369
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,679
to cell phone they put a cell phone with
the auto dialer in the 120 coke cans

370
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,880
and what happens is you can only talk
the coca-cola

371
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,870
at that point they say okay sometime in
the next three weeks

372
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,309
at any time at any place we will swoop
it

373
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:51,690
perhaps with a helicopter because it's
more impressive when we fell but

374
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,289
and and give you some incredible gift
maybe an SUV

375
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:59,129
maybe I don't know well turns out that
the defense

376
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,770
Information Systems agency's agency

377
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,309
thinks that this is a high security risk

378
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:09,460
because heaven knows they could swoop in
on a member

379
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,640
about dice or whatever the acronym is
pronounced

380
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,330
in a secure area and you can't have
coca-cola and its helicopters

381
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:21,260
over area 51 for sure

382
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,879
so now they've sent out a memo tell you
every what to treat

383
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,809
cans of coke as if they were any sort of
two-way radio

384
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,820
the same security brokers

385
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,928
this is what they spend their time
worrying about they don't have to worry

386
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:39,039
about us breaking them down

387
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,669
they could do it themselves but it it
would be fun to see the US military in

388
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,409
coca-cola like in a big fire fight
though that

389
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:52,700
have

390
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,869
I think I think ok my twin perfect

391
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:59,610
on there is a is a story about wifi in
the defense department so what you want

392
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,340
to know there was a similar story a

393
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,779
few years ago during the big for be
crazy or there's little horrible little

394
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:05,789
dolls that

395
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:09,059
like record what you're saying and play
them back in weird

396
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:13,960
intonations I the National Security
Agency in a CIA were very upset

397
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,119
that employers are bringing for bees
into their office and

398
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,519
for bees are recording classified
information and blurting it out in

399
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,749
weird intonations sellout at another
case where the end

400
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:28,779
are government is very afraid of these
common items what happened to in the

401
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,869
last week or so other something
involving

402
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:35,249
Wireless communication and the Defense
Department realizing that

403
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:38,529
hey they can they can get this outside
the building in the parking lot how do

404
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:40,360
we turn this off

405
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,100
I R for violence murder Homeland
Security in setup a WiFi network said

406
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,179
connect from one building to another 121
engineer

407
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,690
employees decided to accesses network

408
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,490
in a new building he couldn't access
after he moved so he set up wifi link

409
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,610
Anna it was open and not a cryptid in
partner common security isn't secure is

410
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,269
I'll get out so what they did they shut
it down early just passing them on to

411
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:06,009
Round

412
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:10,119
one match after it on CNN a shut it down

413
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,940
you never know don't have so much
confidence in their abilities

414
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,710
so the males have a story there by two
make reference to or something perhaps

415
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,190
at the

416
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,200
as a memorable story of the past say a
year two years since we were

417
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,830
here the last conference for checking on
the air

418
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,869
okay I have some letters that I can meet
people who have written in

419
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:36,190
on how many your written it off the hook
ever in your lives

420
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,789
that's our audience right there

421
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:44,539
okay a little more enthusiastic there
I'll th a 26 yr dot com is our

422
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:49,450
are address and our show is usually
heard Wednesday nights from 7 to 8 p.m.

423
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,259
on WBAI New York and we are now until
ten o'clock

424
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:56,820
also on WBAI New York and culture for
WBAI you know

425
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:03,820
the

426
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,100
and then where else could you possibly
do a show like off the hook in so many

427
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,300
the other programs that they have

428
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,780
on a weekly basis I we're very lucky
here in New York and a lot of your from

429
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,660
different parts the world across the
country

430
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,760
where stations like the I did not exist
and we just traded to the same Clear

431
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,720
Channel crap

432
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,860
i coming from all different angles some
some cities have like every single

433
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,360
station owned by the same people

434
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,040
it's horrendous some I'm leaving its
satellite radio and the on par that too

435
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,060
and Emmanuel they own everything there
was actually AM

436
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,830
a town out in the midwest where there
was an emergency situation and the

437
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,570
police couldn't get in contact with
anyone in any of that six radio stations

438
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,210
because they were

439
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,860
operated by one person who was out to
lunch or something unbelievable

440
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,100
but here we have a new york we have a
station that

441
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,320
has all kinds of interesting things
always live people they're they're

442
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,600
definitely live people right now at a
radio station

443
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,820
Manning this broadcast thank you by the
way I so

444
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,010
as long as their station KTVI New York
there is hope and I urge everybody here

445
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,460
to join the station one way or another I
for

446
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,710
25 bucks you can be a member station and
not only that you can vote and

447
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,740
and and move ahead in that particular
direction set the stage doesn't

448
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,590
fall off track like I did a couple years
ago because that's always a threat and I

449
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,140
believe it when you have a fifty
thousand what station in the middle of

450

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,180

a lot of people so it's

452
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,540
we're lucky we're lucky we have this
resource and I hope we fine arts

453
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,110
protected

454
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,630
soviet were being broadcast live over
the radio stations I sure hope we are

we have we verified that we are being
okay good

456
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,120

is also the the call letters are ninety

457
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,080
9.5

458
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,220
that callers that the frequency its
simulcast on shortwave 7415

459
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,990
not right now though is it I'm is well
it on now is not

460
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,650
now that there is no recession simulcast
horse on Wednesdays and we always get

461
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,680
letters from people maybe some you're
here

462
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,420
I wanna simulcast the radio station is
well there off the hook on Wednesday

463

nights and

464
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,889
of course there's no problem doing that
all you want to get certified letters

465
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,240
from Oz or lawyers

466
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,730
giving permission anything like that if
you wanna simulcast go right ahead as

467
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:10,260
long as

468
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,500
you know you give credit to the show
into the station that's not a problem at

469
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:13,770
all

470
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,980
and you don't like the margin between
don't like commercials the

471
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,370
the artistry mistake anchor June system
right there but is it jokes you're gonna

472
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,100
be our first

473
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,780
Rodrigues wanna that the great thing
about what chance does

474
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,080
if you've ever music got we get our
callers I mean we have callers from all

475
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,810
around the world and it's just kinda
it's great to get in and outside

476
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,470
perspective when we're talking about

477
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,000
in a local local topics hmm if you ever
listen to the station

478
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,530
over the Internet its most likely
because addresses efforts at

479
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,860
that you're able to do that I week after
week

480
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,340
he just make sure that that we stay on
from

481
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,480
does need to the archiving as well

482
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,930
yes actually every week i jus all hands
on work

483
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,770
but does it all work so it's very
magical and hard to understand

484
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,820
I now it's really simple actually I have
a radio at home

485
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,480
that feeds into a computer and that
computer turned into an mp3 file and

486
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,750
send it off to a server in Colorado
summer

487
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,950
and we have a bunch of other servers the
grab that signal on spread out all over

488
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,730
the world in

489
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,070
when you connects to one of the servers
you're listening

490
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,399
to the stream its originating from my
home that some

491
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,620
now a commercial radio station

492
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,480
that kinda thing with I would cost huge
amounts of money and probably wouldn't

493
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,350
work as well

494
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,720
probably and you know that in the hacker
spirit we just make it work somehow

495
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,850
there's a while

496
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,870
that's quite a period of time where
Jones was a sponsor for the 24/7

497
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:55,310
simulcasting PA I love the Internet and
I was very very critical period in our

498
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,330
history where

499
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,000
we had to get the word out to people
throughout the world as to what's

500
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,960
happening at Station

501
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,000
so yeah %uh that was a dark period

502
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,140
our people need to know is going on and
so we put up the stream 24/7 an hourly

503
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,630
hotel

504
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,820
and I I should probably mention that we
do all this with donated van with

505
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,950
donated servers

506
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,650
I am we're always looking for more so if
you've got a big pipe out there you're

507
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,610
willing to

508
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:26,040
I'll issues I'll let me know email thx
going to Canada com

509
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,090
fine june's is right there yes

510
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,730
and on top of all that there's every
show

511
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,750
that we've ever done I think online at
2600 dot com slash off the hook

512
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,940
you can go and listen to the whole
history the shop

513
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,840
with the current capacity of all this
magic that you do

514
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,320
I at the current rate so we're streaming
we can well we have

515
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,230
probably enough to handle loss anywhere
between six hundred to a thousand

516
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,070
muslims

517
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:00,300
once and we get a pretty good percentage
in that on a daily basis anyway

518
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,580
anytime there's an emergency ernie you
know were coverage from Iraq or whatever

519
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,000
that jumps up to you almost beyond what
we can handle so

520
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,950
again if you can help us out we really
appreciate it

521
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:18,950
are we a shapeshifter here who are does
the layout the 20/20 magazine

522
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,080
and I learned four years ago just how
much he's actually worth when the

523
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,310
when the US government to help him for
half a million dollars bail

524
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,360
at the half Republican convention in
Philadelphia on earth

525
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,060
how many saw his talk in 2008's 2k about
the ramsey

526
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,080
was a very small room to commit to many
I

527
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,610
yeah he and down there check it maybe
can't other

528
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,630
very quick story as to what happened to
you when when you went down there

529
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,840
where you lived in Philadelphia what
happened to you yen Philadelphia

530
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,250
Convention

531
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,080
what did you do that that made it
worthwhile to lock you up for half a

532
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,149
million dollars bail

533
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,720
well i helped organize some the protest
beforehand and

534
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,780
doing the actual prevent convention I
couldn't get near any the protest

535
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,930
nowhere close to as a fill up police did
such a good job shutting down the city

536
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,940
so mmm

537
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,280
any way I can get anywhere near the
protest and I was charged with

538
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,330
organizing and leading protest and

539
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,800
they said that I had this amazing
superhuman ability of where I pointed

540
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,330
people would follow

541
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,750
her are I also had his other amazing
ability of not being able to be caught

542
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,270
on videotape

543
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,790
we saw the evidence that we saw the
evidence to be walking down the stree

544
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,330
with a cell phone talking to somebody
and I think it was me we're talking to

545
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,870
because I was in philadelphia that date

546
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,680
telling you what was going on there's
only one to say something see how

547
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,980
sheik you want to eat the microphone
okay

548
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,600
are so they use as evidence that you
were a threat

549
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,440
and as you walked away for about a week
Ryan I'm I'm

550
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,350
my first manned major charged with
possession of an instrument of crime

551
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,400
which was the cell phone in fact

552
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,780
how many remember the the cover 2600
with a cell phone in the handcuffs

553
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,379
his hands his I think we fought the
handcuffs

554
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,850
right and was your cell phone it was 10
the cell phones that we're using per

555
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,670
communications Nextel phones

556
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,180
yes Nextel's very dangerous yeah all
they were listening in on the Nextel

557
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,780
phones I believe

558
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,080
I think somewhat yeah yes so if you if
you plan on on communicating

559
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,850
surreptitiously perhaps that's not the
best option yes

560
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:34,610
one there favorite ways listening is
tackling won the People's holding it and

561
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,020
then there on your network group

562
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,060
I low-tech but it works I think maybe
all you need is a crypto phone to

563
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,060
communicate with everyone else happened
uprise

564
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:50,179
they can't akio then to yeah are so tell
us what the talking this year

565
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,550
this talk I A this year's about mayhem
mischief I can join the fun in adding to

566
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,070
the chaos at the

567
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,530
RNC which he just gave the talk

568
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:04,170

575
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,820

things that they're planning

578
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,419
what kinds of things are people planning
to to counter that

579
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:40,660
as a demonstrations mean that this young
up the whole

580
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:45,150
this whole area were in the frozen zone
right now I heard estimates around like

581
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,330
five hundred thousand people and

582
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,010
there's going to be marches no big rah
rah marches were

583
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,730
1200 1000 future people march 19 blocks

584
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,380
19 blocks will be cordoned off I heard

00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,310
have it's been the a along

600
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,690
trip right lot of lotta emails lot
effort

601
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,580
a like the previous ones other
conference is a virtual

602
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,770
essentially a virtually were put on my
virtual organization

603
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:07,560
our where a lot of people doing day jobs
and saying what time with the email

604
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,130
and making all kinds of plans and then

605
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,620
comes together in what we discover is
that all of our incredible efforts

606
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,100
you know a lot hours like messages and
phone calls up like that

607
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,200
are really a fraction up the effort that
goes in

608
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,000
by speakers and then by the volunteers
to help out during the show

609
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,830
so it is a you put in a lot and you get

709
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,050
shop at 10 in the morning I mean you
know something's going on here

710
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:41,280
and to run on time so when you get up to
last couple years since we

711
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,470
had you here last I'm surviving and as I
said this morning for those %uh view

712
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,460
that's left n

713
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,090
collective intelligence Google on
collective intelligence and quotes

714
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,540
and you will discover the wisdom of the
crowd are

715
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,390
the public is starting to come into its
own the Internet

716
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,920
is in fact enabling people to come
together at every level

717
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,040
in every location and put together more
information

718
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,180
better information then the liars in the
government

719
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,690
and the liars in the corporation are so
you now have the power for information

720
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:15,970
but

721
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,580
only if you structure your self only few
self-organize

722
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,299
I'm sorry if that sounds like a
commercial but I'm not selling anything

723
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,800
get your act together are you speaking
for like four hours tomorrow

724
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,680
correct no I'm not speaking for four
hours tomorrow I am giving two 30-minute

725
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,089
briefs and everything that screwed up an
intelligent senator Roberts I just at a

726
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,750
press release while I was in my room

727
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,550
the few hours ago %uh senator Roberts
got ten percent of it right

728
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,680
he missed the other ninety percent i
press release covers that

729
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,299
thing is gonna be taking questions and
that's why it's gonna go for

730
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,460
that's exactly right it will call for
hours and at midnight if any %uh viewer

731
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,220
interest that will have a panel

732
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:59,220
on crushing New York how exactly what do
you mean by that

733
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,910
well let's start with the nineteen
twenties water system all you know about

734
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,399
that

735
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,750
yes if if if if that is somehow

736
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:14,180
incapacitated and a fire starts in one
of these tenements

737
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,529
you read that article in the new city
burns down you read that article in the

738
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,430
end then let's go from there to the
plague

739
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,560
to see the plague yes

740
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,740
I Leanna Heart in a minute left in its
wake when I go to billions new

741
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:32,710
girlfriend well tell I'm sorry that was
a cheap shot

742
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:37,960
I don't think you'll be vice president
also the water system in its

743
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:43,360
inherent weakness at the risk being
serious

744
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,600
there's a very very important book

745
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:51,400
by guy named Charles her I think it is
called normal accidents dealing with

746
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,590
Iris technologies

747
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,270
and what he says this is a standard book
in all Masters of Public Administration

748
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,720
courses simple systems have single
points of failure that are easy to

749
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,610
diagnose

750
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:08,090
an easy to fix complex systems have
multiple points a failure that

751
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,420
interact in strange incomprehensible
ways on the way down

752
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:18,420
and they're almost impossible to
diagnose and fix we have a constellation

753
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,740
of complex systems all of which were
designed

754
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:27,760
for AXA got not access man the minute
you introduce suicidal terrorism

755
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,110
and billions have seriously pissed off
muslims

756
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,420
you are in deep arm accurate

757
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,280

763
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:02,279
everybody else on the a on the guest
list what we I can see at this bright

764
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,160
light

765
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,080
rob is coming up okay in a minute so we
have route to look forward to

766
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,710
just present the crypto from manager at
that panel

767
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,480
as there is pitching wasn't

768
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,650
bernie how something else I I know more
about the whole crypto from

769
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,660
system then others appear tell us

770
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,210
if this is something that is likely to
work something that will likely use it

771
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,260
definitely works

772
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,590
on this is a system whereby

773
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,760
%uh private individuals can now

774
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,030
%uh almost for the first time in this
country communique securely between one

775
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:38,760
another

776
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,780
I could call any member this audience
naked call me on a

777
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,310
para founds that were I'll modified

778
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:50,060
up my crops group in the Netherlands to

779
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,820
encrypt your conversation real time both
ways with a fairly secure algorithm

780
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,680
and it uses GSM

781
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,310
standard which ed now letter carriers
here in this country is now

782
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:07,120
on because is coming down and you can't
play with this technology yourself for

783
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,250
free using the free

784
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,800
our client software I think you're
equipped to found .de

785
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,940
you can now add you can download that
program play with it communicate

786
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,430
securely by voice

787
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:20,660
with anyone else over the Internet on
and

788
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:24,129
now you can explore you can ask make a
wish on the pendulum that one person has

789
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:24,990
a found

790
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:29,040
you can communicate with them PPC over
the past line at the end

791
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,990
inning me today to that's right I'm
sorry I did make a day to call over a

792
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,460
pop fly not over the amide

793
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:37,560
night thank you for breaking on it's
really exciting because up until now the

794
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,000
really

795
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,650
has been allotted like secure fans
usually secure not have more really that

796
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,260
secure

797
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,040
this is as secure as private sector has
ever come up with

798
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,520
and these guys really a lot we owe a lot
to them for doing all this work to do

799
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,390
this because

800
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:56,029
in privacy is important so do we I'm
sure on Force intelligence agencies ur

801
00:46:56,030 --> 00:47:00,000
take a very dim view of this but so-far
captions not been outlawed

802
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,950
and now we should use it as much as we
can until it is and then maybe I'm just

803
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:07,290
thinking about is that in europe it's
kinda I'm especially in Germany

804
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,450
the at the accept this because
especially in in European countries they

805
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,240
love economic espionage

806
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,140
so the companies they are actually
liking corruption because it'll keep the

807
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,810
other

808
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:20,950
other companies there other countries is
flying up

809
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,880
good morning economic espionage is very
big in Europe %ah also in this country

810
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,900
just applied economics buying going on
but to whatever whether the government

811
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,530
or

812
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,980
are or industrial corporate espionage

813
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,050
for worry about if you have a company
with it with the technology or worry

814
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:37,370
about being stolen

815
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,660
on this is very valuable tool to have
been up until now you really didn't have

816
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,420
access to it so

817
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:46,450
kudos these guys i speaking of kudos

818
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:51,100
there are many closer to our our
resident designer and artist jan who is

819
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,110
come up with incredible time you

820
00:47:54,110 --> 00:48:00,830
%ah

821
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,880
I can tell something about the whole lot
thought process that went into creating

822
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,670
this

823
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:08,700
artistic thing that's going on i i'd

824
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,200
trying not to all my words are are
failing me but you've been to the hopes

825
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:12,670
up

826
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,820
the past I think you will have noticed
that this one has more art work going on

827
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,620
than ever before that's because we have
Jan

828
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,980
was about 10 designed 26

829
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,460
not all any

830
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,430
no yeah I'm basically

831
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,259
I let's heaven a ban a friend of a
friend

832
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,160
the band back home in colorado called
frenchmen and they have a song

833
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,040
and what blindness on is I'm into
fascism for the fashion

834
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:47,650
and now is sorted my motto with this
whole thing

835
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:52,090
what I wanted to do is talk about make a
statement about

836
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,800
please stay it and how corporations
propagandize

837
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,460
everywhere now and I just wanted to
bring that in with

838
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,790
he pulls an irony all over the place so
what you see in this room

839
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,050
is is homage to some

840
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,240
some fascists photographs I found

841
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,660
from the Nazi Party rally is

842
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:19,190
from Democratic National Conventions in
1861

843
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:23,130
and some are 1860 some other

844
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:27,420
all vintage photographs I found and I
came up with just a simple scheme

845
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:32,200
to recreate it with spray-paint and here
it is

846
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,540
so we have tall skinny red banners
scalloping

847
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:40,070
in all kinds of fancy

848
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:43,730
you're out there in radio land this
looks like the island's funeral

849
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,770
have some your work jan was unit to

850
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:49,790
controversial for seventh Avenue where
we have some nice

851
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:54,970
Windows that we're showing 1- your
paintings don't do me one described that

852
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:58,040
yeah I finally been censored and

853
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:04,600
British

854
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,050
privet the front windows at the hotel
Pennsylvania a very big windows are

855
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,530
facing seventh Avenue

856
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,720
and I came up with you campuses which I
did

857
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,440
paintings oil on canvas then go sell

858
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,470
and when depicted an astronaut

859
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:23,220
on planet Earth holding an upside-down
flag

860
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:27,280
so that's a sign in to send the flag has
51 stars on it

861
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,480
in the astronauts mask is monolith from

862
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,540
2001 and

863
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,540
the whole idea is this is a hacker on
planet Earth

864
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,590
raising the flag to send distress

865
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:45,390
did 251 star you know represents our
international policy

866
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:49,440
lately and

867
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,630
apparently this is too controversial
people II talk some people the hotel and

868
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,650
I mean they a slap that pass to upper
management but

869
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,730
what was happening apparently were
people walking by on the sidewalk in

870
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,280
there

871
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,730
hardly disturbed by seeing such a
display Inc and actually work on hotel

872
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,810
look on health how long after week we
took them down to saying that they were

873
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,920
still disturbed by

874
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,000
I know what they expect us to do at that
point they asked if they wanted us to

875
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,880
to do something a back in time and fix
it but the

876
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,140
the posters are still up just on the
window the stand the window we we have

877
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,970
all kinds of other

878
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:26,100
poses reporting up as well I'll addition
to Jen we have

879
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,760
by an artist from kaback who have made
all the big brother posters

880
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,100
that you see all over the place is well
Witcher of they're they're incredible

881
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,940
they really are

882
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:38,350
around back to me right now no it's not
it's not hitler's big brother he's got a

883
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,400
mustache but

884
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,060
display make that clear keeps staring at
me

885
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,850
creeps me out no matter where she was
protecting you

886
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,670
I think that the big brother is also
subjective some concern actually if you

887
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,280
go up the other main elevators and

888
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,530
in the hotel have to the a at the 18th
floor if you look straight down the

889
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:58,230
hallway

890
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:01,410
you can see straight into one earlier
one rooms

891
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:05,490
and banners is right on the back to the
room you can clearly see

892
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:08,990
that there are you know all these these
red banners coming down red and black

893
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:14,250
very calm and very scary and the hotel
expressed little concern about

894
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,490
fastest keep the doors

895
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:21,830
I so

896
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,900
this our work has me quite nippy impact
not only on us thinking

897
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,170
wow that's great this this communism for
the fashions

898
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:33,540
as it is but has made an impression on
other people as well

899
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,640
if you wanna see the Jen's our work with
the sounded upside-down flag

900
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,580
the Good I Hope dotnet on the homepage
for this conference you can

901
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:45,759
you can see what caused the controversy
and if you come to the conference you

902
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,450
can see even more controversy as we

903
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:50,540
bring the panel's until Sunday night
with

904
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,100
I guess things that people be talking
about for quite some time

905
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,140
so while yet we haven't we artwork here
we have

906
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:01,210
we have ok as a technical talks we've
got great keynote speakers

907
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:04,920
and a whole lotta fun as far as

908
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,030
the crowd just people that show up to
these things really is really cause he

909
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,140
saw you

910
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,310
after not having seen is for last couple
of years

911
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,680
so again if people are out there they
wanna come to the conference is taking

912
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,960
place at the hotel Pennsylvania

913
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,420
for the next few days over the weekend I
ran across street from Madison Square

914
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,960
Garden and Penn Station

915
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,100
and more information at WWW dot hope
that net

916
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,140
that you listen to a live to our radio
broadcaster

917
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,190
off the hook on WBAI New York and

918
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:38,260
as anyone else leslie has are out there
and we all we have organizers from other

919
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,250
hacker convention

920
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:42,730
management her connection to rob tell us
something about your hacker conventions

921
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:49,730
over in how long can people see rock

922
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:54,380
I realized hacker convention in 2001
Amsterdam

923
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,150
or helped organize it together with a
bunch of other people our

924
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,210
that was fun a you were there share

925
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:06,420
remembers I'm week we do our conventions
out on fields in the open with

926
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:11,310
big-tent serve as a as a camping trip
more than as a big city thing

927
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:14,790
which is different there's there's less
people just stepping in off the street

928
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,700
it's more about

929
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,470
opening crowd thing but it's different
because everybody's camping out there

930
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,480
much closer together it's

931
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,780
fun in different also very funny way i
Mees you I went to that

932
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,160
that conference or one at the hacker
camps

933
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,390
you but you know what alive you should
go because there they really are a lot

934
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:32,960
of fun

935
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,900
really are it is it is amazing I was
able to go to hell

936
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,450
and two the CCC camp this past summer

937
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:44,240
and it was unbelievable their incredible

938
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,300
being at how I think I actually gain the
light by actually camping out I see

939
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,540
down a tent actually donated by rock arm

940
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,720
and it was amazing it was whose probably

941
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,940
love them when the most memorable hacker
events I've ever been to

942
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:04,060
even just the the infrastructure that
goes into dollars

943
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:07,570
power generators never real place

944
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,740
kind like your kinda on a different
level since

945
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,910
the campsites were just all in different
areas in

946
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:17,290
everybody was getting it was it was just
amazing something have to see to

947
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:21,779
believe ensued understand it's really
weird seeing all these tents

948
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,010
with like cables going in and the and
and

949
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:29,600
just the glow inside you walk by Tencent
people it is nigga

950
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,750
her that they're talking to each other
on IRC

951
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:37,810
10 necessarily kinda pathetic in some
ways but also kinda interesting

952
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:41,220
I was coming intense how many view

953
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:46,100
I was gonna do that how many have you
ever camped out and had WiFi access

954
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,450
faster than what you have at home on
your

955
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:53,170
here broad bands you guys get the at the
the access that you get

956
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:57,090
didn't have a microwave link to to
berlin

957
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:01,470
I was with you I think straight CCC camp
there is a link to prevent

958
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:04,580
there was a a radio link I think was a
hundred and forty-four

959
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,810
two times in 140 for megabits I'm

960
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,880
we have at our a health thing we had

961
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,550
a Gigabit we had another Gigabit spared
from the University

962
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:18,900
we're on their campus sorry we had a lot
of bandwidth

963
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,550
a and we have that the network thing
down to the point where people would set

964
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:24,290
up their tent and as they were setting
it

965
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:27,730
as they were still busy setting it up
somebody walk up and say

966
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,350
I got a network cable for you it's
already plugged in it to 100 megabits

967
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,310
if you're running servers or something
let me know cuz I can plug it into a

968
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:35,660
gigabit port

969
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,830
I and

970
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:42,250
a that was so funny receivers
interesting people got

971
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:46,000
really like the 4 100 megabits with a
throughput

972
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,710
are in their tent which really throw
them but the germans

973
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:53,400
are give us a challenge last year
because their camp actually look

974
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,570
much cooler can't look really talk about
artwork they really have not completed

975
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,680
amazing artwork

976
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,130
at night had all these light projections
on the tent

977
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,480
really psychedelic stuff happening with
lights they haven't

978
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,560
alien craft landing place rockets put up
in

979
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,299
loads and loads have these plasma lights
are half buried in the ground so at

980
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,410
night you said

981
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:19,379
the suddenly this field with all these
half ball sticking out of the ground

982
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,460
