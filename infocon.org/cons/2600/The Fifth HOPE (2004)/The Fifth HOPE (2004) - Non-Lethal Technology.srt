1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,690
Sergi perfect or the reference urges its
s

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:10,300
in the biography though anyway

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,219
we have one announcement make that is
that the social engineering panel will

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,400
also be simulcast down in the movie area
on the second floor

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,369
I can get a little crowded so if you
wanna go down there and check it out

6
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:23,650
air-conditioned splendor

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,689
feel free it's already smell a little
bad with the crowd over there

8
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,559
see in jello now so you know is your
better judgment and without further ado

9
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:34,680
I'll turn it over to gonzo

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,680
thanks for the pauses see the checks got
to everyone

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,960
so as I've been having

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,559
the times over that's it

13
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,559
the

14
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,160
don't spin now loving to bring the fed's
in here

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,250
matter so let's talk some technology

16
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,389
nonlethal technology what I'm going to
do is

17
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:12,619
talk about electromagnetic pulse bombs
I'm sure it's going to deal do you guys

18
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:13,369
in her to

19
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:16,569
its somewhere to

20
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:20,049
artists for those of us who've seen the
matrix when they had the the squiggles

21
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:20,560
and they had a

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,389
should not pose of to kill it its
similar to that in some ways

23
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:29,369
but are going to the whole military
applications other than

24
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,689
and what Big Brother has done with it so
the effects of it

25
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,090
what was first noted it was in world war
two

26
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,999
during some high-altitude nuclear
weapons testing one was marked on it was

27
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,199
a result was a short

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,090
are always hundreds and Anna seconds and
it was an intense

29
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,569
I want to Magnotta polls burst on
radiate out from point of an impact

30
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:58,239
not getting weaker and weaker Z goes out
and the

31
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,669
well little its strongest around point
of impact

32
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:06,329
but what all do is it'll make bearing
feels a voltage couple votes

33
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,659
on anything that's exposed to all
trickling copper wiring

34
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:14,060
are railway signals

35
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,700
even some parts have all my bills are
are subject to it so

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,180
what makes it so important for the
military use is that in the end you can

37
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,849
fry

38
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,510
just about any type of watch a little
equipment you want radios

39
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,609
anything and given how it's

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,750
you know are the strength love deloach a
magnetic poles

41
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,269
and its durability up a quick min you
know

42
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:40,390
you clean and a full literally losing
just about everything for

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,640
mmm for whatever you've got going with
them are

44
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,709
the damage it suffered some weird
actually love lightning strike

45
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,870
and I've gotta transparency will show
everyone shows

46
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,980
I'm what spike was like when it hurts
sonar some commercial

47
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,858
computer equipment as a specially at
risk because of the amount of metal

48
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,310
oxide semiconductors on it or

49
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,909
maas devices are and because

50
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,159
you don't really need a lot of energy to
destroying and you know

51
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,108
third cheaper to use in mass quantities
so that really puts all at risk for

52
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,590
and what will happen is a cause

53
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,709
a key breakdown I'm not so because

54
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,180
what wonders any excess tens voltage a
new

55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,689
actually cause physical hardware to
break down that's dig a profound and if

56
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:30,999
it's not strong enough to cause any
thermal damage

57
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:34,560
are the power supplies and equipment
will still

58
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,790
create enough energy to further that
polls & so gonna get fried from anyone

59
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,179
so want the team's equipment can still
be

60
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,389
reliable are the shielding of the
equipment still doesn't provide a full

61
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,269
the fans because

62
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,870
any cables or expose copper wiring is
can act as an antenna

63
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,900
and it'll fuel any electromagnetic pulse
into it it'll take whatever you've got

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,120
out months is over technological base
for

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,180
are there's a lot to what

66
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,239
most if it were my head ok so I'm not
into science and math that's why majored

67
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:09,859
in English

68
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,040
so we'll have to figure out happen this
but it's been around for a while

69
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,709
and the important stuff in this area
it's explosively punt

70
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,810
flux compression generators not to be
confused with the flux capacitor

71
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,720
by the way I'm propellant were an
explosive

72
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,470
are magnetic 100 dynamic or MHD
generators

73
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,530
and a range of are the HPM devices

74
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:37,509
the one thats leading in that area is a
virtual cathode

75
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:40,580
oscillator or more commonly known as a
ver cater

76
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,500
and there's a number of experimental
designs have been tested on it and

77
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,840
there's a lot of work that shows about
it being just

78
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,819
to do with Google on admin it'll come up

79
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:57,819
so what it looks like shimon management
transparency before

80
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:03,189
road can you on Salon so

81
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:06,610
the colors sure the spike on a on the
the nuclear EMP

82
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,219
transient is the the red one the green
one is a mention about

83
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,389
in the lightning strike here down

84
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,960
in two forks compression generator

85
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,060
purple one goes up in just drop

86
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,129
so

87
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,169
let's talk about explosively pumped
compression generators

88
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,359
murder its all technology-related

89
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,949
to the bomb designs are the first one
actually was shown by Clarence fowler

90
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,629
and Los Alamos National Labs and the
week fifties

91
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:43,710
and since that time they've been a
number

92
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,370
have two sons have been built toasted
here russia's got them

93
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,419
number other countries as well the

94
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,900
and what it'll do is it'll produce
electrical energy arts

95
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,750
a number of mega jewels and tens or
hundreds of microseconds

96
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,370
in a take compressed shot a

97
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,270
and no I don't know how much make a
jeweler's but from what I understand

98
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:04,799
it's

99
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,159
it's up there the power levels are
actually

100
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:13,629
are measured in Terra wants to tens of
Terra wants and the MCG's can be used

101
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:17,349
not directly or as a one-shot post power
for microwave tubes

102
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:22,400
so to give an idea of how strong it is
power produced by a large

103
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,650
FCG Xander between 10 to 1000 times
greater

104
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,909
turn awaiting strike so on the idea
behind it

105
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:33,210
is to use a fast explosive quickly to
compress magnetic fields

106
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,509
it takes a lot to the energy from the
explosive into

107
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,949
I feel the initial field in I prefer the
explosion

108
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,879
as for these players start charge and
that works because I it's made available

109
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,120
by an external source

110
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,199
a high voltage capacitor bank or marks
bank the smaller FCG or

111
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,060
in MHT device in theory anyway so I can
create

112
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,830
current on intensive kilograms to make a
amps

113
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,550
will being proper for the use variety of
different patterns are available

114
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,250
but dont most common Livermore Co axe a
sea of shoes

115
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,770
and it stands out because it's basic us
electrical

116
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,099
and it lead to suffer munitions packing
sold on

117
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,550
its ok about the explosively palm
collects generator a typical

118
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,229
generator are like that its copper tube
and it's the armature

119
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:31,889
are the two it's filled with a fast high
order explosive such as BNC types

120
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,839
for you poor man James Bond fans there
and two blocks

121
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,279
earth PBX 9501 the armature its officer
and by

122
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,080
a kilcoin usually copper and it makes

123
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,580
Rd FCG stator and the stators winding

124
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,878
and some designs is actually segmented
with are

125
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,469
other wires bifurcating the incitements
to persisting

126
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:59,959
doctors on the coil so the strong forces
are made during down operation

127
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:03,129
could theoretically disintegrate the
device if not

128
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:07,830
kind of quickly so and it's usually done
by adding

129
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,370
some kind of jacket have something
that's non-magnetic materials with

130
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,839
fiberglass or concrete

131
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,930
in a matrix of a park Si want to carry
on in theory

132
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,539
its with the any proper mechanical or
electrical properties can be used

133
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,779
in areas where weight is an issue such
as

134
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,990
a missile warhead or millionaire
delivered bomb

135
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,659
Kevlar or glass epoxy composite could be
used as well

136
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:35,860
and you know it's typical are that
explosives going to that name won the

137
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,829
current peaks

138
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,300
and it's usually done worth explosive

139
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,839
ones plane wave generator which makes a
uniform plane wave burn

140
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:48,329
ordination and from the explosive after
that the wave

141
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:51,980
up the explosions of spread to the coil
actually

142
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,760
force me into a conical shape and her
between 12 to 14 degrees a park

143
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,529
where the armatures can be expanded 24
diameter of the coil South making short

144
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:03,260
circuit between the ends of the coil

145
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,680
during an isolating the star current
source

146
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,250
and trapping the current within the
hardware itself the spreading sure has

147
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,040
the effect

148
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,760
with iraq it'll tighten the magnetic
field and reducing tartan so the coil

149
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,630
so such centers like that'll make the
ramp in current polls

150
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,400
which will pick before disintegration
and

151
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,500
there's other results that show like the
ramp times and you know

152
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,770
word peaks in world dropping about the
ratio the output current south

153
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,779
our it's gained according to design in
there's

154
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,740
variance in a depending on who makes a
on numbers as high as 60 have been

155
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,720
seeing

156
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,730
and in other applications we're waiting
space are concerned the smallest

157
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,709
obviously is going to be the best in the
applications can

158
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,829
exploit the cascading at the McD's

159
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:54,949
where's the primer little actually be
the star

160
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:58,600
current and it's been backed up with
experiments are done it at various

161
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,750
national labs

162
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,899
Los Alamos being one of them so aren't
the main concerns and adjusting

163
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:07,970
anything I'll with in that for weapons
application

164
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,640
was actually the packaging because a
star Kurt supply

165
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,010
matching to the unit overextended load

166
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,279
in connecting to load is simply arts
just the collapse ya maturing

167
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,770
and the conical designs more importantly
are

168
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,180
it's available for weapons were cities
can be stacked axially

169
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,709
with devices such as a microwave
Mercator and don't need a buttload

170
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,199
are such as I'd in terms of timing in
waveform shape

171
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:39,040
can take care are answer in Transformers

172
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,740
for shipping networks another explosive
icon switches

173
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,209
so not to drive that you need some kind
of explosive

174
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,990
so the design for that arts are it since
was so driven

175
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,180
magneto 109 Amick I it's a younger form

176
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,760
up the FCG technical issues on which
weighs in the site

177
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,370
are the size of it again or concern

178
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,569
you know but it seems to be that to
image the devices themselves only play

179
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:09,420
a small role in to where this is going
to go in the future

180
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,279
me principle behind it is %uh Pixar the
conductor moving through magnetic field

181
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,000
will make an electrical current

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,970
opposite the direction up the field up
the conductor motion

183
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,939
so and propeller explosive driven device
like that the conductor is

184
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:27,370
as plasma by nice propellant gas and

185
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,459
at all force it through the magnetic
field in the current is

186
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:34,010
gathered by the electrodes which were in
contact with

187
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,970
that plasma string and the properties of
it

188
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,679
are pursues it when you see it
propellant with the proper additive II

189
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,250
nyse: during the burn

190
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,600
so experiments I have been done that
shows a number of propellant gases

191
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,689
using conventional ammunition for Palin
as a base

192
00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:54,819
cartridges on of such profound can be
loaded with regular too early rounds

193
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:58,670
for multiple shots so for a tactical 7

194
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,750
draw your own conclusions not a ver
cater itself

195
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,880
has some love the MCG's that are

196
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,220
opponent technology base artist know
obviously for it being so strong

197
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,529
and the output of itself up in space
physics is restricted to frequencies

198
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,390
below one megahertz

199
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,380
so many targets really difficult to hit
you know even with a high-powered

200
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,399
such frequencies so aiming the energy
from 9

201
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,250
it's gonna be a problem but the
high-power

202
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,480
device itself all taker both problems

203
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,480
because they're prepared to detail
condensed in all have our

204
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,589
a better believe it to take on both
energy into a tortoise

205
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:42,899
so then there's a number these are exist
you know again

206
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,240
to Google you'll see it slow wave
devices magnetron SRO to Vista

207
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,189
are close ron's your some names for

208
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:55,020
and I'll the Mercator itself is
interesting because it's only one shot

209
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,569
unit but it'll produce

210
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:00,219
you note the very strong powerful single
Paul's

211
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,260
but mechanically its very compact

212
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,029
so you can do all kinds of fun
applications whether

213
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:12,029
any compulsion over a number of
microwave frequencies as well

214
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,290
so %uh the physics behind itself it's a
lot more complex

215
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,050
but basically the for catered South
you're speeding current

216
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,600
through an electron beam against a
measure of some kind of oil and hold

217
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,069
ended or trans will pass through the
anode making a bubble space

218
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:33,940
animals put the charge behind the
current

219
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,069
notes on our you'll get a lot of the
electron so largely passed through it

220
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:42,600
you know and under the right conditions
it'll actually are making ass lead at

221
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,620
the monitor said a microwave frequencies
so the spaces itself is put into a

222
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,759
resonant cavity

223
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,319
which it's properly tuned very high peak
powers can be made

224
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:57,050
I and regular microbe engineering
techniques have been

225
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,930
shown at that it does work on

226
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,940
and as an aside to add to its no

227
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,040
that's not relevant that's to complex
for this

228
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,189
know at least in the Sun

229
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,730
but it'll go into with power levels
range from 170 kilowatts to over 40

230
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,769
gigawatts

231
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,639
over are numerous frequencies have
dismantled in the Sun Metro

232
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,190
bans on two most common configurations
of other for catered

233
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,699
in the axial Mercator ok on the EV in
the TV

234
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:34,480
the all the EV in its simplest

235
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,839
its at it's a wonder goal it's a
waveguide structure

236
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,930
and the powers extracted by changing the
way to go to a conical

237
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,370
porn which will function as the antenna

238
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,690
turn the navy's usually are Selena
transverse magnetic

239
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:54,160
RTM mode and a the transverse for cater
will inject the cathode current from the

240
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,649
side of a cavity

241
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:58,899
any loss leading in the transverse
electric mode

242
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,970
so are the concerns with that it's not
the design

243
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,689
its its output during post ERATION which
is usually the order in a microsecond

244
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:12,129
and its restricted are by the notes of
actually melting

245
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,350
disability love to frequency that it'll
%ah Selena

246
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,209
and butts compromise with a cavity most
common

247
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,569
conversion efficiently in and are the
power output

248
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:28,819
know the power efficiency from it it's
appropriate for selected antenna type:

249
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:32,170
and it can be a concern given the high
param levels

250
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,709
in potential for orchard breakdown in
and insulators

251
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:40,550
so the lethality ovett are its it's
pretty complex

252
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,279
unlike the regular technological base
for weapon construction

253
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,339
which you know for more reference and
others number

254
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,480
publicly me documents were under
lethality

255
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,769
now it's been reported much less
frequently

256
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:58,269
and the calculation of on the
electromagnetic field

257
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:01,779
its the strength servidor attainable at
certain radioing

258
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:06,829
for targets that's true for job
determining chill probability for target

259
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:11,069
isn't always sad excellent but there's
good reason behind us

260
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:14,360
that's because the targets were buried
in their durability you know if they're

261
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,319
shielded properly anything like that

262
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:20,899
when don't equipment that's been
protected are again see tackle twill

263
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,310
little taking I'm a number varieties

264
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,259
up the magnitude greater feel strengths
the standard of commercially rated

265
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:29,920
equipment

266
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,509
so more importantly various
manufacturers

267
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,620
issuing the summer types of equipment
can vary a lot in

268
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:41,420
hardness due to the variables a
neurological signs cabling systems

269
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,490
shielding designs Center

270
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,529
the second problem is and figuring out
lethality

271
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,620
up the company efficiency are which is a
measure how much Paris transferred

272
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,149
from the field made by the weapon into
the target

273
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,329
so only power coupled into the target
can do damage

274
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:04,120
were any useful damage are sold know
when get the coupling modes

275
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,310
and Howard Archer goes into the target
stores to principles behind it

276
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,349
tures a front door coupling dont are
usually happen when power from

277
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,908
from EMP sort of its couple into the
interna-

278
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,720
associated with the communications are
radar outside

279
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,159
and the antenna is designed the couple
power in an outer the equipment

280
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:27,740
and provides a good path for the power
flow are from the weapon

281
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,389
and thats would be good but damage now
back to our coupling happens

282
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:37,010
when the electromagnetic fields from a
weapon makes large transient currents

283
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,740
are better known as spikes when made by
low-frequency

284
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,929
are or logical standing waves are made
by

285
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,419
high-power device like them were a fixed
wiring cables

286
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:53,889
providing connection so mean power or
telephone network

287
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,100
so couldn't connected to anything expose
will experience

288
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,409
on the transient spikes or standing
waves which can

289
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:05,659
damage to power supplies in if they're
not guarded properly

290
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:10,320
sold on low-frequency weapon on a couple
well into regular wiring

291
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,450
are due to the fact the most phone lines
data lines in a loud

292
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,000
building corridors apartment buildings
notes it's all exposed

293
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,440
so in most cases are any particular
cable

294
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,010
little gonna leave everything open are
cuz its joint approximate right angles

295
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,429
Nonso whatever the road a
familiarization up the weapons

296
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:34,040
field more than one 1-year segment of
the cable run itself

297
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,908
it's gonna be oriented in such a way
that good coupling can be gone

298
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,190
know it's also worth noting on the safe
operation

299
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,690
envelopes have some common types the
semiconductor devices

300
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,470
because the breakdown ratings offer
silicon high-frequency bipolar

301
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,760
transients

302
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,500
are two finals most often in your radio
transmitters things like that

303
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,510
will vary between 15 65 balls

304
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,879
so arm the gallium arsenide feel effect
transistors are usually rated between

305
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:07,190
Turnbull's so the high-density de RAM

306
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,240
is essential for many computers and it's
ready to serve in bowls

307
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,300
generic CMOS logic has a rating

308
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,129
between seven and 15 balls
microprocessors running of a 3.3 or 50

309
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:20,690
power supply

310
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,760
are is related closely voltage

311
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,300
and modern device or equipment worth

312
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,710
added circuits to each pin sank and

313
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,000
the start discharge and study employment
behind

314
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,500
voltage will get past that so
communications interfaces

315
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,030
power supplies that has to meet some
kind of standard requirements

316
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,820
in interface is right that are usually
protected by isolation transformers or

317
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,189
have a rating from

318
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,340
hundreds evolves to about two or three
couples so it's obvious I once defense

319
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,399
is made available by a transformer

320
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:59,300
a cable polls arrest or shielding is
bypassed a voltage is low as 50 volts

321
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,330
can do more damage to the equipment

322
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,240
so hyper magnetic weapons functioning in
that sauna metric

323
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,720
bans another here on the other hand to
an additional couple process to back to

324
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,909
work up on

325
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:14,600
and that's the ability to couple
directly into the equipment through

326
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,030
ventilation holes

327
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,330
space between panels and poorly guarded
interfaces

328
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,689
and the situations anything going into
the equipment is going to act like a

329
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:23,320
slut

330
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,149
in the microwave cavity leading more
microwave radiation into the center

331
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:33,800
about camping relations conform special
standing wave pattern

332
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,850
on the components in the in Tinos within
the standing wave

333
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,220
or openly hi want to midnight feels

334
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,590
to the fact that so many microwave
weapons can couple easier than low

335
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,850
frequency

336
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,950
weapons and in many cases around safety
devices double

337
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,200
stopped the race is on you know me to
stop in at

338
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,020
the microwave weapons do have the
ability to be much more lethal

339
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,990
the low-frequency weapons research has
been done zairian shows

340
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,409
difficult in producing a workable model
for guessing equipment vulnerability

341
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:09,059
but it does show a solid model for
protective equipment

342
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:13,399
the variety of a likely target in the
unknown geometrical layout

343
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:16,619
in the logical details wiring and
cabling infrastructure

344
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:19,720
surrounding it wild you know makes

345
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,679
exact prediction impossible but there
have been formed was drawn up for it

346
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,190
so basic approach dealing with it you
know this relating

347
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,770
are to back to work up on is to figure
out nonlethal voltage levels

348
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,440
and then uses to find out the needed
films strength to generate voltage

349
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,000
and once thats figured out lethal radius
forgiven weapon configuration to be made

350
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,790
so 100 sample then on is our

351
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,720
its arts hour from 10 gigs 25 gigahertz

352
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,169
high power device showing the footprint
a 400 to 500 meters in diameter

353
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:58,800
to distance or a few hundred meters and
others on field strengths

354
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,929
some kilobits per meter win footprint
and it's a beloved making

355
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:06,570
hundreds votes articles on exposed wires
and cables

356
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,428
and that hints at least radio hundreds
of meters depending on weapons performs

357
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,200
and hurts the fans

358
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,929
so to Max Mosley family first thing to
do

359
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:20,860
is to top out at the peak power in
duration of the radius of the weapon

360
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,049
so for certain bomb size is done by
using the most powerful flux compression

361
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:25,100
generator

362
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,210
and the Mercator in an HP and palm
which'll

363
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,870
obviously for the size and energy not
permitted is wasted energy

364
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,440
as a constantly psychology with our

365
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,159
Nexus maximizing coupling efficiency to
the target set in a good way to deal

366
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:39,669
with

367
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:44,179
a complex and very targeted its are just
use every chance a couple available

368
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:47,789
in the weapons ban was

369
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:51,390
low-frequency bomb built around enough
CG

370
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:54,799
will need a big antenna to supply the
power coupling to the surrounding

371
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,320
environment

372
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,039
number one weapons me this way are
inherently wideband

373
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,299
since muscle power produced made in it
is

374
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:07,360
below one megahertz miss Montana sus
aren't an option for about

375
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,600
one possibilities for upon getting close
to its firing altitude is an 05 lanier

376
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,750
in Tower

377
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,880
internet elements and it's done by
injecting schools have cable which one

378
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,260
one hundred meters in length

379
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,610
also for radio antennas over 40 and

380
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:26,370
Virtual Earth plane surrounding the bomb
itself

381
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,399
on actual element can create the power
formerly a teacher

382
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:34,409
so the suction of the element once I
would be needed to properly match the

383
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:35,700
frequency

384
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,470
and make the proper field a high-power
is needed to match

385
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,299
the low impedance overseas your output
our minutes

386
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:46,870
because the higher pins antenna making
sure the current doesn't pose

387
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,390
you can fry the cable early it's not
time to write

388
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,260
I know there are torn other alternatives
about once a just God the bomb close to

389
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,730
the target self

390
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:02,049
in count 1 than talent a near-field made
by the FCG winding

391
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,279
which is just a loop internal with a
small diameter related

392
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,279
to though the ban was so coupling I
isn't the best to use the bomb

393
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,370
and that is guided would like more
accurate hit be made

394
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,659
sown area worth looking into further in
the sense that are

innocence the fields your Flex generator

397
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:28,380
or the type I'll you know that that's

398
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,549
whatever for concealed damage my critics
on

399
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:34,649
I'm not sure the exact frequencies
either

400
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:37,770

themselves have wider range of our

there's the reflector the actual over
cater that have mentioned before

410
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,710
the internal reports heard are

00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,460
pseudo back for a reflector Bowl not if
you earlier

412
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,640
the whole Hilton was some way and the

416
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,070
ministers are so many things on our

417
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,330
to be used and I don't mean always in a
military science

and other targets

422
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:02,220
are you know in it's also good are
because its geographically fixed

423
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,450
and so you know it's gonna make air
attack

424
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,740
not the best way to do it so the
accuracy for it now

425
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,740
it's programmed because the GPS to and

426
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,290
it's camouflaged in the mobile targets
well

427
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,559
dunno radiate openly so

428
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,710
relocatable mobile air defenses our
mobile communication nodes

429

naval vessels and they're all examples a
certain targets

430
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,790
when radiating their positions can be
tracked with a suitable or trying to

yes am all.com arm and

433
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,500
the OAS a mirror locating systems there
are carried

434
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,850
either by the launch platform or remote

435
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,400
with on the aforementioned surveillance
platform

436
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,990
the target coordinates are constantly
went to the launch platform

437
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,840
muscle targets like to move pretty slow
when you're not able to get outta

438
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,320
how to fund the in peace footprint I'm
so hidden

439
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,770
are targets mobile targets which won't
openly radiate

440
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,700
on can be a problem especially if
regular means that are going are being

441
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,320
used

442
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,399
so certain solution to us

443
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,100
as finding and tracking a unintentional
a mission

444
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,179
UE mccollum and that's gained

445
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:17,320
most attention in a sense of tempest
surveillance of all things

446
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,260
were roaming admonitions I we can
properly shielded equipment can be

447
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,440
spotted

448
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,679
many cases can be de Margerie together
useful I'll

449
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,720
piece of information out a bit are

450
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,600
and it's called van Acker radiation so
if you're familiar with panic freaking

451
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,900
you also do you know what I'm talking
about in such missions like that can be

452
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,330
guess

453
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,610
out they can be best capetown with
proper home

454
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,640
controls in third there are our control
techniques

455
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,150
will show another transparency about
that in a bit so

456
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,230
the modulating on the whole ewing it's
difficult

457
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,210
not to take care then targeting of the
MP bombs because it doesn't present the

458
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,179
problem so targeting

459
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:02,650
in a mirror for an attack it needs only
to determine the type of mission

460
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:06,470
TargetType in isolate its position and
that's because the fact that the

461
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,080
computer monitor emissions peripherals
and any processing equipment switch

462
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,699
modes

463
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,790
on internal combustion systems duty
cycle

464
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,980
controllers arm fire research
france-based

465
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,020
heterodyne receivers things like that
and they all have their own frequencies

466
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
modulations

467
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,090
just you know it makes it so much easier
it's not just a block

468
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:31,870
frequencies a look at everyone can pick
bout and don't was

469
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,830
sounds like during the vietnam war in
fact I always use one gunships

470
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,370
when out at nine in the ring using
direction are finding receivers

471
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:42,840
to find emissions from vehicle and make
mission missions and once

472
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,700
found the vehicle would be attacked so

473
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,780
no UE happens on a pretty low level and
the use a

474
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,250
method for detection before any
incidence

475
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,309
can be difficult to use because it might
be news actually fly over the target

476
00:28:58,309 --> 00:28:59,010
itself

477
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,730
in star are time when for frequencies so
the use of drones

478
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:09,210
are going to be used more in a no
actually getting the bomb there

479
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:14,250
its summer to regular explosive warhead
and it's Phil to certain amount space

480
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,260
in it has given mass a term in buying
whatever hardware they're using inside a

481
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:18,510
bit

482
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,050
and things a single point so there now

483
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,710
no I'm sure there's there's probably
more the had this because

484
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,409
the info I have its couple years old but

485
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:33,070
it involves are filling were head to a
cruise missiles airframe

486
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:37,439
but the frame itself is going to
restrict the weapons way to about 750

487
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,070
pounds

488
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,149
or 340 children's for European firms

489
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:47,120
and some restrictions in fuel capacity
could see the size increased

490
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,490
so research involving uses is the need
to carry a

491
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,370
a power supply given to the current to
church the capacitors are used

492
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,280
to prime the FCG before actually goes
off

493
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,360
so the payload will then be balance
between storage the weapon itself

494
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,110
and the weapon like the cruise missile
the size

495
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,510
other from current source as well as a
battering

496
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,950
can impose a restriction on weapons
ability

497
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,970
because they're delivered bombs having a
flight time

498
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:19,960
tens of seconds to minutes to be built
to boost the launching aircraft power

499
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,390
systems

500
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,740
and such a design the bombs capacitor

501
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,659
been can be powered up by the aircraft
on its way to the target

502
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:32,140
and after release a smaller on for power
supply can take over innkeeper

503
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,110
church-going

504
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:39,030
at a certain level Sony MP bomb
delivered by regular aircraft

505
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,408
other offer better ratio of not would
have total

506
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:48,880
annihilation some cases because the
massive it can be committed

507
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,290
to an EMP device installation itself

508
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,190
so if that's the case a given technology
for EMP bomb

509
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,450
over identical mass to enlarge from
magnetic equipment

510
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,640
or electromagnetic acquit missile can be
more lethal and consume greater accuracy

511
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,470
delivery are and technologically
somewhere electromagnetic devices I'm

512
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,270
so a missile with an archer magnetic
warhead insulation

513
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:20,620
will make up the EMT device an energy
converter and an on-board storage unit

514
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,049
like a battery are obviously needed and
as a weapons charge the battery is

515
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,000
drained

516
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,370
so the electromagnetic device will be
off by the missiles on board fusing

517
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,309
system

518
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:34,280
and in be connected to the navigation
system in the cruise missile

519
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,809
an anti shipping missile I'll its

520
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:41,490
are nor should he is determined to ship
but it's meant for any naval

521
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,820
craft are the radar seeker

522
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,600
and in anything that's air-to-air
missile as their proximity fusing system

523
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,880
in the ratio of payload mas to launch
mass

524
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,299
is unreal between 15 to 30 percent

525
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:01,190
Sony MP bombs were head to make up and
watch a magnetic device

526
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,850
in energy converter and Obama church the
whole device after leaving the platform

527
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,990
are the fusing to be furnished by radar
altimeter

528
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,929
fuse to detonate the bomb in the air
their metrics use

529
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:18,159
or in some cases even GPS guided bombs
the systems navigation

530
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,240
the warhead ratio can be as high as
eighty-five percent with most the good

531
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,210
man is being occupied by the Orchha
magnetic device

532
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,429
and supporting hardware so because of
the large

533
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,870
potentially lethal radius other device

534
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:36,210
are you know know it's

535
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,590
moment when we see her

536
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,350
aka think it has to be flying a in
relation to an explosive device for the

537
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,230
summer mastin of delivery would be
better

538
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,500
this is an inherent characteristic of
the weapons like a cruise missile

539
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,730
but possibly on the use of that was for
guided bombs

540
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,730
anything else ever dare missiles it's
going to take

541
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,820
Fire Inferno and forget guidance up the
rate variety 2002 watching aircraft get

542
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,000
a good distance

543
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,360
a few miles before that nation

544
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,740
so GPS guidance for weapons has meant

545
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,870
good joins for low-cost all the GPS
weapons

546
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,140
without a differential GPS add-on

547
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:24,809
are it may not have done on accuracy but
they're accurate to within forty feet

548
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:28,240
so in recent years the air force's done
number of things with it

549
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,200
on an important so that means that as a
former delivery for

550
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,050
others three benefits the first being
that the guy bond to be let go from

551
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:36,840
outside

552
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,820
effective radius reducing risk to the
aircraft

553
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,639
second on tort standoff means that the
aircraft to be well aware

554
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:48,320
well well away from the effects of the
bombs and third

555
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,189
the bombs on a pilot can be programmed
to from the term ultrastructure of the

556
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,120
weapon

557
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,370
so target can be engaged from better
angle

558
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:00,560
and the big adventure museum P bombs
that they can be delivered by any

559
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,178
tactical aircraft

560
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:05,480
with the Nava tax system that's it that
has to pierce

561
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,300
equipment so if weapon blitzer
properties are the same to a standard

562
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,030
weapon

563
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,379
no software changes need to be made onto
the EP bombs and it's simple in

564
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:15,750
comparison weapons like

565
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,418
arm anti radiation munitions

566
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:23,129
notes due to low cost manufacturing
support

567
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:26,460
and I can be expected that there's going
to be greater number of these

568
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,750
used in the future so in that sense it's
worth being aware of their first

569
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,929
possession of the JDM capable

570
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,510
F one seventeen a newbie to weigh any
ability to deliver the EMP bombs against

571
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:44,510
high-profile targets

572
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:55,690
so defensive measures

573
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,099
there

574
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,019
so on if if you have seen mom movie
enemy the state

575
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,539
word they made reference to copper
shielding being inside the walls that

576
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,039
was a

577
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:16,039
a takeoff on this mother isn't so and
our when I'm done

578
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:20,259
and if you wanna come up and take a look
at this its that's fine

579
00:35:20,259 --> 00:35:24,109
us on though the limitations of the
weapons

580
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:28,390
arts the front by the usage I in it it
does restrict accuracy

581
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,828
but what can best use a two-story sulci
computers in the receivers

582
00:35:32,829 --> 00:35:37,739
will cause little or no damage I had
such as anything that's cold war

583
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,269
russian military equipment anything from
when germany was born have Center

584
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:45,999
so the points are limiting the radiation

585
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:49,079
it's difficult YouTube to determine the
course assessment

586
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,160
because are readying targets like radar
communications equipment

587
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,348
can continue to radiate after an attack
even after their data processing systems

588
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:58,089
have been killed

589
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:01,109
so it means that some equipment might
can

590
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:04,279
may be able to still suffering attacking
continue working

591
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:08,029
on the flip side a bad any matters

592
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:11,219
better shut down before it out may not
show damage right away

593
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:15,440
so and I've also got another
transparency her

594
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,380
for what this is

595
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,130
arm it's a strategic airtight model so

596
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,509
want one of these are delivered mendota
should eras

597
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:31,759
anyway on now so

598
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:36,229
you wanna go for the leadership done the
computer networks for San already out

599
00:36:36,229 --> 00:36:37,119
machinery

600
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,509
arm thrilling signals for railroads

601
00:36:40,509 --> 00:36:44,609
cumbia skiing what because once a
leadership sticking out there anything

602
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:45,038
else

603
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,440
just go right much known right away
eventual

604
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,420
and ultimately will go down to the field
troops furthered even just simple

605
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,009
two areas so

606
00:36:56,009 --> 00:37:00,039
no no big brother has been really
talking with us

607
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,349
so you might wanna taken no on this and
look it up later

608
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:06,739
but there are a number of executive
orders

609
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:09,789
that were signed on while ago

610
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:13,779
are and it was combined into executive
order

611
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:16,979
11 004

612
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:21,099
art at sorts party but I another provide
for the housing finance

613
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:24,539
authority to relocate communities and
designate areas

614
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:29,539
so if let's say government were to have
been since people

615
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:34,289
and want to make sure they were staying
out other wanna for everything they own

616
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:37,900
and all that was also combined into
another

617
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,180
our executive order that Richard Nixon
signed into our

618
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,308
you know even now you know all this are
aware of the problems

619
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:50,499
they're coming down the road and this is
one I just I just came across a wanna

620
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:51,640
point out because

621
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,739
it does put the whole hacker community
at risk we stand to lose everything

622
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:59,349
so

623
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:04,549
here's surgery ok

624
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:09,739
I'm on the say something first then the
we have tommy is going to talk about

625
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:12,940
are her pottery but I decided to come
early now

626
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,210
because on leo's Gonzo's

627
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,829
material deals with anti infrastructure
weaponry

628
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:24,539
over obviously since it's not directed
against personal

629
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:29,119
its not directly legal though if you
destroy the life support systems

630
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,880
such as agriculture transportation

631
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,979
power and communications things of that
sort

632
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:39,059
eventually it will lead to casualties
however

633
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:42,670
are but now when I'm gonna talk about is
non-lethal

634
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:48,130
anti-personnel technology not just the
kind that can be used during

635
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,930
warfare but also someone policing

636
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,839
lot of times police when I get there
suspect without

637
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:00,319
damaging without hurting them in any way
or killing him

638
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:03,960
s me be the case in some unfortunate
situations

639
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,660
now when the most interesting devices
that have come across

640
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,210
is a tetanus ray developed by a company

641
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,859
called hosp technologies they have a
website

642
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:20,069
at HS bTW organ case anyone wants to
check it out

643
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:25,299
also your pet number later but first I
like to mention the predecessors

644
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:28,599
over this technology which

645
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:33,539
are actually being also present develop
their thing paralegal

646
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,509
the being developed in parallel to this
technology

647
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,579
and there're the manifestations

648
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:44,329
is a technology in case anyone does not
know that is animals

649
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:47,690
just cranking up with a high voltage
current

650
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,509
a high-voltage low average current
through a human

651
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:55,259
body which and basically two stones the
human being

652
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:59,589
or animal as its use on cattle some
cases

653
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:03,380
on the Air Force and I believe the army
have developed

654
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,079
vehicle mounted teasers tasers which
could be used against

655
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,109
mass group

656
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:13,808
or focus on individual being and the
utilized to

657
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:19,339
ultraviolet lasers 2i nyse:t oxygen
molecules in the air

658
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:22,509
a it it takes three up bolt-ons

659
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:25,549
to is basically etc when you

660
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:28,579
pulls a Lesar oxygen

661
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:31,900
the action annum omits a

662
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,049
loses and electron that's becoming a
positive on

663
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:38,460
making the this making the nice

664
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,849
I on the channel for the electric
current to go through

665
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:47,380
so nurse to ultraviolet lasers which
create a conductive circuit

666
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,190
one going from the teaser one book
coming back to the teaser

667
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,489
which allows the operator other device
to actually just shoot out

668
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:59,630
electric current without the need of
wires which are used in the eighties in

669
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,059
which either has a

670
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:04,400
gun powder charge or air a compressed

671
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,469
common axis charge shootout to lecture

672
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:10,829
electron electric prongs and thus

673
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:14,549
a stone the subject this instead

674
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:17,619
uses its it's kinda like this I fire a
gun

675
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:22,199
edge issued South to raise a ultraviolet
radiation point at the target

676
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,299
that I night as the oxygen that it

677
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:29,538
shoots a then I'm use the conductive
paths

678
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:33,619
to shoot the current through their and
basically a

679
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:38,499
hat has a teaser fact on the people the
new technology the turn is a shin

680
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:43,380
is a very into that that uses modulate
current

681
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,420
a I don't know I'm still

682
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,759
not able to find the proper frequency
such thing that is also proprietor

683
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:51,989
information whole room

684
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:57,219
working on it are in my own little ways

685
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:01,539
the it that uses

686
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:04,880
modulated current to similarly a
electrical impulse is used by the

687
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,339
nervous system

688
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:10,900
to create an Ising affecting for those
who don't know Upton is Asian basically

689
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,309
is it's the SATs stimulation muscle
tissue

690
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:18,660
at a frequency which mergers the
individual muscle contractions

691
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,729
and 21 a single

692
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:26,109
up sustained contraction so on

693
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:29,259
muscles when they get logical impulse is

694
00:42:29,259 --> 00:42:33,749
between the nerve impulse is the time to
relax attend Mass Effect

695
00:42:33,749 --> 00:42:39,140
a it does not allow the most relaxing
just keeps the muscle clenched up

696
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,920
and with this ray the person affected by
the Sri would not

697
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,339
feel any pain if the race much later
properly

698
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:51,440
though just frees up and if they're when
they're standing at the body was

699
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,069
balanced that would not fall down there
only for down

700
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:57,089
those used against them running

701
00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:00,759
at the running or just off balance in
any way

702
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:05,019
no some might wonder if for example this
might be harmful to the

703
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:08,170
on is because it's ultraviolet laser
just

704
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,430
shooting at you however its not a

705
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,489
shot at its and at a

706
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:18,390
such hi I am putting so it's the damage
the right now

707
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:22,049
and damage to the skin is almost
non-existent

708
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:25,640
since or does it its ionized air what it
has the skin

709
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,769
its prima Thomas it's just like going to
a tanning bed

710
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:34,109
unlike there but from much briefer
natural

711
00:43:34,109 --> 00:43:37,449
there's also the lasers themselves can
be modulated

712
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:41,920
a depending on the range so for maximum
range which could be two kilometers he

713
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,769
would use a frequency over

714
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:47,749
you would use a wavelength up towards
money then leaders

715
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:51,400
so that extends the range to up to

716
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,749
two kilometers the small strangers or is

717
00:43:54,749 --> 00:44:01,039
the when using the waiver 193 kilometers
the fuck the Rangers 100 meters

718
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,140
on for those of you who have a pen or
pencil I can give you the patent number:

719
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,449
seeking those two are the nazis Patent
Office website and just get the entire

720
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:14,869
text that and diagrams the patent the
Patent Office website is www dot

721
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:18,150
you s PTO dot gov slashed

722
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,699
p eighty FC and the pet numbers

723
00:44:21,699 --> 00:44:25,219
be there again or its you you

724
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:29,079
as you US PT old dot gov

725
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:32,410
science PA TFT

726
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,779
and the patent number: is 5 6

727
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:40,079
7 5 one 03

728
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,329
there was a shootout on October 7 1997
so

729
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:46,579
this is relatively need technology

730
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:50,480
I S 5 6 75

731
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,119
one 03 it's pretty all it's a
seven-year-old

732
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,269
patent comments it's been actually paid
for before that

733
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:02,269
but or thats not really relevant in this
case

734
00:45:02,269 --> 00:45:05,940
on is the make this brief I have another
devices were

735
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,349
I wanna talk about it's not the vice in
and of itself as much than the fact

736
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:13,589
up in for sound and not gonna go into

737
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:16,839
or rather technical details as

738
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,489
for Sun is basically any

739
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:24,079
noise that whose frequency is the Lowell

740
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,329
that OVA 20 hurts

741
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:31,730
though most people only see when they
see in for sound the utilize

742
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,119
things up to for example a size maybe a
a hundred

743
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,039
hurts the scientifically that's not
considered for sound

744
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:45,910
I still merger with a group in for Sonos
use naturally by animals

745
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,940
mainly mammals like Wales and

746
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,859
Tigers elephants to stunned and shocked
pray

747
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:56,410
or elephants for example use it as a
defensive measure

748
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,999
and also to communicate since are in for
sound

749
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:03,420
travels quite for and it tends to hug
the ground

750
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,400
source good it's very good for
communications and

751
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,410
since it's not it's very hard to stop

752
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,239
as we all know if you have someone in
the party blasting

753
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:17,420
music above you the first thing you
here's the base

754
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:21,349
that tends to penetrate more than
anything else said lower the sound

755
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:26,239
the better the penetration but there are
legal frequencies which at a certain

756
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:27,239
decibel rate

757
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:30,940
can kill and those tend to be around the
seven hurts range

758
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,849
327 hurts mom

759
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:39,699
if you do though harder if is that for
short amount of time cam uses non-lethal

760
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:40,880
weapons or just make

761
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,989
the subject on the more

762
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:47,349
rather set however the

763
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:50,509
negative affect using these weapons is
that you

764
00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:54,289
can't exactly focuses too well and it
has to travel back

765
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:58,380
onto the users so the best to utilize it

766
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,859
is remote as a remote technology which

767
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:05,859
