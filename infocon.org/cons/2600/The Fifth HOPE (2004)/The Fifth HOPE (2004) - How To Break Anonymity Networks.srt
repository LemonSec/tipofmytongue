1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,229
hi

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,550
arm mister talking now arm

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,809
my name is Nick matthewson and I even

4
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:17,330
for those few who just saw a lens talk
about

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,369
when in new systems are arm what they
have been and what they're becoming

6
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:26,359
I'm going to talk about how to break
them now why am I talking about this

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,830
given that I spend most my time trying
to make them keeping

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,580
I'm working largely because the people
who are trying to break them

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,690
now don't are

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,239
the circle people who attend these
conferences who learn how to break

11
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,079
things

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,969
maybe you now playing innocent prank or
two with the things they've broken

13
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,950
then tell everyone else how to do it so
that's whatever problems they're working

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,690
to get text

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,449
their people who are very selfish with
their knowledge ends

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,280
June if there is things like track down
human rights activists

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,859
and other things the just don't make my
job making these things secure

18
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:04,940
simpler so I'm hoping that by getting
people interested in this topic

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll get people who will help your
interest did

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,420
in the topic arm as one said I'm
involved with the mix million

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,080
type 3 project and I'm also one other
developers on tor

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,350
The Onion Router so arm I'll

23
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,920
I'm going to talk to you a little bit
about attacks though I know and

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,049
I'll take questions at the end I'm gonna
start I'll

25
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:30,210
by talk to you a little bit about enemy
networks most the

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,470
is going to be stuff the uncovered saw
gloss over pretty fast

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:38,100
arm not talk about some attacks that
should be dead long ago cuz we've known

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,310
her defeat most to them

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,140
since David Chan wrote his first Knicks
nets paper in 1981

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,149
but because there's a sort of

31
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:49,649
really regrettable divide between the
hacker community

32
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,149
which is full of geniuses and the
research community which is full

33
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:54,119
geniuses

34
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,170
and both of whom are convinced that the
other side has nothing to teach them

35
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,380
that arm its really only recently that

36
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,149
peoples are going to each other's
conferences arm not talk about

37
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,199
traffic Nelson mister roberts. talking
about the herd version

38
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,390
which I call traffic analysis for telcos
or

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,360
it also works well as traffic analysis
for this lovable gentleman

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,819
glaring at you from behind me are then
I'll talk about ways

41
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,530
be these attacks are gonna be a little
outsider the price range many %uh view

42
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,580
unless you happen to work for
three-letter government agencies

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,650
you know who you are and you know who
you are on tape

44
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,239
arm but I'll talk about ways you can
simplify them

45
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,640
speed them up and try to collect more
data

46
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,530
more usable be faster in order to
attacked those pesky people revealing

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,379
the secrets of your UFO cult

48
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:48,599
then I'll talk about outside the box
stuff because

49
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,160
traffic analysis is really attacking an
enemy now works at their strongest point

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,790
they're designed to be traffic analysis
resistance why do things the hard way

51
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,840
friendly I'll talk about how we think we
might defend against some of these

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,379
things

53
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,768
and which of these things we've got no
clue how to beat pope

54
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,050
hopefully it's just the hard ones we
don't know how to be but see whether you

55
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,849
believe me or not

56
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:14,500
I'm not gonna talk about steganographic
systems

57
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,700
that is systems that would hide not only
what you're saying

58
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,780
botch the fact that you're using the
system at all

59
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,250
not only for your saying stuff too but
doctors insist middle

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,110
I'm not going to talk about supposedly
systems they're supposed to give you

61
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,489
plausible deniability only that is

62
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:35,840
everyone knows it's you but they can't
prove it I'm not going to talk about

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,049
snake-oil enemy systems that are based
on wishful thinking that is

64
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,519
I didn't write my name on it so it's
anonymous no one's gonna

65
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,670
gonna bother to fingerprint me so

66
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:52,090
I'm anonymous no one was looking at that
open proxy I used to send a mail

67
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,410
so I'm probably gonna miss

68
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,549
so how the enemy networks work well

69
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,330
arm how many people were not lens talk
arm

70
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,920
okay a good number so call cover this
from a black bar

71
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,780
point of view there's a buncha people
called Alice

72
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,040
and they wanna send messages to people
or

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,589
use website or whatever al call those
people are sending to you or the webb

74
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,859
says they're using Bob

75
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,930
and they want this picture

76
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,640
to be the only picture that you the
attacker can see

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,000
your easy okay bunch else's maybe
there's ten thousands to the five

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,260
arson text messages and a buncha bob's

79
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,530
leaders 10,000 stuff for are getting
messages

80
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,100
and I don't know who with alice is
sending to which bob

81
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,280
ands what am I gonna do

82
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,850
so how does this work you've got

83
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,870
a bunch of servers the make up the
network

84
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,470
each Alice when she's gonna send a
message to a chosen Bob

85
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,320
chooses a path through the servers on
the network there's way more servers and

86
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,070
that the paths

87
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,590
longer the connections are more
complicated there's more messages

88
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,210
this is a simplification and be jealous

89
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,260
after she picks for have a server's

90
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,440
takes her message and does a layered
encryption

91
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,820
with the public he's above the servers

92
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,390
along her path she tells each one in the
public key encryption part of it

93
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,000
which server use next so the first
server

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,169
says I got a message from Alice arm

95
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,830
unwraps a public key crypto says okay
i'm suppose the senders to server

96
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,150
99 and it holds onto a for a little
while to hide it I'm in connection

97
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,310
and every orders it with a bunch of
other messages from other alice is

98
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,770
and other servers the sons of the server
99

99
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,840
sir 909 gets it unwraps another layer
says I was going to surf reef or

100
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,270
and so on and so on until the last ones
as others going to bob 12

101
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,919
& Sons a 2-1 in the bobs ans

102
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,430
arm if this whole works

103
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,080
then all of the alice is are

104
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,870
plausible senders for any given message
the ghost any bob

105
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,580
now suppose we're taking the sting

106
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,870
what might we want to do because there's
not only different ackerson terms with

107
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,890
the capabilities are they have different
goals as well

108
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,150
we might wanna know who wrote this nasty
message

109
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,290
criticizing my country's government

110
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,450
we might might wanna know did the same
person

111
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,599
rate these two messages we might wanna
know

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,680
who's talking to some particular Alice

113
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,110
that we think is up to no good that we
watched you

114
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,000
catch was something embarrassing so we
can blackmail her we might just be

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,610
really

116
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,240
snoopy no nosy people wanna know who's
talking with whom in general because we

117
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,140
like to keep an eye out

118
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,200
on things we may have no interest in
who's talking to who are you saying what

119
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,530
but we just what the people who say
things we don't like to shut up I and

120
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,770
you know for what people that's

121
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,919
but they're out to do arm one

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,810
possible access along which a technical
some very is

123
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,130
we try to fighting so is you want
probability or certainty how much

124
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,680
certainty

125
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,760
you need arm do you need to know

126
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,550
who did it you know with scientific
certainty or are you okay

127
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,720
same old why those three guys over there
all suitable

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,480
arm are you bound by rules of evidence

129
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,810
if you're the FBI Annes assuming for the
moment the Constitution applies

130
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,100
assuming arm

131
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:42,250
then you can't just go do illegal
wiretaps on people for no good reason

132
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,800
you need to get permission before you go
snooping on people

133
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,970
so useful reserves on the other hand if
your intelligence agency you can get

134
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,300
away with a lot more

135
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,870
so one sorry talked about this a little
bit

136
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,000
I would be breaking my top my talk into
a tax on

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,720
the two major flavors love anonymity
networks

138
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,730
because the threat models against them
are very different there's Hylian CEMEX

139
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,430
nets

140
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,090
originally proposed by David charm in
nineteen eighty

141
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:18,100
one then redone later by the developers
are the cyberpunk or type 1 re mailer

142
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,820
arm improved by Mixmaster

143
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,070
lenders mix minion arm which is still an

144
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,730
alpha beta or al fayed a as an attendee
at the previous talk

145
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,920
called it arm be able which is the

146
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,300
designed it was built but never really
deployed and lots of other really

147
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,120
nifty things you three papers but nobody
ever built purple three papers about

148
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,200
these things messages go in

149
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,130
and they take anywhere from half an hour
to a couple hours to come out depending

150
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,350
on lot of things

151
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,960
and because of that they can hide the
connection between incoming and outgoing

152
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,950
messages better

153
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,570
but they're not really suitable for
playing quake with your friends

154
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,910
on bless you like week by mail

155
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,500
arm then they're a little agency
networks like freedom

156
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,810
me freedom never die it's dead

157
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,120
toward the Onion Router the javan on
proxy also known as job

158
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,210
arm by some folks at University Dresden
in Germany

159
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,200
ions many other systems that have been
proposed

160
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,970
some bills some not so not historical
attacks which

161
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,600
are which are I call but historical
quotes that should be historical

162
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,900
but people still use the stuff against
the cyber puppy millers one's talked

163
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,800
some about this but he's promised I
would talk more about it so I will

164
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,330
arm when these things is replay attacks

165
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,540
cyberpunk messages don't secretary
Miller's don't check to see whether

166
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,770
they've seen the same message before
necessarily

167
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,939
so if you if ellison's message you wanna
see

168
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,190
say who's that message going to if your
attacker with

169
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,800
are who can you know mess with

170
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,130
packets on a buyer who can even use yup
you take a message

171
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,320
and use in that same message fifty times
and you see who gets fifty copies of the

172
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,110
same message

173
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,910
that person is probably the recipient
and you can do some were tax if you can

174
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:08,620
get ahold

175
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,960
all one else has replied blocks which is
a

176
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,150
arm basically any truth to power

177
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,319
to get messages back to Alice without
knowing who else is

178
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,450
is also size correlation attacks arm

179
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,470
there are some countermeasures against
arm

180
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,950
replay text implemented in cyberpunk but
not also for Punk

181
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,820
remote support them and they don't
really work up so

182
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,280
look at this as a size correlation
attacks you might notice that

183
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,740
you know say this wasn't a megabyte
message went into this

184
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,750
re Miller a twenty k message wanted this
remember

185
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,080
are you one make minus a couple bites
came out

186
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,820
a 20k my circle bites came out probably

187
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,570
those you can tell that the one that
goes with the one make 28k go to the 20k

188
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,630
another thing about cyberpunk is it has
lots of features

189
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,709
and uses pgp as its encrypted format

190
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:11,200
MPTP has lotsa features now feature
sound good except you realize that we

191
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,720
are a wonderful day for

192
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,760
species and his wonderful diverse people

193
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,020
we make lots of different decisions and
decisions I love incisions you love me

194
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,540
that

195
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,670
we look different so we're providing
cover for each other's works against us

196
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,630
so did many versions a PGP and you know
and what we're trying to hide each other

197
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,420
in the system

198
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,800
or or trying to look like the same Alice
the fact that you're using PGP

199
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,100
version 2 and I'm using PGP version 6

200
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,180
and or you like arm

201
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,890
triple Dez for your site for our essay

202
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,470
0 know the Reno shitty you were trouble
does

203
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,810
you like be easier and you like sha-1

204
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,150
and I like md5 and I like a yes

205
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,400
and I wake no compression at all

206
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,350
means our messages won't provide any
cover for each other

207
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,120
and worse yet if I choose really
unpopular version of pgp

208
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,280
I might be the only guy sending messages
through cyberpunk network with divers

209
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,140
the PDP's I think the whole segment that
work citing me

210
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,509
really

211
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,549
I'm naked arm and

212
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:21,699
segments of has many features to make
the situation even worse

213
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:25,799
the news can see blunting attacks and
there's all kinds a

214
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,319
the variations on these weren't supposed
is if you are an active attacker if you

215
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:30,819
own some

216
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:34,399
network and you want race 1 message is a
goes

217
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,790
to remember just block all the other
messages they're going to that's a

218
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,209
pantry Miller for a while

219
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:43,529
and just looked out one through and see
what message comes out

220
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,910
also these retailers don't change their
keys

221
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,999
at all or if they do very slowly so if
message goes through you wanna break the

222
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,239
key that was used

223
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:56,869
to encrypt a message you got years

224
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:01,949
possibly to break into that server break
the operators kneecaps

225
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,309
break them down with bribery whatever
and many more

226
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:08,618
now just one hop proxies which

227
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:12,829
are week as one side just watch the
one-hop proxy

228
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,509
on the router or no on the proxy

229
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,540
better yet you know but if you just want
you see okay

230
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,899
somebody connects connection goes out
few bites in

231
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,129
a few bites out there's a trivial timing
correlation between you know if you're

232
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:26,949
watching the proxy

233
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:30,779
or if the proxy actually stores any
information itself

234
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:34,970
then justs attacked the proxy get the
information

235
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,899
arm legally et cetera et cetera arm and

236
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:42,489
when talk about what happened to
depended a bit for a while right now the

237
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,579
only systems the people

238
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,049
seems to be paying money for though are
one hot proxies which is

239
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:51,959
juries imagining them here now what
should our friendly on the red

240
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:52,939
backgrounds do

241
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:55,579
in order to do this and through some
talk im about the brothers not cause I

242
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:56,589
really wanna help mile

243
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:59,919
but because these attacks are easier to
understand

244
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,119
then low-budget versions now

245
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:06,699
what am i assuming the attacker can do
here I'm assuming that

246
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:11,369
they can break into many observers on
the network I'm assuming that they can

247
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:14,879
star observers on their own and say
hello I am a student at a German

248
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,549
technical college and I am very
interested in helping people be

249
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:18,199
anonymous

250
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,970
please use my server and you know under
many different false identities

251
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,419
I'm assuming that they can eavesdrop on

252
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:30,220
pretty much all the Internet or most of
the Internet or just good chunk of the

253
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,740
Internet

254
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,049
now with you some cost-benefit analysis
here

255
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,559
this stuff doing against the network

256
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,749
is only a good idea if the intelligence
agency doesn't have a lot of specific

257
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,619
suspects

258
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:47,139
Birgeneau if they're after you in
particular they wonder what you're doing

259
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:47,829
in particular

260
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:51,259
is probably eaves easier to eavesdrop
upon you personally

261
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,559
or both your keyboard personally or

262
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,919
kidnap you personally this

263
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,939
stuff would only ever get used I I
imagine they'll tell me what they're up

264
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:03,339
to

265
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,549
I imagine if they don't have enough
resources

266
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:10,539
to target all the users individually arm

267
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:15,379
underhanded if you are nefarious and
devious enough to

268
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:20,169
compromise is a major telco then this is
you

269
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,539
you can run a lot of servers you can
probably cover my eyes more servers in

270
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:24,389
just the telco

271
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,429
and you can watch a good chunk of the
network so just bowling see systems what

272
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:29,879
do you do

273
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:34,549
you watch both ends you win time in
correlation works great

274
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,459
on you know once again and combined with
volume correlation

275
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,230
that is how much comes in how much goes
out you can

276
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:48,249
really well arm link a wave requester to
the website that they're going to

277
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:50,139
assuming that you can see both ends

278
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:53,149
so you can say okay

279
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:57,089
arm this guy arm went

280
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,489
arm sunny but the size in HTTP request

281
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:05,239
something about sized in HTP request and
in between the two

282
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:09,009
he got a small thing about this many
bytes

283
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,679
and after the second one he got a much
larger file okay

284
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:16,738
know this website over here 500 mil
seconds

285
00:16:16,739 --> 00:16:20,169
after the request dot an HTTP request

286
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:24,139
and then immediately reply to something
about the same size what the first I got

287
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:24,860
back

288
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,389
and you currently like that and assuming
that he gets a second page on that

289
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,389
website

290
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,899
and a third page in a fourth page if
you're watching both ends

291
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,289
you can win and worse yet you might not
even need both ends

292
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,499
suppose you already know what images are
on CNN dot com

293
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:45,829
how big they are arm how

294
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:48,999
say various popular web browsers respond

295
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:52,549
to getting the page after they've
received the first cave the page the

296
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:54,439
second K the third K

297
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,939
and you can build a fingerprint of what
CNN dot com looks like

298
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,779
when you fetch it you even need to be
looking at CNN dot com to see the sum is

299
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,270
seeing the main page

300
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,599
what about parenting couldn't we just
how

301
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,569
Atlas who are trying to protect just
always send a fall

302
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,628
I'll let's say 10 K into the network
every second

303
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:19,089
and that way heard channel

304
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,510
to her would look the same no matter
what was going on

305
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:27,730
this would work if you could do it and
you can afford it

306
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,820
there have been lots have needs three
designs

307
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,529
but nothing like this has actually been
deployed arm

308
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:38,500
and there's a couple reasons why it has
been deployed for some at the

309
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,520
infrastructure

310
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,270
yeah you can afford a constant battle
with the fairly

311
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,639
easily a consumer prices these days but
the infrastructure to support

312
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:52,260
a whole bunch of people always
connecting the same amount

313
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,570
always connecting at the same volume
data always use ever

314
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,320
is not proven economical arms are no
systems tried it

315
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,230
briefly i len says for a day

316
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,279
arm and did proved to be too expensive
I've heard

317
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,309
ions another problem with this approach
is that

318
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,100
if you own one of the routers and Elston
x3 you even if she's

319
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,080
give you a perfect pet stream you can
choose pickups into that stream

320
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,949
and arm all the sudden alice is

321
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,010
is no longer sending at a constant rate
and you can see our dinner any requests

322
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,440
on the other end the convo with little
pickups in them

323
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,419
the match the pickups either added so
this works for Big Brother

324
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,700
know what would you guess hi Leanne Sea
Systems I'll let these are hard

325
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,020
the brother has to work a little bit
here arm these are

326
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,250
this is pretty good tech for being
fairly honest

327
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,740
the best traffic analysis thing that we
no up against these

328
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,889
is long time term statistical claiming
correlation

329
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:58,539
otherwise known as intersection attacks
now this can only works for long-term

330
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,408
patterns

331
00:18:59,409 --> 00:19:03,600
Alice has to be talking somebody for a
long while Bruce Wayne has to be sending

332
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,610
messages signed Batman for you

333
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,450
use or at least for a few dozen messages
depending

334
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,190
and it could take lots of traffic to
succeed the critical factor here's

335
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:16,799
media houses lucky it takes too much
traffic

336
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,929
too much being more than she sends too
much being

337
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:22,960
more than her lifetime too much being

338
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,260
she doesn't talk to the same people
anymore after too much passes

339
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,430
arm now recent research in last few

340
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,860
years people who only started so I try
to write papers on will what's the best

341
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,530
way to do this how long does it take

342
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,830
the research I like best for this was
why I wrote

343
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,970
I Corona these papers so I'm I may be
biased here

344
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,010
but the most consumers I think reno's
calls statistical disclosure

345
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,460
the bizarre just watch the network for a
long time you watch who sends

346
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,160
who receives when and you note you pick
some target Alice

347
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,520
and you know it's okay when elsa sending

348
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,840
how many messages to people tend to
receive an hour

349
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,189
on average how many messages does each
person whoever receives sent to get on

350
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,690
average

351
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,940
and then you see anyone else isn't
sending how many

352
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,130
messages does everyone tend to get on
average

353
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,310
and you know you pick up you get to be
columns

354
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,179
and venues subtraction

355
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,130
to notice that there are some people who
get what who get more messages

356
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,790
when elsa sending then when she isn't
sending knows as you might imagine

357
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,810
this can take a really long time for you
to get

358
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,600
for these differences to become apparent
so and how

359
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,970
long this takes depends on a bunch of
actors some gonna

360
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,290
talk to you a little bit about what the
results are here

361
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,520
but before %um I can imagine that arm

362
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,900
in order to analyze the stuff I'm going
to show users results from simulations

363
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,280
all models are over simplified and these
over civil cations me make what I'm

364
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,490
about to tell you

365
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,360
inaccurate to a greater or lesser degree
so don't go

366
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,290
sticking your life on anything but I'm
about to say

367
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,860
so we Reina analyze this attack on a
simulated network

368
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,930
and what the biggest thing to slow down
the attack

369
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,330
was having more variance in how long
messages were delayed

370
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,710
there's every message is displayed
exactly an hour that sucks

371
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,530
but if a message might come out in a
longer interval of time

372
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,280
then arm then you have to say well okay

373
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,379
up then the effective each

374
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,660
individual messages less visible so

375
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,660
the results we got were when

376
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,770
when messages there when message latency
variance

377
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,830
is low then if you send lots of traffic
at once

378
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,750
you lose fairly quickly like on the
order of a hundred rounds where around

379
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,510
is maybe

380
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,700
half an hour so that's like

381
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,240
two days on the other hand if you send
messages infrequently

382
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,710
then you last longer if you wanna more
detail about the stuff I'm

383
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:01,770
I can tell you what were the papers we
can read it are your hand if

384
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,620
message to leave variance is much higher
then

385
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,280
everyone gets more protection even

386
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,680
me traffic guys get still lose more
slowly

387
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,940
but low and high traffic people get more
protection

388
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,390
when there's more variance in when their
messages might come out

389
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,790
so that's a key part to keep in mind
when arm

390
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,760
wanna talk about this other the other
tax which will talk to among other

391
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,210
things

392
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,190
on how you can try to force people to
use

393
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,360
arm more insecure networks so

394
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,980
what else powers on a highly in C
network and we'll be brother

395
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,770
well nobody's perfect if else only sends
the same amount

396
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:50,889
then she wins again still except pick up
think underhand everyone's computer is

397
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,020
down sometimes

398
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,990
everyone has their cable company
inexplicably shut them off on occasion

399
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,110
so what's assume Dallas is only 99
percent

400
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,200
online sending traffic well she doing
pretty well if she's on a very high

401
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,320
variance network

402
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,939
which is the wine on top it takes more
than a million rounds

403
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,080
arm which is like 50 more than fifty
years

404
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,490
at half an hour around to get out less
than on the other hand

405
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,300
she's doing slightly better but still
breakable

406
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,360
if she's on a little over its network
supporting can help

407
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,600
sometimes if you're online enough

408
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,900
so that's all well and good for big
brother

409
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,400
but what can we do if we've only got you
now

410
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,650
oh the resources of the UFO Colts

411
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,850
or you know a couple spare weekends

412
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:47,240
and we want to attack the most secure
enemy networks in the world

413
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,670
well first thing you don't need to be
global basic idea like

414
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,810
this last attack was the sister call and
if you take in statistics course are you

415
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,020
know lost as you know

416
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,750
you easy everything's just 26 you can
sample so you run to surfers

417
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,880
you pretend to be two different people
and you get us meters and servers you'll

418
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,120
see one over and squared off the traffic

419
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,100
both entering and leaving three you ands

420
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,790
that's a sample well is that a good
enough sample not

421
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,270
always if there are enough other servers
b-sides you arm

422
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,150
this is a simulation for an attacker who
only sees part of the network

423
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,440
and arm detector doesn't really starts
to get slowed

424
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,630
doesn't start to succeed until they see
about point to

425
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,050
or .3 love the traffic other network at
all which means

426
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,180
arm to see to see twenty percent up the
traffic

427
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,920
up their work both entering and leaving
you need to be watching or owning

428
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:50,160
forty percent of the surfers which it's
unclear that you could pretend

429
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,070
arm that you could take over that much
of the network without anyone noticing

430
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,800
hey

431
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,880
arm these guys all talk alike an act
like

432
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,270
or without noticing hey also under
stress as many servers as there used to

433
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,350
be in the last week

434
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,060
so and if you're if you're not
intelligencia might be hard for you to

435
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,540
do that without getting caught so

436
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,560
what can you do we need more data how
can we get more traffic

437
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,139
to go through but so we got a few notes
now how can we get people to send more

438
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,030
traffic through our nodes

439
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,860
well we're a more servers arm let's go
for start

440
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:28,480
we can compromise more servers there's a
lot of people running servers

441
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,060
crew show up do for a while go any

442
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,330
is in when checking whether or not you
know

443
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,750
their boxes are secure there's some
retailers running on on windows are they

444
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,590
fully patched

445
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:43,250
who who knows arm another fun thing to
do as well

446
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,420
we talked how the client picks up our
how does the climb pic the power

447
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,920
the pic from among the servers they know
about

448
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,510
how they come to know about servers the
downloader directory observers

449
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,860
let's run our own directory until people
to better directory than the other

450
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,550
directory

451
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,110
because we're smarter than they are and
we love anonymity more than they do

452
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:07,080
and what's recommend the servers that we
control our own or compromise

453
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,570
morning I was like it should be able to
get us a few more percentages for those

454
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,500
people who

455
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,650
we fall in fact we could BB

456
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,060
deal West the servers that we don't
control in and make them look bad

457
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,760
so the honest directories will say hey
those guys there seem to run so good

458
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,990
order down sometime

459
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,110
maybe should use this guy he doesn't get
the rest so much and

460
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,130
Ange the service the that

461
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,610
already asked directors will the trust
to check a reliable you are

462
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,990
well right now the way they do that its

463
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,560
sometimes possible to differentiate
their reliability probes

464
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,690
from real traffic will hear dis on a
server you better treat this reliability

465
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,490
probes

466
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,160
as as special precious cargo

467
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,020
to be given priority over everything
else would you can drop whatever you

468
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:53,490
like

469
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,410
and then you look better than everyone
else west to do a good job to trade with

470
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,150
her everything

471
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,650
and every way to see more of a traffic
well

472
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,670
the choose a random entry and a random
exit clients

473
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,730
jus random entry and exit but

474
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,330
what if you were running a special
service that no one else was

475
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,199
it was awful everybody but this will for
people arm

476
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,310
this has been tried with some success
against

477
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,929
Richard their people doing this now and
no one can prove whether they're doing

478
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,110
it with dishonest intent or not

479
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,900
but rate a closed source special service
that only you can run

480
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,370
see it's amazing it's wonderful more
knowledge than in one anything else

481
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,600
and you can only get it when you exit
from Meijer emailer now instead of

482
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,090
people you see the traffic whenever
people choose one of your

483
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,260
Miller's for entry and exit the on those
the people who like your eggs a service

484
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,180
arm you'll see the traffic whenever they
choose one of the other ones you control

485
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:49,700
is your

486
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,810
as their entry so you'll see a larger
service for them

487
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,860
arm you don't beat all the people

488
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,510
but the ones who do you use you you be
more thoroughly

489
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,900
another approach is try to split the
anonymity network

490
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,160
for your own software get the operators
to heat each other stuff you'd start

491
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,080
fights

492
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,929
getting to split DPP some people like
these are something like that guy's

493
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,070
ans I guess it's more network yes some
people won't use your server anymore cuz

494
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,530
you been a dick for so long

495
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,290
but the ones who use you and

496
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,389
the other people who are you and the
people who like

497
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,690
you more than the other guys as this
morning workouts you get more the

498
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,570
traffic

499
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,030
now hope you get more detail from the
traffic the you do see

500
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:38,190
well if there's any disagreement in
users among their chosen preferences

501
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,530
among where they get their directory
information you can exploit them out

502
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,620
to try to make users not look like each
other anymore and NP that interests us

503
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,660
to call

504
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,700
arm attacks so for instance

505
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,520
if there's two directories and one of
them says thats

506
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,190
this is a good server and that's about
server and 1 I'm so they're both good

507
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,300
servers

508
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,660
then any user who uses the server the
one thinks is bad

509
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,730
isn't using directory that things that
server is bad

510
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:11,520
so you know it if you know what director
users using that helps you but even if

511
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,100
you don't know

512
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,160
you can split of traffic that using that
server from the rest to the traffic for

513
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,640
purposes

514
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,960
urinalysis also you can try to classify
exiting messages like

515
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,720
you know there's like like its split all
the messages written

516
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,340
in persian off from the message is
written in English

517
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,700
arms but the ones about astrophysics off
from the ones

518
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,390
about psychology you know it's split the
one signed about me on off from the ones

519
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:44,020
sign Superman its you know basic star

520
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,350
only trick you can do is and it is also
has happened against

521
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,030
the current mix masters like a punk
networks

522
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,450
break your server now this is
counterintuitive but

523
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,980
if if you're a little bit broken like so
you censor messages they go out

524
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,840
some servers will say some directory
service will see you're providing a real

525
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,070
ex is server

526
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,120
some will say know that but Sri or their
nominated they don't care whatever

527
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,550
that way some users will use you as an
exit

528
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,770
and some won't based on what directory
they use and

529
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,300
you partition users again another fun
thing to do is change your keys and

530
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,680
options and name all the time

531
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,800
this also has happens and

532
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,930
when you do that you can tell when
someone found out about you

533
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,150
based on what they call you what they
think your key is and what they think

534
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,530
you can do

535
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:36,690
so these are all sneaky moves the

536
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,290
I don't know if they're malicious but
their happenin so

537
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,960
ions you know if if we're determined to
be little brother here then

538
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,600
we might want to get in line with that
another fun thing to do is to turn the

539
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,340
traffic was confusing bike

540
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:52,420
the more traffic there is on the network
the more cover their ears

541
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,570
for the traffic that we care about so
was free get people not use network

542
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,560
let's let smear it lets

543
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,710
defamation campaigns let's use the
network to do things that people won't

544
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,630
like

545
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,860
so we can start flame were saying that
anonymity is for jerks

546
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:12,360
and trolls and terrorists and bad people

547
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,420
to trigger you know make people not want
to be anonymous sends

548
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,020
then the people who really need to be
anonymous don't have that many people

549
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,870
behind a mom

550
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,910
so for last section of attack someone to
talk about

551
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,670
how can we maybe think outside the box
what are some ways to attack anonymity

552
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,060
networks

553
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,110
that don't go against their strong suit
which is resisting traffic analysis but

554
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,110
the go around and I'm

555
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,820
weaving some pretty is one here for
instance you know

556
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,750
break into the box find a buffer
overflow in the software is just

557
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,550
software I mean

558
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,570
there's some pretty good programmers
raining pretty good software in this

559
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,960
area but

560
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,980
thereabouts in the past ends there may
well be bugs

561
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,990
in the future people having found out
about

562
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,440
arm and a smaller things like Disney on
technical style on a tree

563
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,440
also known as you as literary forensics

564
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,090
officially is you watched you identify
went to tax

565
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,750
are written by the same author now this

566
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,380
is sometimes a pseudoscience used to
prove the elvis really rude old

567
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,860
Shakespeare's plays

568
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,480
but I its its becoming pretty

569
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,360
well arm somewhat on the on more
statistical

570
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,160
bases think that he's from AI taking
techniques for machine learning and so

571
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,750
on

572
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,910
and it's been used to make pretty
convincing arguments about

573
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,680
disputed Federalist Papers miscellaneous
bloggers

574
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,140
arm there's this one ass book that was a
tribute Elle Frank bomber probably

575
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,560
wasn't written by him but nobody could
prove who was written by

576
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,590
arm some Sherlock Holmes stories the
some people were written by Conan Doyle

577
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,790
but weren't and so on and

578
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,280
there've been a few papers about this
before for taking a more sensitive

579
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,879
personal but it's really taken off

580
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,780
as a as a field in computer science in
the last decade or so and I think we'll

581
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,870
be seeing a lot more about

582
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,850
now how do you do this it turns out you
might think okay

583
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,890
among look punctuation I'm I wanna look
at spelling

584
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,030
while you can't spell the word
approximates

585
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:17,010
or you know you use really funny line
breaks but

586
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,150
the ones that are the have actually gone
the most research and and seem to work

587
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:24,570
the most reliably for people who right
well are

588
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,620
relative frequency of comment and
function words like all for Bart

589
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,950
if bar it seems the most benefit is
looking at the 30 most common alive

590
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,190
I've seen people look at 50 most 100
most

591
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,650
arm Richard don't function words go for
non function words that are also common

592
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,820
arm the new use techniques like
principal component analysis

593
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,919
arm or use different machine learning
person is a simple techniques

594
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,960
and if you're interested here I can tell
you some papers afterwards you might

595
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,910
want to read

596
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:58,210
by a I don't have time to do all the
statistics during the stock

597
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,780
to identify which features for yourself
are most useful class by authors

598
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:06,730
and then star cluster messages there by
the same other now

599
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:11,159
have you been posting to Usenet you put
into use that regularly

600
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,730
if so there's a large corpus of training
messages

601
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:18,490
the someone can use to identify your
writing style

602
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,770
and learn a fairly well and then
possibly identify

603
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,630
largest like thousand-word plus maybe
chunks attacks

604
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,200
for whether they're likely you are to be
by you or by somebody of them I suspect

605
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,340
and there's a there's paper about that
particular where they

606
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:38,000
they try to sow and got really good
results in linking

607
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,210
Usenet posters I don't know if anyone
strides uses 20

608
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,770
all anonymous posters the cyberpunk
let's turn our by would be neat now

609
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,380
now something also rose buds or is

610
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,660
most to the high profiles so I'm a tree
you read about

611
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,230
isn't automated and you know

612
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,480
is probably if you're really want to
find out who wrote what

613
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,640
and your government and you really
curious person in particular

614
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,279
you don't you principal component
analysis you you you ask around you

615
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:08,549
publish with the road you say hey

616
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:15,549
who likes to talk about this stuff ands

617
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:20,180
yeah thanks for being dumb you murderous
bastard

618
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,729
arm not legal attacks attacks

619
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:28,289
you might try to sue re mailers to get
them to turn over their keys

620
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:31,900
to get them to arm shutdown to say

621
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,529
you were used to send a threatening
message to me and better having but

622
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:39,670
this is mainly useful to harass the
network and try to

623
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,719
shut people down on it its less useful
against good

624
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,900
well written well run re Miller's
because they don't keep logs so they

625
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,670
can't tell you after the fact

626
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,339
where the message came from and also
kinda counterproductive because

627
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:57,519
after you sued a buncha people on one
sometimes lost sometimes

628
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,789
the rules now knows which what
jurisdictions you can't win

629
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:05,479
in what remembers won't give up to you
for instance

630
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:09,779
we now know several countries in which
room ops successfully

631
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:14,559
defeated legal cases from the Church of
Scientology to get them to do one thing

632
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,279
or another

633
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:18,279
and we know some remarks who

634
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:22,039
folded under pressure ans renowned

635
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:26,839
and now thanks to their lawsuits the
world knows

636
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,209
which you'll where they can't win their
lawsuits

637
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:35,390
on the other hand if you can do a legal
tactic comes along with the gag order

638
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,459
so people don't know whether or not
someone has buckled

639
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:42,499
or withstood you or who you tried to
attack

640
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:45,779
then that's a different matter for

641
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:51,049
for legal tax and you might get better
results and then there's social

642
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:51,880
engineering

643
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,920
I'm this would be hoped that social
engineering here some fun things you can

644
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,209
say to anonymous people

645
00:36:57,209 --> 00:37:01,479
you're a brilliant person you come up
with the most wonderful what

646
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:05,089
anti-government ideas I've ever heard I
love your manifesto

647
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:08,538
can we meet sometime I bet you're cute

648
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:11,849
here's another fun thing you can say

649
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:16,179
these new allegedly high-security reply
blocks the mix million users

650
00:37:16,179 --> 00:37:20,839
are real pain I can't figure them out
could you please send me a cyberpunk

651
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,808
reply blocked the streets less secure
but I believe that ice cap figure out

652
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:25,660
this new system

653
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,129
come on please here's another funny

654
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,130
you say mix masters in secure

655
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,369
I have ironclad proof that I can't tell
you insert a three-page nonsensical for

656
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:40,239
flame use this web page on the other
hand it's completely secure

657
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,390
you can't fool all the people all the
time but

658
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:47,699
you know you you for some people some
other time and there are people who go

659
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,569
around saying the stuff I don't know
whether they're

660
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:53,869
merely misguided or deliberately trying
to

661
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:57,109
do something that and then there are the
standard meets basic

662
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:01,759
attacks that I don't need to go into you
I only want Chula and you

663
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:05,119
the various people who may be watching
this

664
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,480
in the audience were on tape know the if
you want

665
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,390
to do things to force me to introduce
vulnerabilities and decoded i right

666
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:17,210
I prefer the I prefer to be seduced
rather than having my kneecaps broken

667
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,309
just a request

668
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:23,940
so what do we do about all the stuff
well

669
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,569
don't be dumb first off don't use the
broken systems the system has unknown

670
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:28,130
attack

671
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,000
that's better than end to end traffic
analysis then

672
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,559
don't use it and a lot of these your tax
go away no against

673
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:40,630
traffic analysis for high latency
networks work we do well if you really

674
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,650
care about

675
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,349
if you think be brother is outs would be
interested in what you're doing

676
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:49,009
but you think they're not interested
enough to be already booking your house

677
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:52,119
then you limit the volume you sent

678
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,779
no use sends the couple messages to
probably OK use networks with highly

679
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:57,829
variable ENC

680
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:02,789
padding helps some but it has to be just
one packinghouse be you know

681
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:07,160
I send one message every day whether I
have a message to send or not

682
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,680
it can't be I'm gonna be wild and wacky
and send messages when the fancy strikes

683
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:11,990
me

684
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:14,580
we simply that too and just

685
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,930
doesn't help much arm you check paper
for

686
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:21,569
info don't be spiky don't send big
spikes a message

687
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,570
is if you wanna send 10 messages and
stay anonymous police say for sending

688
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,550
them wanted a

689
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,100
and sending a big spike all at once no
constructing houses for believes the

690
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,710
system's

691
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,250
one thing to do is if you think your
guest limited attacker

692
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,680
well in the long run if you keep using
different entries and exits

693
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,919
eventually you'll choose an entry and
exit but their attacker

694
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,560
knows but if you hold your entry fixed
almost you've already chosen

695
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,299
an entry that attacker knows then that
attacker can see you enter

696
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,660
only works Kingsland attackers but scare
from saint

697
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,410
arm cashing on the last note has been
proposed

698
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:03,200
in it might help some but no one has
proven it the idea being that you know

699
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,700
if not all web requests actually result

700
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,640
in a request to a website because the
network itself is cashing

701
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,480
that might help but there's no one else
is proving it does

702
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,510
so nothing might you might reduce try to
smooth out protocols a little bit

703
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,140
arm this is very can't we be

704
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,410
but and no one's really proven any any
ideas that would work other than our

705
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,569
back of the envelope level

706
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,430
the Holy Grail would be an economical
workable

707
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,319
long-distance constant volume padding
system

708
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,160
arm people keep proposing these

709
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,370
arm and they don't get bill mostly for
economic reasons

710
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,540
if you think you have a way to make one
economical

711
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,880
arm right up in

712
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,350
enough detail so the you know you really
are committing to one design

713
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,549
you can actually analyzer design in you
know tell me about it because

714
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:02,680
this this would really make you the most
important person in Emmett in anonymity

715
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,450
research

716
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:07,630
arm not against Rep Nelson general

717
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,970
arm lot of these attacks arm

718
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:15,230
depend on watching both ends so try to
enter and exit

719
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,690
in different places may be different
countries you know don't enter and exit

720
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:23,380
in the same country girls you know
someone who's you shopping all that

721
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,170
country's

722
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:27,930
ISP's ken police you both enter and exit

723
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,980
also choose different arm AS's on

724
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,990
but that is internet reading zones arm
try to summer your past

725
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:38,660
the dough all passed through the same
backbone ISP you know

726
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,930
try to enter and exit different three
different OS's so that

727
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,310
if somebody you know is

728
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,620
exploiting a

729
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,710
for an unknown OpenBSD vulnerability but
doesn't have any unknown

730
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,550
arm in a sling abilities or vice versa
then

731
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:59,420
hopefully arm they will be able to be
all three hours long about

732
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,450
and if these people buy these techniques
by arm couple guys that

733
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,560
publish como sooner another thing you
can do that with that should help some

734
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,630
is run your own re mailer and this is a
good thing anyway to do to help save the

735
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,110
world

736
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,580
but arm if you're running

737
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,299
your own re Miller in your house then
well gosh

738
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,150
its a lot harder to eavesdrop
connections between you

739
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,510
and your entry re mailer and a lot
harder for attackers to

740
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,180
find out what you're doing the way you
against attacks on the directory server

741
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,149
the mix million design includes and it's
not you don't mind

742
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,390
I'm working real hard on it arm support
for synchronize Confederated directors

743
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,069
has basically

744
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:42,710
want to cooperate in directories the
side in the interests of the user's

745
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,040
they will agree on who's a good surf on
which servers

746
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:50,300
there are it was from a reliable and
that way everyone sees the same view the

747
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:50,850
network

748
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,509
arm and not a trade to to be one
proposed

749
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,880
social network techniques to try to
limit multiplied

750
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,380
identity tech attacks letting I know him
he's a real guy

751
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,870
he knows her she's real and you know

752
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,609
and hopefully the people with a few
levels you're all gonna be a real people

753
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,930
and not like you know one kid with a
zombie network in Romania

754
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,279
arm but there are some heart issues here
because

755
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,020
if everyone has a different view whose
real the network isn't secure so it's

756
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,280
not quite the same as say pgp web trust

757
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,050
know his legal tax I am NOT a lawyer
this is not legal advice

758
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,080
arm jurisdictional diversity helps

759
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,720
you know the arm your worst comes to
worst save

760
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,470
re Miller's become illegal in the US and
I have to turn over the keys or go to

761
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:40,050
jail

762
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:44,380
you know well they're still haunt bring
other some jurisdictional diversity in

763
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:44,950
the network

764
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:49,000
about a third of courage master re
mailers are in the US about author in

765
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,570
Germany

766
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,690
and the other charter scattered
throughout the world

767
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:55,580
maybe make your path twisters actually
where go donate your eggs in the

768
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,290
singer's diction

769
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:00,430
and well they can only make you turn
over what you've got

770
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,700
so accepting one with the Briton

771
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,580
which hasn't screwed up was there but on
the can make UN General turnover

772
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,700
when you don't have so do not keep logs
yourself

773
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,350
and don't use servers the key blocks the
should

774
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:18,290
could be a darn thing but there are some
serves other the probably say I keep

775
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,700
logs because it smart

776
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,750
and I'm better because of that no good
style on a tree

777
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,000
you tried literally change your writing
style there was a new experience here

778
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,090
but the stuff that people

779
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:32,270
are looking at these techniques those
common function words are

780
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,320
not really things you constantly shoes
so you know

781
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,140
liberally misspelling things or trying
to type in a phony French accent may not

782
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:39,490
help

783
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:46,490
pew arm let's do some research later on
about whether alcohol helps

784
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,530
arm something else people have proposed

785
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:55,850
arm is to try to run style on for
yourself against your own writing

786
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,200
a jew and cheese stuff around randomly
unto you don't look like yourself

787
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,850
anymore

788
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,089
and then send it off it's so crazy it
just might work

789
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,900
but do is try to do is researched it
don't count on it

790
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:14,310
no one has tried whether or not that
works against principal component

791
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,330
analysis techniques

792
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,029
they will be fun research paper talk to
me if you'd like to correct it proving

793
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,780
that you could be style on a tree as a

794
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,170
snowed today would really gets lamacchia
researchers interested in this stuff

795
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:29,200
and would drag a whole bunch other
people into remembers it would be great

796
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:29,610
fun

797
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,890
against social tax number one educate
people

798
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,730
you can't make everyone smart but you
can make people not fall for standard

799
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:37,440
tricks you know

800
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,970
just like you can tell everyone that the
penis pump you hear about on the

801
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:41,910
internet is not

802
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,620
really gonna work the gentlemen in
Nigeria does not in fact

803
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,630
have a hundred million dollars the he
needs your help laundering you know

804
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,510
education help

805
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,850
other things to build clients so you
know it's harder for users to shoot

806
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,020
themselves in the foot that is

807
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,980
there shouldn't be any options which is
where one of the options means

808
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,230
don't be anonymous on what is labeled as
such

809
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,950
and you also minimize opportunity for
users to

810
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,900
make decisions armor that don't do them
any good

811
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,390
but make them look less like each other
so i MITI questions now

812
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,040
if you're interested in reading on the
research side of this there's a website

813
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,720
that

814
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,990
tries to collect arm anonymity papers

815
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,040
going back to charm through the present
and arm

816
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,520
for full disclosure I E main don't I
don't meet in the list by maintenance

817
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,160
offer them in his list

818
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,759
so yup questions

819
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,860
jokes

820
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:46,590
with a mic to sort it out

821
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,670
was the special service that was being
offered on

822
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:53,980
exit well arm with look let's see that
they're driven several what what what

823
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,420
sir

824
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,750
is one here i won

825
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,920
11 per smoker something okay one one fun
one

826
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,940
is arm that the old almost no no

827
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,560
offers is being able to set the from
address as you post to Usenet to

828
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,470
whatever you want

829
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,600
which as it uses but ok

830
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,450
prepare to leave you a few people offer
so all the traffic that must suck the

831
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,540
from address on Usenet filters right to
them

832
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,650
arm another more wacky one

833
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:25,120
arm was someone was going to

834
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:30,130
I do you can see has which is more to
drive most people away

835
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,060
so that you could just so in theory if
the person really distinguish

836
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,480
here is software where he picked some
words is randomly offensive

837
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,940
and censored them out if any message was
going to use net a pic really weird

838
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,140
words like someone is people's names he
didn't like

839
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,620
so and this is pretty weird

840
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,850
and I i can. was more examples of after
talk

841
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:57,850
yo

842
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,279
yeah i i you listen to the question is
arm

843
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,910
arm greet this is you know we all like
to think about how big brother Ken

844
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:24,629
can watch you better but we wanna be the
brother against the spammers and figure

845
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,150
out where they're coming from so

846
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:32,579
we can go do things up to the full
extent of the law but no more because

847
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:37,130
we're good people right but arm first
thing to remember is

848
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,480
spammers are really using anonymity
networks because

849
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,809
they don't need really strong anonymity
in fact

850
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:48,290
they don't want the kinda for enemy this
copper alternately remember

851
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:51,540
to try to get rich the new way to
receive payment

852
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,650
so number one attack computer payment
service seconds there

853
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,140
arm was muted easier for people with
cooperative

854
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,290
ISP's or two people with large zombie
networks

855
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:07,359
or people with large lists open relays
so if you wanna try suit so those are in

856
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:07,960
fact

857
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,430
one harp or no hop proxies so

858
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:16,710
arm if you were in a part of the world
where many machines

859
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,750
got compromised unused is on the
networks

860
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,400
if you had a good way to eavesdrop on a
few those machines or you were to put

861
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:23,890
out

862
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:28,250
a honeypot or you were to go this purely
theoretical course

863
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:31,430
arm some people are comfortable
endorsing system penetration machines

864
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:32,680
you don't own on camera

865
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,710
arm yah but

866
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:39,400
purely theoretically if you were to go
breaks and his army jeep ride on one hop

867
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:39,960
you know

868
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,849
where was this traffic coming from men's
you the only way to find out where the

869
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:44,670
storms were coming from

870
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:51,569
the interesting things about this is a
problem is that is that

871
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:56,130
you get more secure as more people are
using it so there's a very big social

872
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:56,780
component

873
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,319
I'm wondering if you have any sort of
numbers roughly or specifically about

874
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:05,670
how many people are using using them you
might expect say

875
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,869
5-10 years could be use systems yes

876
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:13,020
and how you would get more people I'm
how you get more people to use them

877
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:16,170
well if I could do whatever I liked

878
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:20,040
the way we have more people to use them
if so first off on one point thing but

879
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,420
wasn't arm

880
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,960
that no one will ever is is not only is
the

881
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,410
it is important for the more people use
these things to enemy and

882
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:32,339
I'm near the so-called network effect
technologies your telephone becomes more

883
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:34,240
valuable the more people you can call
with it

884
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,680
arm and enemy depends on that work
affects like it's not like pgp where

885
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,259
if you and I are the only two people in
the world the PTP then

886
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,520
we're you know we can still encrypt

887
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,190
and you can't or saying but you and I
are the only two people with nicks

888
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:49,960
million well

889
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,049
anything said would miss me came from
you or me in you know you can tell which

890
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:55,280
you can still shoot us both

891
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,339
but so how do you get more users tighter
first if you don't you need users the

892
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:00,950
hyde you

893
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:05,339
but it's ok if these users are terribly
clever about seeing an honest themselves

894
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:08,089
okay if like the screw up its ok if
they're running in secure operating

895
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:08,680
systems

896
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,680
they can still hide you if you write
software so that they

897
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,349
act the same as other people from the
worst point of view so number one

898
00:51:16,349 --> 00:51:19,599
better guey clients more of them

899
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,900
effect there yet make good plugins for
the

900
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,059
mail programs people already use bike

901
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:30,230
you if this came bundled with Microsoft
Office and

902
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,970
you have so many people sending cover
traffic purely by accident

903
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:38,200
more people that have been had ever used
network up till now

904
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,980
so arm yup better adoption better
usability or you know

905
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,530
only be two step like arm

906
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:50,250
you know get get more mail programs
people used a supported

907
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,180
get more education about why it's easy
make it cooler you know get more kids to

908
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,980
use a legal

909
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,839
up the early pgp adopters a lot of them
were people with you need for PGP

910
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:02,529
love the more people who just like
playing secret agent and playing with

911
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:03,780
cool codes and

912
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:08,000
you know and they might they didn't help
the other people get more corruption

913
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,770
but if using enemy it works they help
the people who really need to stay more

914
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:12,380
anonymous

915
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,210
arm there I arm how many are

916
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:21,799
notes on a typical mix network and arm
how many hops does it usually take for a

917
00:52:21,799 --> 00:52:22,309
message

918
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:26,109
recent destination arm well

919
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:29,869
other typical mix network which bears
his reign others too

920
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:33,230
so it it's it's hard to generalize for
example to arm

921
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,329
there's both fix dismal 50 on

922
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:40,540
Mixmaster safer punk most servers run
both protocols that run those

923
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,589
there's about thirty nine right now
running mix minion arm

924
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:48,540
and those numbers need to go up now

925
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,980
as for how many hops people usually
choose thats

926
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,109
that selected by people send messages
and the key factors seem to be these

927
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:57,598
days that's

928
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,079
on Mixmaster 7.2 some stuff is a
reliable so

929
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:04,900
you know if do you wanna send it through
too many services to me services to me

930
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,920
places that might drop your message by
mistake

931
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,210
so I think people choose usually choose
around 45 their

932
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:13,510
are makes me is getting reliable
delivery to pass longer than that so I

933
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:14,430
think people

934
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:18,029
my search using longer in Luling see
networks various technical reasons

935
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:21,380
it doesn't make sense to choose more
than three because the engine to tax

936
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,690
work so well the more servicemen's

937
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,619
talk to you if you find an interesting
point I can bore you to tears about it

938
00:53:27,619 --> 00:53:29,190
afterwards

939
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:34,490
arm hours as warning I you talked
earlier about their little brother

940
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:37,930
and hacks you know we're using long-term
siskel now sis your

941
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:42,420
Howell practical is it that those
actually work

942
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,109
her party was %uh that's it sounded like
whereas at the radically it's a threat

943
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:48,390
model

944
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,480
okay that's not enough threat if you can
see

945
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:56,200
about 20 percent of the traffic is
enters or exits onto the simulations

946
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,230
they do with you know again remember
also all simulations are

947
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:04,930
somewhere between wild guesses and

948
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,610
asking your psychic friends' but arm

949
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,500
so if you can see about 20 percent than
then you might win now

950
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,770
I bet you there's people at this
conference

951
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,280
who can you know reno's 50 servers on

952
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,380
Mixmaster network if you could get

953
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,030
you now arm another

954
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,060
you know twice if you get twenty three
of them you win

955
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:34,570
if you could get like a dozen servers up

956
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,990
that people didn't link together is you
Ange

957
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:41,290
you've gotten to be particularly popular
like

958
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,529
you know twice but we will use you could
win so I think it's something we ought

959
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,310
to be worried about

960
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:49,110
but many people my field tend to be
especially paranoid and

961
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:53,450
in fact there's economic incentive for
us be more paranoid than each other

962
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:56,850
because people trust us to more paranoid
we seem to be so

963
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:00,480
I'm likely to over exaggerate the
effectiveness of any attack

964
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,580
arm your

965
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:10,580
arm yes

966
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,760
okay so the question is whose
responsibility is it

967
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,010
the users or or the networks well if you
read networker your

968
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:30,630
building a network presume you're doing
it because you want people to be

969
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,400
anonymous

970
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,810
so you should put as much defense into
the network as you possibly can

971
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,830
on the other hand if you want to be a
non-issue

972
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,930
you should put in a reasonable offer
yourself but

973
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,980
you in the end arm you know

974
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,210
the system should be anonymous enough
that my grandmother can use them

975
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:54,150
to whistle blow against the AARP without
having

976
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:58,770
AARP death squads come against her
replace AARP with a more realistic

977
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,450
organization that might my grandmother
might not like

978
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:04,490
and nothing as grandmothers mine is not
computer literate

979
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:09,140
so we can't ask too much of the user in
general

980
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:12,600
it's great when they can do more but

981
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,210
arm another I'm better billing software
them

982
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,940
I am education I trade you education
things like this but

983
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:23,080
automatic socks do as much as you can
and

984
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,840
is that the I am almost dancing was that
the I'm done signal I got like two

985
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,350
minutes left was two quick questions

986
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,960
got one questions asked me after how
much bandwidth do I need to effectively

987
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,580
run

988
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,610
re Miller arm right now you can run a
mix million owed on a cable modem

989
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:42,860
about DSL speeds

990
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:47,350
DSL speeds arm biotech me after was try
and find out

991
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:52,549
worst-case 0 we doesn't work out you
turn off after week

992
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,410
arm there's all the good ones right now
sport bene with choking so you can use

993
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:56,670
as

994
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:00,340
as much or as little bit with as you
want and toward the end a router

995
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,420
also supports that I anyway us

996
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,850
I yeah key talks more about

997
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,040
Tom low latency

998
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,060
anonymity networks

999
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:18,100
specifically anything available for
surfing lebanon

1000
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,850
surfing the web anonymously full
disclosure I'm a developer on the system

1001
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,870
but we're developing something called
tour right now is not good enough to

1002
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:26,339
keep

1003
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,120
the NSA from finding out that your
googling for

1004
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:36,299
arm you know all for I don't know
metallic mp3's

1005
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,920
but if you want to keep people hope from

1006
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,960
snow from sniffing your password is

1007
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,910
you browse or from easily figuring out
where you're going

1008
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,220
then it's probably enough for you if
you're interested in stopping

1009
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,200
porn sites for getting your IP it's also
probably good enough for you arm

1010
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,810
also for those applications what a
commercial stuff like

1011
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:01,350
anonymizer Dakar may or may not be good
enough for you I have no affiliation

1012
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,650
with not much to come

1013
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:06,320
and I'm outta time said and if you wanna
talk let's talk later

1014
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:06,950
thanks everybody
