57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,910
now monk

59
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,690
for four years we've been on the air for
years that I am

60
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,940
four years for you and joins John

61
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,280
I am we hear can be a far we started as
the bowler underground radio group we

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,900
became bolder free radio

63
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,770
an and we have been broadcasting in
Colorado in Boulder

64
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,090
an region which if any have you know
it's kinda near Denver capital

65
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,120
central Colorado I am

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,728
and its it's Ben s values run firm

67
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,889
our money so far and we keep doing it we
have to keep on the air for a long time

68
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,300
and their we have had overwhelming

69
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,560
support from the community and we just
keep getting bigger and bigger so I'm

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,479
just gonna tell you a little bit about
how we started

71
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,690
%um basically we had someone come

72
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,490
and two this is how I got involved
anyway we had some gonna 2600 meeting

73
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,860
I'm in Boulder looking for Kb afar

74
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,590
their radio station that was on an
because they figured home media to

75
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,129
happen

76
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:55,939
doing a radio on and so we aren't really
like how there's pirate radio and

77
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,189
boulders on awesome

78
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:00,610
and we we ended up finding getting in
contact with the guys and we basically

79
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,199
got

80
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,310
whole hacker community all kinds
involved

81
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,039
in pirate radio and at that point we
started coming up with

82
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:12,210
all kinds van new DJ's new programming

83
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,560
and I'm we be expanded we started at

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,199
opening am stations in Longmont
surrounding town

85
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,370
and yes some people in Denver we learn
how to use streaming radio station

86
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,539
news archive shoutcast staff so we can
have the broadcasters actually in a

87
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,590
different location and transmitter

88
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,050
and so we ended up protecting our DJ's
that way so

89
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,300
basically that the hacker scene is right
there in

90
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,740
the middle the help I really a scene out
there and I am

91
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,229
and their Anna

92

yeah okay so let's yeah okay let's
introduce everybody and

93
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,699
talk a little bit about how we got
involved in why we got involved and

94
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,559
and whatnot but like I said I got
involved with a 26-year meeting I'm

95
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:04,379

um ok let me just tell you a little bit
about what I know

133
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,139
monk is BS what I've called BM

134
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,710
benefactor a Kb fr he

135
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,190
air was the first guy he started a in
his basement

136
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,250
his story as far as I know and I wish I
am

137
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,669
maybe let him retell little bit he
wanted to start a legal station

138
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,000
and he went out and started all the
whole process for getting a license

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,380
and by I love this very nice

140
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,050
what he calls Cadillac equipment its FCC
approved

141
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,680
expensive in top-line and I am

142
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,630
in the middle and his process to get the
license they changed the laws

143
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,800
and he was not going to be able to run
the kinda station that he intended

144
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,880
and couldn't get his license so

145
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,930
the way he put it is well I could put it
on your day

146
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,410
or I could just do it anyway and

147
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,339
and that's what he did an so we started
using this equipment in his basement

148
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,880
that that it got expanded we put it in
advance so that it would be mobile

149
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,900
nice when the ways that we allude that

150
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,939
FCC in make sure that we don't need a
hot mess we wanted

151
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,940
I think ur I think we've actually had an
opportunity to become licensed

152
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,540
on but at this point bucket very much
you

153
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,699
and whatnot I think we just keep an
underground

154
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,380
it's too expensive as well there's a
waiting list to get on a

155
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,930
fuck the SEC yes yeah I just

156
00:09:53,930 --> 00:10:00,710
each I mark you are you are you back our
QB a caramel do you live on the air here

157
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,970
awesome awesome so monk why don't you
want to take the reins for a minute

158
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,840
and and tell us your story okay

159
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,580
well I started and 2000 there was a

160
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,130
law that had been passed that was called
the LPFM low-power Mr

161
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,700
that would allow us to set up a hundred
watch stations so I went ahead and

162
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,940
started the process

163
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,680
I gotta I application for license a
ordered a transmitter from your

164
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,790
took about six months to get one and
during that time

165
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,689
I NPR and the National Association of
Broadcasters

166
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,980
change the rules so that nobody could
really get an LP a FM license much they

167
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,130
were stuck on the middle of a rural area
like

168
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,450
you to Wyoming and Utah desert get to be
too many creeks away from an existing

169
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,220
station cancellations so I was stuck to
the transmitter and I can get a life

170
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,410
had a choice selling on ebay or state
pocket

171
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,089
in put it up for put it up

172
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,600
and over time it has grown from me in my
basement

173
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,620
to now over 40 DJ's the 40 DJ's

174
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,120
I'm and about

175
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,570
I'm FTC burst I 5 SEC but

176
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,350
I after the first one we figured out
that they actually weren't as powerful

177
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,900
as they want you to think they are

178
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,690
and and that the real key to setting up
a pirate radio station in staying in the

179
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,330
air

180
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,720
is not being freed in the SEC that's
really the key

181
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,540
so that in the pac-10 tourney remain
anonymous we don't

182
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,410
use our real names ever and I'm and we
stay mobile

183
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,140
remove the station around quite a bit no
every time we get past

184
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,949
we pick this thing up and move it in
about takes about 30 minutes

185
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,600
started to tear it down and moved to
another location

186
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,990
are usually up within a few hours even
if you bust in a

187
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,350
bust about once every six to 12 months
Marin

188
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,460
so that's kinda the short version of the
story but

189
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,320
to that got enough to get started
awesome that's great and UN introduce

190
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,980

203
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,810
I know you guys are all drinking in the
van the quirky regions we were getting

204
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,850
trapped in a fan as well

205
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,170
there's a heart attack there's wine wine
beer and Red Bull

206
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,400
break but no drugs that's what are the
rules

207
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,460
yeah we have three worlds no drugs I

208
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:06,100
no gun no guns that was out on a bar one
of our DJ's have really popular in car

209
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,290
yeah and then that there was no one
under 18 because that

210
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,400
that make sure that the cops don't have
a reason to come in

211
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,690
busy three things that make FCC bus a
lot worse

212
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,890
cell yeah went on to if you know if you
do those treating

213
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,060
no drugs no guns no one under 18 there's
really very little that they can come up

214
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:26,400
with

215
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,550
to get you cancer institute a fourth
rule

216
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,720
to recently which is i infection right

217
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,840
and threatening small

218
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,070
we had some people making saying things
like on

219
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,250
referencing the leader of America and
you know

220
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,500
in a threatening manner during the next

221
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,120
it turns out that that depended atop
that steps of the secret service

222
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,020
I do you want to do that either another
when you can

223
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,030
yeah really the important thing to
remember is that even scary but

224
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,839
in day %eh Police Department

225
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,120
Yankees under the people that you really
don't want

226
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,370
you if you wanna go on the air do it

227
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,750
yeah can't get the IRS but and I rushed

228
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,330
and the INS sheet

229
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,520
and yeah the Patriot Act I'm

230
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,949
okay to I think that we should have a
just like a short run down a couple

231
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,100
things that am

232
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,590
I think that this crowd is interested in
an hour 1 a.m.

233
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,490
is our philosophy why we do it why we
don't want to be legal

234
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,140
and now why we are involved in the first
place the second thing is

235
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,990
how do we how do we set it up when you
wake women do we need an

236
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,720
how can you guys do it in their
hometowns and the third thing

237
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,950
is legal how do we get away with it

238
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,320
and so if we could just touch on all
these three subjects real quick

239
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,770
and then I think we can open it up to
you guys and

240
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,250
you can ask us you know we have four
years experience in hopefully we can

241
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,510
you can tell you how to do this in
whatever you want to know about area

242
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,540
and hopefully do it yet what he did more

243
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,650
the more stations we have the more
powerful

244
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,850
this becomes so I encourage everyone to
start their own station

245
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,190
yeah that we have we have a go ahead

246
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,320
it's alright we have a concept
everything we call our PR real public

247
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,400
radio

248
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,670
and we think that if if we can create a
network

249
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,930
thousand pirate radio stations we can
rival Clear Channel

250
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:34,580
in NPR in in terms of changing media
landscape and that's very possible to do

251
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,200
the actual starting in mid station is
not that expensive

252
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,690
you can do it for around a little pretty
little as a thousand dollars if you want

253
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,280
to really kick ass

254
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,410
I for about thirty five hundred five
thousand dollars you can set up

255
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,420
something is bed in your local town
sounds as good as you fifty thousand

256
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,500
what

257
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,300
their channel station within about a
Sixers ten-mile radius

258
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,660
so I'm it's really not that hard to do
you need a mixer

259
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,750
a computer in or a CD player mp3 player

260
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,870
a mic a transmitter and

261
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,529
antenna I mean and that's literally it
you would be astounded at how little

262
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:12,040
equipment actually take

263
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,569
stood up and run Paris H I if you want
to get to the

264
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,730
the other stream which is what could be
a part does

265
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,510
I mean we'll talk about that a little
more detail we actually use a thing

266
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,870
called in STL the studio transmitter
link which separates

267
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,250
studio itself were sitting right now on
the transmitters which is sitting

268
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,720
our way much several miles away can be
transmitted over the Internet

269
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,090
I'm be a stream is the studio itself

270
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:41,020
is a in essence a legal internet radio
station

271
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,630
they're sending a stream out to a server
in leave New Jersey right

272
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,110
right and then the transmitters

273
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,910
is sitting far away with it in a genuine
HP

274
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,839
I in a computer sucking their stream up

275
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,520
a from New Jersey for a I guess I'll
what's really going on as we're

276
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,490
broadcasting

277
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,359
here to New Jersey back from New Jersey
to the

278
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,230
the studio transferring several miles
away was and send it out to the antenna

279
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,589
and makes it available to anybody want
those minimum

280
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:16,139
I'm radio here in Boulder yet caregivers
really grown to you

281
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,949
a national effort we have a internet
support in new jersey we have people

282
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:24,409
doing shows from let mexico maybe

283
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:29,809
Brooklyn soon when make I'm not yet but
the internet you can do it it's really

284
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:30,450
not hard

285
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,210
right because it's all done over the
internet now and this provides us

286
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,390
and if we could just segue into the next
section

287
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,510
some a.m. day

288
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,140
legal a anonymity

289
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,880
which a makes it scraper

290
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,250
30 days to you to get involved and not
get caught

291
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,640
right basically how work is out where
the F you to bite somebody

292
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,809
interview a warning your location
perched in the majors only

293
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:02,860
your view why and interview man or

294
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,970
yell it really media right movers that

295
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,620
every time get a warning from yesterday
so once you get the 1d

296
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,670
i'ma they have to give you a warning
first and and they have to find you

297
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,809
and when they find you to give you the
one cuz the SEC's primary goal is

298
00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:18,780
compliance a

299
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,210
really don't want to prosecute you they
want you to turn it off

300
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,580
because they don't have the real
resources to prosecute you there too

301
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,770
lawyers at the st. to concentrate on
radio

302
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,610
at it the entire country so if you if
you turned the transmitter are

303
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:39,220
they're happy they go away and then you
just move the transmitter

304
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,870
and return on a couple hours later you
will hear from again for six to 12

305
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,390
months

306
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,430

Florida it's not worth it

309
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,790

but it's the truth

310
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,300
alright um

311
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,399

talk about the FCC bust

312
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,850
that that act that I went through am

313

314
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,210
here in

315
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,960

319
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,730
and what do you think that we should
touch on I in Boulder

320
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,210
in Denver in the Boulder Denver
conglomerate & Clear Channel closet

321
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,400
an for you where

322
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,760
were a little well name lucky fortunate
in that they

323
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,100
own all the stations and there's not
very many stations so our station

324
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,420
doesn't really bleed

325
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,340
at all into any other stations so we
have and FM station ninety 5.3

326
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,550
retinal a dial you don't have to have
special call in a listen to us

327
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,649
it's not like 1026 or something you know
we're right there 95.3%

328
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,070
the closest station that's really
popular and bowlers

329
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,840
wat 97-03 Kb CEO you

330
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,080
yeah and for a while there we were proud
catching only nights and weekends and

331
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,740
the reason for this is going to get

332
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,990
titled on by the other seasons when he
stole your morning listeners

333
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:29,750
cell we decided when a I decided to move
to New York and we wanna be at this

334
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,330
at location in my driveway am for a few

335
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,159
I think it was like a month and a half
six six or eight weeks or something like

336
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
that

337
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,809
we decided that and fucking let's just

338
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:45,320
let's just go full time all through the
day and if they tattle on ice in a calm

339
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,780
date at a lot and so

340
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,559
but & Poor's during this period I got
bronchitis

341
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,220
and and I got Cody to help me sleep

342
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,920
mom I had bronchitis so one morning and
is a little while after I take

343
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,080
prescription and the PPP I was really
really sleepy in stone

344
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,470
and I looked out my window and I saw it

real name because they didn't show up

379
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,980
with a policeman

380
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,250
who is scary as oppose the SEC which is
not scary

381
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,000
and iight had my the house that I live
in was actually broken into a couple

382
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,929
months before

383
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:44,890
and the same policemen had come in taken
apart so he knew my name in your

384
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,640
not for any you know to disperse your
file

385
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,870
anyway good so I did you my real name he
ran the plates on all the cars

386
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:57,980
around to see Mike if any of these
people were coming off

387
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,530
and there is my real users like college
kids they're not gonna

388
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,710
am but for a period there the the two
SEC agents went back in walked around

389
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,690
the van

390
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,809
and that the cocky much music herb
Pennock wannabes

391
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:17,750
bus before well you know anything about

392
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,880
but an ugly I ya know

393
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,990
and I was released on as I had not got
no idea

394
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,880
good her so it was it was there and

395
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,100
the station was on and broadcasting

396
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,140
from the band during the entire busty
never went down

397
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,570
but um so basically we moved it a little
bit after that and I moved out here in

398
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,370
and it wasn't scary at all so am

399
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,400
maybe you want to learn about exactly
how you can get in trouble like if

400
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,840
you're caught on the high anchor

401
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,120
platonic what they can do to you and
then maybe we'll

402
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,360
open it up for questions alright luck
one thing and out most SEC agents are

403
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,210
they're very good at trying to
intimidate you they have recently

404
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,370
started bringing a top with them

405
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,440
I and a date that's a fairly recent
development

406
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,840
and they also now have a badge that
apparently by at like

407
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,559
a naked in a quiet some cultures or
locally in town to intimidate you there

408
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,000
is no SEC bad but the show you one

409
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,540
you know it day by day like it a cop
kink

410
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,920
yes as long as she and the only Allah
yes

411
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,650
this bullshit but they have no they have
no authority to arrest

412
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:32,650
they had no authority to you to issue a
warrant the only thing they have the

413
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,960
authority to do you stay up

414
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,679
you're running a pirate station were
actually sure that we think we can prove

415
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,950
in court so we can't we're gonna find
you eleven thousand dollars

416
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,720
they can do that but they have to be
able to collect it may have

417
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,640
think that they can win in court so if
you are for instance really poor

418
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,049
I mean your judgment proof your judgment
would you do whatever the hell you want

419
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,030
yes he can't do shit

420
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,660
year poverty the 8530 right will be

421
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,090
so so the other times we've been busted
me said several different stories for

422
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,270
different people I was the first to get
it

423
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,920
I am and bit they were buried they were
very pleasant ever play

424
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,970
I'm and they were like you're running a
pair station you have to understand I

425
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:10,360
said

426
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,540
you know same thing that ended which was
you know

427
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,440
I'm show me your warrants because I in a
TV shows do not let a federal agent in

428
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,210
your house without a warrant

429
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,220
and they are they wouldn't come in they
did not have a cockpit

430
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,429
first time that players that they just
started doing that which with I'm

431
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:29,660
with the nines first but then again and
ever since then

432
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,210
ours that was their second bus chartered
bus was

433
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:36,700
that at times top doctor jobs yeah

434
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,870
and they were actually pretty three
violent they were not nice

435
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,920
a they went after Dobbs pretty heavily
and trying to convince them that he had

436
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,549
to come down to the SEC office and

437
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:50,049
basically what it comes down to it they
have no power to do much

438
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,710
anything other than intimidate if you
believe them and you let them intimidate

439
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,950
you

440
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:58,910
they win if you don't believe them which
you don't have to

441
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,170
then they don't get to do anything they
have no powered do

442
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,470
anything so that's why you just gotta
play it cool

443
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,920
they don't know what the hell is going
on and turn it off if you turned off

444
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,940
go away with the SEC wants more than
anything else is compliance

445
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,470
they know better than to try to
prosecute but but

446
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,020
they do why complaint that allowed them
to go away and actually

447
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,139
have headed a email discussion with an
FTC agent in California

448
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,320
I'm and they this guy at least

449
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,649
he says is true whether agents they
think it's bullshit

450
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,940
agent themselves think it's a waste time
there's about 400

451
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,330
a DEA agent at least there were about
two years ago last time I checked

452
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,649
they're just too many car and others to
agents and the whole day

453
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,270
they're doing in Colorado courageous car

454
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,418
and there's 480 nationally and their
their job is to

455
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:53,010
to monitor all FTC

456
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,200
I'm actionable items things like the all

457
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,750
the phone companies all of the cable
companies all of the cellular companies

458
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,950
the garage door opener for me if
somebody's garage door openers opening

459
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,440
somebody else's garage door

460
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,440
in theory you call the SEC in the
Comanchero aggressors who screwed up in

461
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,940
building a garage door opener

462
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,710
all 802 11b anything Wireless it to 11g

463
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,429
all about that entire spectrum army yeah
I don't care you

464
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,480
so bottom line is you were just a pain
in the ass to them they don't want to

465
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,290
bother with that but if Clear Channel
called

466
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,960
the chairman the FTC issued damn it you
get pirates on Colorado

467
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,840
something's gotta happen the company
harass you so it's really just a raft

468
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,540
be treated that way and don't let it
bother you you just keep right on going

469
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,520
on

470
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,240
do not let the FTC internally let bottom
line do they really don't have any power

471
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,070
to do it

472
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,629
well the thing is now now we've
completely eliminated that

473
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:52,740
that you're better getting a questions
what a

474
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,200
mark you it only really here tonight

475
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,210
you same here I can hear him yelling the
chemicals words

476
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,960
trip so you gonna talk to the guy like
but the thing is

477
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,429
is now nowadays we've eliminated you
know all the fear factor

478
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:11,740
behind FCC because the not gonna bust
you because where you're transmitting

479
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,570
from

480
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,428
you're not actually transmitting from
you just got a streaming radio station

481
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:16,340
night

482
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,530
chan's me somewhere else so they're
gonna go there

483
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,799
the campus that personally because that
person believes it to be

484
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,179
the a ham radio repeater that

485
00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:30,500
you know someone thought that they had a
good location on

486
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,540
to put it up there and it's not even
there so so they can confiscate it all

487
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,200
they have to do is shut off

488
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,120
we go out there pick it up move the
internet again that's all you do

489
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,620
so there's no reason for the FCC yeah
it's a really sustainable set up in like

490
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,400
I said we've been here for years

491
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,970
everyone should do it it's not really
expensive in get involved because it's

492
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,100
your airways yet take it back to this is
all about taking back the airways

493
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,520
because

494
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,129
you know the reality is there's airwaves
/url are limited

495
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,410
resource like that like the air the
earth and sky man

496
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,809
and the SEC is supposed to protect in
the public interest in but they refused

497
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:07,610
done is a

498
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,860
fucking sold it off the highest bidder

499
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:16,360
that's what's happened and and what you
gotta do what all you guys have to do is

500
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,630
help us take it back

501
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,780
you and but at least a thousand other a
group of people

502
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,710
over the next five or so years can
absolutely do that we can change the

503
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,030
media landscape

608
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,690
I've been spending and obscene amount of
time in

609
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,790
one the most the grossest places you
could possibly imagine going to

610
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:41,310
United States Senate am and I trying to
%ah

611
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,420
trying to convince all the senators and
congressmen to get rid of this stupid

612
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,000
law

613
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,050
right yet offers me that people all week

614
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,220
things congress creatures whatever they
are

615
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,230
yet so are in are we actually have a a
lot of stuff up on our website about

616
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,200
about how to get that stupid law
repealed hand and get all those

617
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
frequencies back open

618
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,420
are also if you're interested in working
on the studio transmitter link project

619
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,150
are were getting tantalizingly close
what we really want to get it down to is

620
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,340
is something that people can just pop to
death you download it pop tests in their

621
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,460
disk drives in

622
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,680
and all the sudden it just works and you
and whenever there's a problem it just

623
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,169
sort of fixes itself

624
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,300
are instead of having to bother your
friends that

625
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,060
that no one except you in the morning
excel in a row in any way

626
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,029
we have a pretty much working but we
just have to get those last thats

627
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,220
reliability to

628
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,440
to the point that it's really gonna
gonna be great so are you become

629
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,000
up to you up to me after if you'd like
to contribute to that project

630
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,710
and I also liked I'd like to comment

636
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,598
so I had a question about Japan I which
is

637
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,020
I how do you get the signal into the van

638
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,099
I from wherever it is and also the run
of 12 altered you

639
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,280
one of love 120 volts it's a

640
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,680
its a.m. use 802 11b BG when he did it

641
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,799
we use hot spots come from alive our
listeners

642
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,910
a pull up to that you want to talk to
businesses in their houses and parked

643
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,618
there

644
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,280
and they run a cable out from their
house our cable

645
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,030
and also we have a of doing it we have
an antenna in their treaty

646
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,510
in the run that down and we're on those
directly into the van we have that we

647
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,160
have about

648
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,899

that'll thank you very much

650
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,630
I yeah this is Frankie from Cleveland
I'm also a license SEC

651
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,380
amateur radio operator and my question
to you is what level of expertise both

652
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,000
electrical engineering wise and maybe
even see ham radio wise do you have any

653
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,430
organization

654
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:08,160
I don't know shit I

655
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,310
that we're not going out on the Hamptons
by 30 let you know what you guys need to

656
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,460
play something other than the grateful
dead so

657
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,310
that's my involvement I tried to get
other people were technically abt

658
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,690
involved in a

659
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,890
so here's the story from someone he
doesn't know anything about what a

660
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,770
transmitter

661
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,960
his you don't need not you end up in
years but interesting I have

662
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,920
you know I started busting and I have no
experience in radio whatsoever

663
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,599
I just decided it was something that
needed to happen now I was basically

664
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,520
just stop that I had been kinda enticed
into getting a license competitor to

665
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,530
wake me by

666
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,970
he's these assholes but NPR immunity

667
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:51,440
and up buddy in mind getting sparky only
after I've been up about two weeks

668
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,780
on the air and any email maybe they had
a you know that time

669
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,270
and he was an RF engineering EE you a
lot

670
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,330
though I think it is really important
that if you're starting a

671
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,890
a pirate radio station to find somebody
who technically adept

672
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:08,799
kept me from putting a very simple out
he kept me from doing anything

673
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,930
it goes stupid stepping in other signals
and taught me a lot about

674
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,009
how to be a good radio status which is
very important

675
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,660
well thank you very much I hope that
maybe all that information from him and

676
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,569
people like him could maybe put the
central repository so that you don't

677
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,190
have to

678
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,359
reinvent the wheel twice in three times
and maybe a dozen times after that

679
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:29,900
thanks very much like any project yeah
with the

680
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,480
I think the communities project in
European traditions guys are doing a lot

681
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,589
of that work actually

682
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:39,680
yeah we were working on some documents
at some point I guess how to set up your

683
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,560
own thing

684
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,830
I don't know if they're done yet or
anything running

685
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:47,049
on actually good will be lower hi there

686
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,320
I asked on: I madrick from Albuquerque
New Mexico

687
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,630
we had a parry a station for almost five
years and about three years ago it got

688
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,099
shut down

689
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:00,210
yet I know but I tell you a lot of the
factors behind that one was

690
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,230
the fact that it was that he was the
local hams that did

691
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,980
most the hunting some to sabotage me and
some the other factors and getting that

692
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,320
nurture

693
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,640
to it really was the FTC guys that were
that the biggest problem though there

694
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,220
was

695
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,910
now because there's no paper trail based
on one or more the members having an FCC

696
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,560
license

697
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,420
unfortunately so that may be a factor
the people getting into this may 18

698
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,500
wanna do it's better to have a clean
slate and I have a record with the FCC

699
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,690
because it makes much easier from start
early springtime screws on

700
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,730
yes yes yet one to one thing about the
hams I'm there are two kinds of scams

701
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,730
their hands like you enhance the don't
like you

702
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,150
and when you first put a transmitter up
you can expect it to be a

703
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,190
long train of trucks come by here

704
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,130
where your transmitter site is they do
this thing called he's hunting

705
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,119
transmitter hunting

706
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,230
it's a hobby do it for fun we're used to
it now whenever you move around you

707
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,410
we're used to seeing them

708
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,649
up up all workers is better some of them
are cool about it

709
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,869
and don't care some of them it pisses
them off we're doing this without a

710
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:04,730
license and they call the SEC in
complaints though that

711
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,650
through but it's really a 50-50 deal
some of my friends on Myanmar

712
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,050
just have to talk to them to figure out
which one they are they're not friends

713
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,710
get the hell away from could be our No 1
during the first

714
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,020
your we have a lot to him friends him

715
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,640
and yes hi

716
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,279
hi this is dusty from WB Russel message
itself just %uh describe your

717
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,339
programming

718
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:31,830
detail are you searching down station

719
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:35,970
now are listed its go Irish so we doing
lunch room

720
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,460
yeah programming the programming here is
I'm completely

721
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,780
reform it it our goal is to it have

722
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,070
a platform for free speech and two play
music that

723
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,280
and people don't here so we have a lot
to local music

724
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,310
Angie girl who's been right here person
played a lot a local band lot about

725
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,680
Eugene you that we really try to focus

726
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,940
on the local community of musicians
bowlers rich

727
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,040
when it comes to local musicians plus
there's a lot of music after that no one

728
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,440
ever hears

729
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,770
bitches simple no one ever hears it and
RDJ are very good at being an end up

730
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:09,890
buying it

731
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:14,710
um so I would be there basically your
rules we call it that Knowles radio net

732
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,810
stepped

733
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,619
that's our program it is no criteria as
far as

734
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:22,770
world were a punk you know three st
where

735
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:26,750
whatever there's nothing like that
basically we find people who are

736
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:30,609
you know friendly to be a the station
program on how to

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,580
of thanks very much next question II Men
in spinning

758
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,270
I said a question I would say I Clear
Channel ever become a threat

759
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:48,160
by broadcasting noise over channel
consecutive patients

760
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,910
transmitters yes it it's funny with
their doctors who

761
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:56,980
6662 just dumb I and me about that we
didn't have somebody stepping on our

762
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,810
channel

763
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:02,440
about 1 to about four months I'm or
months ago and I we tracked it down to

764
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,580
to the local Clear Channel guys guys
upto

765
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,670
was very near their studio and it kept
moving around

766
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:13,650
they say we have no idea what it was we
never were able to catch them but

767
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,240
somebody will

768
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,220
doing it it went on for about two or
three weeks and then it's

769
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,900
yeah he prob Clear Channel head

770
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,630
Jan a typically eighty doin it it very
likely that they would have done

771
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,349
something to try and ap

772
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:31,780
is where ready blockers should

773
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:36,349
for I then they just get bored and go
away

774
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:42,099
and just like a party unity of the same

775
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:47,490
thanks strain yeah I'm soo terrain

776
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,869
as wanna say much

777
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:54,470
debt of gratitude we all people like you
misuse

778
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,830
radio project I think everyone's give
them a round of applause

779
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,619
right now yeah

780
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,890
thank you appreciate and I do a two
quick questions

781
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,200
are 1 do you think the SEC in New York
would react differently than the FCC in

782
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,369
Boulder

783
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:13,589
and there's more than 28 what yeah

784
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:17,400
also I think about it think about your
new york YouTube the Moroccan traffic

785
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,560
what happened

786
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,279
not it and the other question is

787
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,080
bullshit and brought in Boulder just
smile on your face you choose

788
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,869
and I'll tell you the agency will be the
same way they it will be a little bit

789
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:35,180
problem is they are gonna beat up there
is a different channel

790
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,970
some challenges and in New York there's
you know a lot more stations

791
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:44,780
from there in Colorado %um Frank because
I don't have clear channel on

792
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,310
a lil E MU courtney Page Taliban they
don't get to have free rein over their

793
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:49,660
head

794
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,779
their spectrum like like they do out
there so much there's a lot of stations

795
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,050
and there's a lot I am on stations like
WBAI

796
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,250
make s punk rock underground grassroots

797
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,060
not send ground but there's a lot a
community radio out here already

798
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,470
so even trying to signal is gonna be
harder out here

799
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:13,410
and of course I think I think they do
you actually see stem

800
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,920
like how many agents they have based on
population so

801
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,369
thats Tamil you know he works for you
ship loads here yeah I'm not a good

802
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:25,030
enough then you know

803
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:28,160
at I haven't bothered starting yeah

804
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,649
any other quick question is what about
this fourth rules that was mentioned in

805
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:37,359
earlier in the program the withdrawal
the fourth rules

806
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,580
was essentially inciting in and all we
can tell you I'm wide awake and yet you

807
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,380
can stay

808
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,330
I wanna kill the the guy right countries
like everything I've never tell anybody

809
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,089
about the fourth rule

810
00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:54,150
City I between support through like ours
and a fortune

811
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,220
as you really did each okay

812
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,970
and did not yet the they won't hurt you

813
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:05,410
but I in general plus we don't like this
it doesn't matter if you're making a

814
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,069
large

815
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:10,060
matters month just that much

816
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:13,390
rulemaking I mean it doesn't matter if
you're breaking a botch

817
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,009
matters who your not how much you're
getting the mock what the people you're

818
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,390
picking up in you

819
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,618
you really bad people to stop are people
like

820
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:26,450
FBI to protect the president

821
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,310
a you home & Security Administration
know there are people that you really

822
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,940
don't want to stop you really don't want
to give them a reason to comment

823
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,869
but you right I'm but fourth ruled

824
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:41,420
about not being the our time here thank

825
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:46,150
and rock attention from organization

826
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,579
organizations to carry real bed don't
threaten people

827
00:48:49,579 --> 00:48:55,160
don't I try it at Temple just a little
sidebar about that on

828
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,170
at this is this is

829
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,730
self-indulgent but I'm pp this is not
the reasons that I was really attracted

830
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,700
by RIA is because

831
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,980
on it's one of the things that you can
do that just doesn't piss people off

832
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,369
because

833
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:13,400
if you don't wanna listen to it you just
change the channel

834
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,950
rate like you just don't listen to it so
for olive you

835
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,740
hacktivist an activist on people were
like who can I do

836
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,300
you know this is one of the things
that's just its

837
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,730
if you if you have people and friends
and technical people help he said it out

838
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:33,390

840
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,680

yes so congratulations for you guys yeah

849
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:17,950
idea unique week when here

850
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:22,620
are there are other streaming providers
like the one that you guys use in Jersey

851
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,240
that pretty much the only will work I'll
let you eat

852
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,840
in Nandanam world like I said there's a
big

853
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,900
packer you know population in the pirate
radio

854
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,520
it's a subset Anna you know you
everybody has that hacker friend who has

855
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,710
their own hosting company

856
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:43,000
we have a bunch so we just can't trade
off yep

857
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,130
using real easy out there are a lot of
them out there all you have to do is

858
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:46,860
find them in

859
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,240
you know the reality is you don't need
to have a string issued an email

860
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,700
you can run a streaming server in your
studio or your van

861
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,860
streams directly over the Internet out
I'm

862
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:00,600
to the SQL site so in reality if you
want to you can do it without

863
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:06,230
anything other than just you stop very
possible cool we actually got a few more

864
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:06,900
questions

865
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,920
I'll I'm being from

866
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,880
Wichita Kansas and I have snow yes
Ripper said

867
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,840
yeah actually yeah represent a hillbilly
hackers their

868
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,040
a Pato what I have streaming media

869
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,750
video server running right now I'm gonna
have a static IP and stuff

870
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:33,390
my basement and what I was 12 dues for
small want to connect with the guys

871
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,160
after the show

872
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,600
but I've been right I've done running
water task before I came here and it's

873
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,620
working real good

874
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:42,700
the other thing is I'm a friend of mine
that's

875
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:47,480
got a lot of equipment he's got a big
base station these friends for ham

876
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,480
radio people so I think that pride be
beneficial to me

877
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,980
and this is one of my goals is again on
the air I am

878
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:58,030
but the only problem is is at Clear
Channel house

879
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:02,250
lot of power in Wichita they own all the
radio stations

880
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:06,100
there and same and game in Denver and
Boulder

881
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,410
okay arm and the other issue is

882
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:13,589
and when you do get fined and and/or

883
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:17,820

yeah but it's genetic you know what now
here's the tutorial

931
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:19,070
home and look in the mirror and decide
not to live in a

932
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:24,170
few her

933
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:27,870
for more

934
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:31,970
you know why you know why they can't do
them was reading that they can sue them

935
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:36,210
they have a license and by signing onto
that licensee agrees not to do a lot of

936
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,140
certain

937
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,560
up things that they did them they could
be sued for it is

938
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,250
this is weird Minister they can finest
because we don't

939
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:48,280
capitalized for

940
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:52,930
and actually showing my breast right
there for

941
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:57,110
man boobs hit yeah I don't let me just
go over real quick

942
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:00,720
exactly what you have to do you exactly
where they have to catch you to get a

943
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,210
fine you have to be on the air

944
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,970
alright yeah and you have to be on the
air they have to kiss you with your

945
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:05,470
mouth

946
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,700
in Mike you can do with your mouth in
your mic so

947
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,630
because we have a transmitter in a
different place than we have the DJs

948
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,650
that almost impossible be

949
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:19,640
it is it and what the economy is the in
10 transmitter they don't

950
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,270
find where you're at because it's in a
crisis so

951
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,370
it's like almost completely impossible
for

952
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:30,509
a person in the way that we having set
up to get fined

953
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:34,770
so it is it is a danger but its it's
easy to avoid by setting it up

954
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,770
in the correct way %um no answer your
question on a tangent

955
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,860
now because that's what FB the and the
time mining

956
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,450
EDS over boo don't panic I'm honey I
radio

957
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:49,600
basically Eritrea yes campaign fine

958
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:54,220
weekend it wouldn't take it to court
because we don't have money

959
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:58,440
one other thing is do if you're a pirate
station in with them this year

960
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,670
the lineup local on lawyers who are

961
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:05,830
liberal and chance to decide towards
free speech we actually have three

962
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,420
lawyers

963
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,780
in boulder they have volunteer to do pro
bono work for us

964
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,000
really ladies yeah one-on-one

965
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,200
BJ not be more but he was and the

966
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,420
we actually had three lawyers the FTC
only have three lawyers we have more

967
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,580
legal power to me if he does

968
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:25,100
on on going to court in reply

969
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:29,170
the know that in the email me want a
stop in nineteen on tobacco company I

970
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:30,640
got more like legal power than you

971
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,859
layoff and basically it

972
00:57:33,859 --> 00:57:37,540
work as they don't really want to take
you to court because they know that if

973
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,640
we go to court and we win

974
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,470
that that Peter 3 o'clock anything
they've got going to kill them

975
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:47,700
the only thing they have going for them
is the fact that you

976
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,680
think they can stop you they can't

977
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,970
a really truly in so there's no excuse
you should all go home in star decision

978
00:57:55,970 --> 00:58:01,230
now India first

979
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:04,390
you did are 8 cyl week good

980
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:08,040
my question this is the tree again and I
just wanna

981
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,390
make a point which is that if if

982
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:15,609
your station ever got to the I mean the
truth is that the SEC can do all kinds

983
00:58:15,609 --> 00:58:16,819
of things

984
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:20,080
but they really don't because they don't
have the people power to do it

985
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:25,180
right for they can actually if they find
out your name they can find you

986
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:29,040
I for operating a transmitter not for
cursing noper doing anything else

987
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,250
my they can find you for the chance they
also if you too

988
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:36,730
by them after they've gotten got you
into court

989
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,480
they can actually put you in jail but
that's the only time they can put you in

990
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,090
jail

991
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:44,080
and that's never happened bratunac yeah
history well that's never happened

992
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,080
to you guys that happened to Stephen
Donald okay

993
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:51,319
are jealous even better didn't go to
jail no he didn't go to jail but what

994
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,880
they did was they got a are a
restraining order against him

995
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,420
if you went back on the air the only
time you could ever go to jail

996
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,910
well there's two times one is it you

997
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:07,620
are got a restraining order against you
and you defy the restraining order so

998
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,630
you would know before that happened

999
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,350
probably and yet and your peachtree and
the other one point here

1000
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,750
is that you just that's why we don't use
real names ever ever

1001
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,760
ever they can get a restraining order
against Mark

1002
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,760
and the other the other time is if you
happen to be doing something else wrong

1003
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,760
at the moment so like alcohol

1004
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,650
art not did like drugs are being under
18 are having a gun

1005
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:36,850
having a gun but I think I would be
really interesting if you ever did get

1006
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,750
dragged all the way through the court
process because

1007
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:42,800
there's something different about your
station and Stephen donifer station

1008
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,480
which is that you actually applied for a
license you applied for a license on a

1009
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,420
channel

1010
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,960
that the FCC itself believed to be clear

1011
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,280
I at because they put out in the rules
originally the church Anna was clear on

1012
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,810
was OK to apply for

1013
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:01,359
so I think it I think that they would
really dread actually at ever taken to

1014
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,310
you

1015
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,480
take me to court because by their own
standards you don't cause interference

1016
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,120
on your signal

1017
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,330
so are I think it's a it's actually
pretty interested in a very bad case

1018
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,430
against S

1019
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:16,930
if they return so arm one more thing I
have some of our cam bucks

1020
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:20,810
I only have a couple these with me so if
you're really thinking about trying to

1021
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:21,750
nab a station

1022
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:25,350
I cannot give companies also there's
hold on to literature that all

1023
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,810
