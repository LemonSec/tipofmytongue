1
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:07,829
okay saw what happens is this is a
two-step process first we measure the

2
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:08,390
blank

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:13,080
and we can store the profile for later
replication in a database

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,680
in the computer and Dan we can tell it
to me all the blank there's about five

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,259
different

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,840
size is a blanks to basically do any key

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,230
and Saul a little milling head comes out

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,330
and it laterally Mills the blank arm

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,190
most profiles can be copied and lesser
square-cut profiles as shown on the

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,160
right hand side

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,410
it won't do squares and it won't do
protrusions

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:44,200
now the cool thing about this machine is
bad it already you can take a change key

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,700
now think about this in the master key
environment when you can't get the

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,540
blanks this is the problem with this
machine

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,579
if you have access to the machine and
you have access to a change key

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,829
but not a blankie this machine will
replicate the change key and change it

17
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,220
into a blank key so you have no

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,770
access problems for the blank keys this
is why this home after king issue has

19
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,009
become so critical

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,140
and again here's what the blanks look
like

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:21,070
and here's what the cut keys look like
and what it does is it actually samples

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,890
and approximates the words in the lock
so it doesn't

23
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,280
absolutely precisely represent the key

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,720
now what's really cool about this
machine I've been working with the

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,340
manufacture in Germany

26
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,340
there's now software out for this
machine

27
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,830
that you can take a photograph have a
key way

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:46,830
you gotta love science okay

29
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:54,380
saw we take we take a picture out the
keyway

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,110
imported into Adobe Photoshop size it

31
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,840
imported and the easy entry and what you
do I don't know if you can see

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,950
a little bit you actually draw the
keyway

33
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,378
you draw out the way you want it to be

34
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:14,168
and then you stored in a database and

35
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,779
you replicate the keyway and

36
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:21,559
then used now you have a blankie that
fits the lock

37
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:25,689
now you may have some special
requirements let's talk about our

38
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,010
friends at Schley

39
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,209
now this is the database how you store
the profile then you can modify you can

40
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,120
make it thinner you can make it thicker

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,779
you can shop pieces of you can add
pieces you can change sectional key ways

42
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:43,309
in high security environment you can do
whatever you want so here's our friend

43
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:44,590
mister everest

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,139
this is an original everest profile

45
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:53,269
and you can see how the undercut would
prevent a standard blank from

46
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:57,459
entering mackey way which is it's very
clever design and patented

47
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:02,469
an if you're not able to have that
undercut you are getting into that key

48
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,059
way

49
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:08,359
now commerce the the modified profile
and as you can see

50
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:11,769
what I did was I drew around the
undercut

51
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,069
so this is now not a slag avarice blank

52
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,540
this is one little open this lock and
then my friend can Pearson at Peterson

53
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,870
manufacturing that makes the lock picks

54
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,489
he made a little p.m. inserts in the
lock

55
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,769
and raises the check PN so it's very
clever

56
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:33,540
saw imp so that that's basically the
machine

57
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,698
I they have a website easy entry .de if
you want more information on

58
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,139
impression ng notes as I said I

59
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,299
you can open are as I found with a
ballpoint pen

60
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:49,370
I the the locks for the computers

61
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,449
thank God nobody steals computers today
or

62
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,719
or that wouldn't have much effect this
is a formal impression system that's

63
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,760
made by John fall as I mention

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,649
and basically you stick an aluminum foil
carrier into the lock

65
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,069
and in 30 seconds a search Lake I 923
see which Matt talked about

66
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,639
its open and by the way the two books
that Matt talked about

67
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,040
arm written by Hobbs and then there's
another one written by George price

68
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,109
and a are to manipulation are all in the
city

69
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:24,669
okay I and this is what the carrot for
oil carrier looks like after its

70
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:25,680
impression

71
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,240
very clever and you can actually decode
that for carrier

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,430
and come up with the code number for the
key

73
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,479
this is another method have opening for
oil aluminum foil with the temple keys

74
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,639
I like berries gonna show you an
alternate over now to mark

75
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,210
I'm and if we have time at the end we'll
talk about and work a little more

76
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:53,210
thank you

77
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,490
either my name's mark sidon

78
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,650
and I do physical security for a living
break into things

79
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,810
always when authorized are usually a

80
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:28,319
require written permission so I'm not
going to repeat

81
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,430
stuff that these other fine people have
said I'll try to skip over

82
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,660
have way too many slides because I was
invited on the yesterday

83
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,979
I'd like to step back a bit though and
look at the bigger picture here

84
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:43,659
which is not focusing on locks but
focusing on the system issues

85
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,740
locks are just one component which fit
in

86
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,250
into a gestalt which most manufactures
Tony mother

87
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,139
understand the users who install also
don't bother to understand the context

88
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:58,729
in in which the lock or the things
around

89
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:03,030
are installed so this fits in a much
bigger context

90
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,949
a physical security I am which

91
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,060
has been getting smaller and smaller
since 911

92
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,250
am hands a number of

93
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,409
features emerge in the enterprise
environment the business environment

94
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,050
have been reducing physical security
specifically for example

95
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,620
reliance on external parties outsourcing
and offshore development that means

96
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,169
you're depending on all the and
colocation sites

97
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:31,520
this means you're depending on all these
external people to do the security for

98
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:31,930
you

99
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,900
rather than doing it yourself I'm even

100
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,190
in the enterprise if you work in a
business you'll discover there's

101
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,610
fragmented responsibility and authority

102
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,550
between sysadmins networking and legal
and facilities

103
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,699
and often their multiple sites editor
their different people in different

104
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:49,509
locations

105
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:53,599
they have responsibility for stuff and
there's a lot of gaps between these

106
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,190
competing on parties so stuff or just
fall into the cracks

107
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,240
there's very little budget for mediation

108
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,969
older facilities problems with older
facilities like locks that were

109
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,389
installed thirty-five years ago

110
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,000
om mostly the risk management mindset is
insurance oriented

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,370
you know where we stand to lose had we
buy insurance to

112
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,500
pass for lost covers for the loss

113
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,870
another problem is that the the
facilities people who have lotsa

114
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,889
functional power

115
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:26,020
they have this keyring which can open
anything have very little status

116
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,620
so they might be in a queue instead in a
locked office

117
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,900
moreover they have very little

118
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,958
training in how to make buying decisions
so

119
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:40,140
the vendors selling snake or products
that don't work very well

120
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:46,420
meanwhile almost no solutions are open
source it's really hard to evaluate

121
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,479
what the vendor product or unless you're
somebody like Tobias

122
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,870
are you guys book an ace

123
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,790
see I'm employees cell other problem is
man has pointed out that the strongly

124
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,579
believe in security through obscurity

125
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:07,410
their common cop outs rationalizations
excuses are that's not my job

126
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,980
it's my vendors problem i'm concerned. a
plausible threat

127
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,000
we just have to do a little bit better
than locks and keys we have to raise the

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,380
bar just a few inches

129
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:23,380
so they'll go to our neighbors in a
campus or a building

130
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,500
there's a lot lot a legacy to deal with
for example partial hi

131
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
walls unsealing raised floor

132
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,470
wiring rooms in the wrong places like in
the hallways why run through public

133
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,220
areas

134
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,290
doors that were installed thirty years
ago locks that arms installed

135
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,880
now at least you can ask yourself in the
physical security world

136
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,220
is there a perimeter you can ask that in
the network in context anymore

137
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,220
cause a wireless then there are in the
physical security world they're also

138
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,230
these back doors and I don't mean

139
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,640
the physical back toward plant where the
people got site smoke

140
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,170
that is one of them there's also the
Knox box

141
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,849
it's this this little box that sits on
the side of your building and has the

142
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,860
keys inside it

143
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,930
and there's a single key that although
firefighters

144
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,050
and police officers have that opens at
Knox

145
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,440
Knox box and they take out the curing
which opens the inside

146
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,620
so if they need to get in case of
emergency

147
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,610
they had thats what you call in computer
science a single point of failure

148
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,670
the Knox box is usually protected by a
medico camp

149
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,349
another physical security problem in
campuses are buildings

150
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,350
is the local operating networks that is
the building control

151
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,920
is on a network itself usually runs on
power lines or some other kind of

152
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,650
network in often these things are
connected with the enterprise network

153
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,520
sometimes these things also controlled
doors marks

154
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,959
multi-tenant buildings are special
problem because they have shared

155
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,199
infrastructure

156
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:01,319
and there's a lowest common denominator
factor the comes in because the weakest

157
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,170
10 and security policy

158
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,229
probably is your key factors security
policy

159
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,949
if they let anybody in anybody can walk
up to your front door

160
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:15,199
soco location facilities are one of my
favorites I'm often higher to test

161
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,800
the security colas and these are like 80
communities

162
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,150
except when the motorcycle gangs in down
the street

163
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,680
you lost all your security your co
tenants weakest visitor inventor policy

164
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,480
puts you at risk

165
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,010
so let's get out components now there
are things like doors

166
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,439
which are made of what are they single
or double doors where the hinges

167
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,319
sometimes are on the outside sometimes
you can just take in japan's of the

168
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:41,370
doors

169
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,970
than their locks part near the ends this
is in

170
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,779
a PowerPoint wonderfulness all these
guys talk about locks

171
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:53,850
a few amusing problems with blocks are
that the best-selling tubular locks late

172
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,120
have deadlock urs which are rendered
ineffective by the biggest selling

173
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,540
electric strikes

174
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,140
these are often install together and the
deadlock or just slips into the gap

175
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,470
behind the electric strike so you can
just

176
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,829
push back the bolt the deadlock it
doesn't work

177
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:13,029
I frequently see exposed electric strike
wiring

178
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,620
outside the protected area magnetic
strikes which are those things with the

179
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,740
big magnets

180
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,779
not on a trip to power and its

181
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:23,980
little realized that adhesive tape on
the magnetic strike

182
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,640
were you know any kind of coding reduces
the holding strength dramatically

183
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,990
according to an interest you block man
had to mathematics laughed at a map

184
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,339
next now so key blocks

185
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,490
are often installed even on doors
controlled by badge access control

186
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,730
so you have a parallel weaker system by
which you can get through

187
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,760
and often nobody knows who has the key
to the key blocks

188
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,839
on the magnetic on the

189
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,170
on the doors controlled by the badge
access system so

190
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,930
I won't talk about any of these lock
cylinder issues cuz everybody else has

191
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,709
except for interchangeable core Saunders

192
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,699
interchangeable course owners have a
special key call the control key

193
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,689
which you can use to remove the core and
replace it with the different core

194
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:13,689
in other words Ricky the lock how
quickly the problem is that the control

195
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:14,260
key is

196
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,319
often even more universal that any
master key

197
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:22,860
there's one control key for the whole
system and you can make control key with

198
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,319
one

199
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:26,510
instanceof a lock 1 comment on mark's

200
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,279
I A description out master up systems
that

201
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,290
avoid the master key vulnerability the
mat described

202
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,430
is that you can still take apart any
instanceof

203
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,660
any of these locks and figure out what
the cyber combination is

204
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,290
so mean it leaves a trace there's a hold
story some

205
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,750
lock is to Spears maybe a padlock is
walked off

206
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,360
but you still only need one lakh to
reverse engineer the entire system

207
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,939
mark let me just by let me just make one
comment

208
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:01,319
that's true if one side bar code is used
in the whole system

209
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:05,180
that is not true as I sad

210
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,559
if there's multiple side bar codes that
medical an awesome I have the capability

211
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,230
of development for generating

212
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,189
which no other system does if you take a
target lock

213
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:19,150
with a different side bar code and what
you're going after you are gone open

214
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,920
okay that's the problem thank you the
real problem with physical ox is that

215
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,600
revocation

216
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,920
rights is unacceptably difficult and
expensive I want I learned to pick locks

217
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,220
a calm university in the nineteen
sixties so that

218
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,209
work for the radio station there and we
wanted to report on kids getting

219
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,870
beat up by cops on campus and we didn't
want to get beaten up for church ask

220
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,819
ourselves

221
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:43,920
so I make keys to the tunnels under the
campus in the

222
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,000
the building so we the radio station
could report on what's going on

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,339
went back for my twenty-fifth cops are
you going on in other words you.re

224
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:54,750
terrorist that's running I was a
terrorist but now I was like Les

225
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,130
Miserables grandpa

226
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,160
terrace cell

227
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,839
when I went back for my twenty-fifth
reunion guess what my tunnel keys and my

228
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:04,170
friend turkeys the building's

229
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:11,170
still worked twenty-five years later

230
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,000
so this is just a demonstration that
revocation a bright too seldom

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,190
if ever done because it's enormously
expensive so what we use instead

232
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,149
we use computer access batch systems so
this computer nerd

233
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:26,769
database involved I could hear you
saying 0

234
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:30,600
its wired somehow to microcomputer based
panels local caches

235
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,810
access rights and these things used to
be connected on local wiring point to

236
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,769
point wiring

237
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,779
but now they've networked it all how the
network did they put these

238
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,339
Lantronix terminal controllers in front
of it the use

239
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,519
bogus proprietary protocols they seldom
use mutual authentication

240
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,850
on the counter parties in any
transaction so you can do man millet

241
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,630
accident sniffing attacks

242
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,000
and these are the things that open the
doors that control the doors

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,009
if they're on your enterprise network
your baby basically lost the game

244
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:05,759
the manufactures leavin back doors for
the installers and the maintainers and

245
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,079
maybe others

246
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,459
and they don't document any the only way
you could find his back doors is by

247
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:12,459
researcher

248
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:15,699
and then there are these cards which
light %um procs carts

249
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:19,529
an early example of RFID tags they have
a short number

250
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,160
which is sent by RF to the reader and
these can be read remotely by an

251
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,930
attacker while you're in the elevators
and we can walk up to you

252
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,220
with the battery powered reader in re
the card in your wallet maybe if you

253
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,750
have to it would be difficult

254
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,500
but you only have one card in your
wallet they can read them some these are

255
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,250
feel programmable see can generate your
own cards

256
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,209
the low card numbers have problems and
brute force attacks are possible

257
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:44,069
although I don't know a brute forcing
machine yet are these more secure than

258
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,750
keyes

259
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,980
me so here's a case study that I did
with March and had a financial

260
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,440
institution where

261
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,459
we decided it would be fun to break into
the badging system

262
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:57,990
which would gain as access to everything
else I won't

263
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,389
name the vendor on the tape arm

264
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,000
but the system was running SCO UNIX on a
PC with

265
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,980
basically all the services turned on
serial wiring to cart stations

266
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:14,079
root password was published in the user
manual R 00 T

267
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,770
when we call tech support and said why
did you publisher and password they said

268
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,908
you want to change that you know that
could create

269
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,419
big service problems for for us we can
support you

270
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,929
dialup modems which they also
recommended always be left on

271
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:33,139
so of course I logged on his route and
start poking around

272
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:37,570
it was listening for TCP connections and
21 ports

273
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,918
the sources on the machine it was open
source but not because they believed in

274
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,370
open source it was for their convenience

275
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,470
so they could compile in features and so
I was looking at if def check waihee

276
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,649
if TF US House

277
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:53,880
I was starting to get alarmed

278
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,360
other if tests included LDS Church

279
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,139
GE King of Prussia which I think makes
nuclear gadget search engines or

280
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:02,399
something

281
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:06,220
University Washington corning US Senate

282
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,669
here is a Southern California Yale
University Medical Center

283
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,090
and five airports by name all the
British Airports

284
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,850
and their customers included 50 airports
prisons all the state

285
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,310
correctional institutions in
pennsylvania I was visualizing musical

286
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,230
cells

287
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,370
at midnight we'll just open all the cell
doors and see what happens

288
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,850
so looking at the database schema was
really instructive because the system

289
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,320
has this concept the passkey magic word

290
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,780
you type that the car terminal and it
conveys ferries privileges it's like a

291
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,550
password but without a log

292
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,629
in all these things are in a database
table lightly obfuscated

293
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:44,659
so of course we extracted the passwords

294
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:48,780
and we noticed there was a special pass
keys a magic function up-to-date

295
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,060
which conveyed system manager privilege
to anyone who knew how to

296
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,840
computed secret just type in this number
and boom you were

297
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,240
the superuser this was not document

298
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,790
so person attacked her could do anything
including musical cells

299
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,820
create stealth badges alter code I'll

300
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,210
you know disable the locking mechanism
remove /url to log records

301
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,700
there are general problems with sensors
& alarms

302
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,980
which I don't have time to talk about on
par equal won't have time to dem

303
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,240
won't talk about video video has its
pluses and minuses

304
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,120
particularly may discover this when the
PN have your ATM card

305
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,879
is sniffed by someone who was installed
a surreptitious video camera pointed at

306
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:34,780
the keyboard

307
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,330
and has put an overlay card reader on
the on the ATM

308
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,050
I'll just talk about this caucasian case
study I was hired to

309
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,310
test security a at a big coehlo up

310
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,280
one run by publicly held company with
faults the call the vaults

311
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,200
cages and cabinets on a raised floor but
the raised floor

312
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,590
was the plan for the cool air which
would flow through the race for

313
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,639
go through vents in the vault go up into
the ceiling

314
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,100
so basically this was just an enclosed
area within open floor

315
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,310
an open ceiling

316
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,629
naturally you could go over the ceiling
or under the floor

317
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:16,629
but they said we have we are passive
infrared sensors

318
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:20,950
were protected by motion sensors
intervals so I decided to test

319
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,500
I submarine under the floor popped up
waved at the motion sensor

320
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,110
twenty minutes later nothing happened

321
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,389
so I walked out the door and I wave to
the camera

322
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:37,669
put up a sign saying bust me

323
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:42,480
nothing happened I walked out the door
with a PC

324
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,169
matter how to get in the first place I
walked in the back door and the bosnian

325
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:48,080
because I had a legitimate looking batch

326
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,840
which I had forged

327
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,970
so its it of course what you find out

328
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,840
is that the motion sensor is for their
conveniences it's a request to exit

329
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,678
sensor

330
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,990
it shuts the switch on the door that
enables you to leave without setting off

331
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,909
the alarm

332
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:08,120
if you force the door on the way in it
would set off the alarm

333
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,710
but if you're walking out no alarm

334
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,169
so they didn't ask himself the question
how could somebody getting the space

335
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:20,879
with nobody n church there's been nobody
in the space for 48 hours but sadly

336
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,300
there's movement in the space

337
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,340
is not normal well no because they have
no integration between the

338
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,418
motion-sensing

339
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:33,450
and the access control in the alarm the
role disintegrated systems

340
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,480
identity I'll just leave you with one
thought X thought question

341
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,179
which is the last bullet here is it
better for your call I'll

342
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,950
to accept your driver's license 40 issue
you their own credential

343
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:50,990
containing a shared secret or check your
face in a database

344
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,230
in my claim is that private credentials

345
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,419
are much better these days because
anybody can make drivers license

346
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,440
like this guy who forged

347
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,040
the identity this is Abraham a dollar
who pled guilty

348
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,210
to some to some number large number of
councils

349
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,669
forging the identities of 211 at the
fortune 400 richest people

350
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:18,340
a few years ago the USGA are also

351
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,060
has been doing experiments on front
driver's licenses they determined

352
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,639
that if you fill out this form which
s/he questions like are you a fugitive

353
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:28,149
from justice

354
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:31,200
are you subject to court order
restraining you from

355
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,200
harassing stalking or threatening or

356
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,909
have you ever been adjudicated mentally
defective

357
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:41,350
if you answer these questions yes well
the

358
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,700
then you can't get it but if you answer
them all know and you have a driver's

359
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,870
license or have something that looks
like a valid driver's license

360
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,090
with which you can make using stuff on
eBay you can buy stuff like this

361
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,770
in the five states with minimum brady
law enforcement the reason why

362
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:58,970
years they look up your driver's license
in a database

363
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:05,970
and if they don't get hit that must be a
good guy

364
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,610
they don't look up the driver's license
to determine if it's valid they look it

365
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,110
up to determine if it has the name of a
known criminal

366
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,549
what's wrong with this picture here just
two more scary devices which will

367
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:21,230
underscore why physical security is
important they're keystroke staffers

368
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:25,240
you can buy them frontera under 100
dollars out catalogs on the Internet

369
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,760
and the store about half a megabyte a
key strokes

370
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,120
this is why passwords are completely
obsolete technology people should not

371
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,990
use them

372
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,000
for high value transactions

373
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,450
on I'm Way at a time very

374
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:46,450
okay

375
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:51,949
okay then

376
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,380
last 30 minutes

377
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,780
I'm going to do some demos and then

378
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,720
hopefully some people can ask questions
as well the

379
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,050
s many people have you know I'm Germano
the Dutch

380
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:09,960
for group 2 which is filled with 3 O's
stands for the open organization of luck

381
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,480
because

382
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,500
and we kiddingly say that the 30 stand
for you have to practice

383
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,170
over and over and over again to become
any good at lockpicking

384
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,800
which really is true I mean at this
moment I'm

385
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,030
very very busy with my business which is
the crib the phone

386
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,760
that's where I spend most of my time

387
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,760
I'm the signing a secure phone which

388
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,730
looks like this it's it's an open

389
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,630
or or the source code is available of
this phone we tried to make a iphone

390
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,020
that isn't typeable and a secure as
possible by publishing the source and is

391
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,929
really takes up a lot of my time so

392
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:56,270
a.m. unfortunately I've not be involved
in lockpicking

393
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:00,679
for the last two years as much as I
would like to unfortunately

394
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,000
a lot of people from Germany and even
some from France have

395
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,309
help me collect some nice tricks for you
to show

396
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:10,399
and actually to follow up of what I did
two years ago

397
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,040
the video did I did two years ago with
Michael sitting over there

398
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,059
a.m. exist

399
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:21,720
is still available online it's being
downloaded the lots its its downloadable

400
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,470
for free

401
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,400
if you go to website if you go to our
website www

402
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,040
tool .nl with 3 O's tooo held up to now

403
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,139
you'll find the link to the free
download of

404
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,169
all the things that we did last year

405
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:39,650
and that included the electoral pick
that included the formal dimple

406
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,370
impression

407
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:44,120
that included a lot of things until now
focus

408
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,790
to some other things that we've been up
to one other things is that

409
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,940
we're being recognized more and more as
a serious party is a serious player

410
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,630
by the look industry for instance we
have found a severe

411
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,059
very extreme severe a vulnerability in
in a lock

412
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:06,760
that I will demonstrate now a.m. I
promised the guys that

413
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,740
made the locked in the manufacture date
II would put a little table for their

414
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,950
brand name because

415
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:18,840
how because there are still a few

416
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,760
a small number of these locks around but
what actually happened is that

417
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,780
from somebody came into the

418
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,610
to the tools sport evening and said well
you know here's this

419
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,750
denies lock and tears to key and

420
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,790
all this of course works in operates
a.m.

421
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,690
but he found that if you insert a blank
key

422
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,690
and you turn it into you put it into
block you put pressure on it

423
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,970
you take it out but to leave to tippin

424
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:57,970
weekly the little bit its open now

425
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,330
this this happened at a evening that
mister tobias was

426
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,879
at was worse visiting Austin doing a
lecture on March 2 keying

427
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,580
and you know we'll look at look at each
other and he said well you know there's

428
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,020
just a a lucky combination of beans

429
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,450
and a it's it's a one thing go but then

430
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,890
we thought about it some more and we
discovered that it actually was a

431
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,800
vulnerability

432
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,340
that to apply to all the locks to
complete series of locks ever made in

433
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:27,950
the Serie

434
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,220
a and and we figured out what happens a

435
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,720
the the factory dads manufactures these
locks actually

436
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,430
din manufacture all of it they only did
a part of it what happened is that they

437
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,560
bought the locks

438
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,090
from a cheaper manufacture and when they
got the looks they were completely

439
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:50,050
assembled but they were filled with all
the a combination

440
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,270
beings three so the the bins would be
all at the same length

441
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,190
3 3333 and they would have a blankie
that looks like

442
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,210
that that's got a little bit deeper a.m.
that would be a whole line

443
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,920
of lady sitting there with a pink it am

444
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,310
they would insure turkey the in they
wouldn't hurt the blank with 23

445
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,310
turn the plug a 180 degrees

446
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,679
remove the blog a.m. rekey

447
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,080
the pins with a new combination for
inches 157

448
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,179
53 a.m. and put it back in now

449
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,520
so far there is no vulnerability but
what happened is that the factory that

450
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,570
sold the locks

451
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,360
used bins the the pinch of a diameter of
2.2 millimeters

452
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,460
and they replaced the low pins

453
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,570
with bins of 2.0 millimeters which means

454
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,990
that they are actually more thin so the

455
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,830
the pins that that the key Duchess are
more thin

456
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,110
than the bins that are on top of it so
if you turn it a little bit if you put a

457
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,760
little

458
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,330
tension on it a.m. the gap that normally
is 2.3 millimeters

459
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,810
goes to 2.0 millimeters and the pin

460
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:04,379
that's two point three millimeters
cannot fall down anymore

461
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,410
so a I i phone to factory and I said
well you know you have a serious problem

462
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,970
and eight couldn't believe it they said
well you know it it cannot be that with

463
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,650
a blank

464
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,700
everybody can open these key within

465
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,730
two seconds without any training and and

466
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,990
remember no physical evidence is is
there i mean when I pick a lock

467
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,179
I make scratches in the lock and if you
sent a pic block to a forensic

468
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:33,050
laboratory which the German sport
troopers got some experience with the

469
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:37,070
the German forensic laboratory are stiff
they could pick some locks

470
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,460
and examen demand and they could
actually quite detailed explain

471
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,250
this locus picked with an electric big
this is done by hand isn't been picked

472
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:46,800
at all

473
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,310
but with this technique nobody would
ever find out so somebody could

474
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,120
rub your complete house and the you know
you really have tough luck because

475
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,679
there's nobody who can prove

476
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,150
that you didn't lose a key or problems
like that

477
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:05,370
so did that gave us quite some credit to
the industry especially since

478
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,700
we came to them you know we could have
gone to the 8 o'clock news or

479
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,890
whatever I make a big fuss out a bit but
we didn't do that

480
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,530
we tried to be the good guys this is
such a serious vulnerability

481
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,620
that you know we we we tried to

482
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,890
and and they immediately close to
factory and the

483
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,910
it took them three days in a weekend to
think

484
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,870
what was the best strategy and a got all
the locks back from the shop

485
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,000
and that's a crime you know david now
its

486
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,600
they did they handled it well I

487
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,050
okay then about the lockpicking itself

488
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:43,070
from I could explain how lockpicking
works don't know if there's a need for

489
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,020
that time many people would like me to
explain in detail

490
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,580
why lockpicking as possible and in
howard's can be done because

491
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,050
it's been told many many times before
and I will be downstairs at the second

492
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:54,669
floor

493
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,800
between 2&5 as a leader three hours

494
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,820
teaching everybody wants to to pick
locks

495
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,080
as mark sets a.m. we have

496
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,679
designed a special its already a
collector's item

497
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,610
a special picture normally the pic sets
that people carry

498
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:17,950
a.m. you know our extremely helpful with
all sorts of impressive looking

499
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,810
tools but the thing is for look picking
you only needs

500
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,440
actually one tool or two well you always
need a pensioner

501
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,700
and something called the finger or or
the lifter and

502
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,510
the this a specific one we made as got
to

503
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:37,680
different dance and this will open if
you spend enough time practicing

504
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,660
this will help you open I'm I don't dare
to say exactly how many percent but I

505
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,150
would say

506
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:47,170
eighty percent of the of the locks
around you without any problem

507
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,220
as long as you practice because the
tools don't open the locks

508
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,350
you do you open the lock 'em

509
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:59,140
okay so if you want to learn to pick
locks just come downstairs between 2&5

510
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,770
tomorrow morning there's going to be a
lockpick championship will put a nice

511
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,970
a reward on that will put a nice prize
on the

512
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:13,420
mmm okay water I'm not exactly sure
about the time yet

513
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,870
so okay we got fifteen minutes

514
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,470
okay well I brought a whole lot of
things to demonstrate

515
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,490
but since we're running little bit out
of time

516
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,490
I we're going to bump key the bump key

517
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:31,570
as mark already explained is a is a key
that is cuts

518
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,379
to its lowest position sometimes it even

519
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,770
got a little bit below its lowest
position a

520
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,910
and what it what happens is that if you
insert it into the lock

521
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:47,880
if you insert it into the lock

522
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,110
of course it will not turn because the
pins are not in the right position

523
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:55,330
what do you do if you take out one click

524
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,370
so you remove it a little bit and then
you hit it

525
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:06,370
I I'm not sure if I'm can do this on
camera

526
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:22,740
demonstration effect

527
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:33,980
open okay

528
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,759
now I was first shown this technique was
first shown to me

529
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,879
a actually with a key in the lock in in
Germany by some of my good friends at

530
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:44,440
the

531
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,470
those for trying to this property a and
and that their

532
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,309
the they become really good at it and
the nice thing about this technique

533
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:56,389
is that it can be used on locks like
this one a.m.

534
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:59,730
I'm not sure if you can see

535
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,820
but the keyway of this locket and Eva
lockers extremely narrow

536
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,129
it's almost impossible to even get a
tool in

537
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,760
because is Ward its all over the place
is going six ek

538
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,639
it's really extremely difficult a but
luckily

539
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,829
with the bump key you know it's no
problem at all or at least

540
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:22,030
takes a few blows to to open it if it
blows in

541
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,819
to turn that's open so just takes a
little

542
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:30,649
a little practice the 22 to do it and as
I told you I didn't have much time to

543
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:31,199
practice

544
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,260
a mmm now Mike my good friend all a
pretty decent from Germany

545
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,810
explain to me that this could also be
done with the dimple keys

546
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,949
with the high secure a locks

547
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:47,339
so but he also found that if you pull
back one

548
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:51,739
full notch a.m. that it doesn't work
well so what he does is

549
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,079
he cuts to quiche or he cuts the cuts

550
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:58,510
in the key a a little bit more to the
tip of the key

551
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,930
to I am and and and this will give you
more space

552
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:05,368
a and teammates with some

553
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,680
with a hot glue stick from from a glue
gun

554
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,910
he made a what he calls a buffer and
what happens issue

555
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,240
inserted in the locked and you have a
little bit of play

556
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,910
but you cannot push it in you

557
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,560
cannot push it in too deep you can only
put it in a little while to a little bit

558
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:31,560
and I'll see if I can open this one
making tension

559
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:46,349
table

560
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:15,260
okay to open

561
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,190
now but but this is what I mean with a

562
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,300
if it wasn't with the help from from my
friends have Germany and France

563
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,520
I wouldn't be able to show you all
districts because I really don't have

564
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,670
that much time to really go into you
know

565
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,940
nights and nights of playing with all
these things a.m.

566
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,200
I i hope to do it the better a better
repair job

567
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,670
maybe next time a some trick from France
them

568
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,859
the mmm their is a

569
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,940
breed Garlock and debris Carlo kisses
special

570
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,550
that the key itself has got a.m.

571
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,740
two rows of pins next to each other

572
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,750
I don't know if you can see it but it's
it's a very sophisticated system

573
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,180
and of course you will probably never
see every car look because she's French

574
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,930
and the yup but but in in in but but but
but in france

575
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,759
a you know this is really a very
expensive high security lock

576
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,660
and to pick it it's it's almost
virtually impossible because of these

577
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,700
two rows of pins and it's very difficult

578
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,910
but my good friend gmail somebody a.m.

579
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:26,170
he East thinking a lot about a look
security

580
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:31,180
any thought well it must be possible to
make some sort of impression ink system

581
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,200
and this is Mark already put out with to
its

582
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,200
a formal tape you can make some
impression existence but with this look

583
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,550
that seems not to work so what he did
was used

584
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,060
packaging material this this phone me
like stuff

585
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,270
and he made a blank which

586
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,770
is made out of two parts: actually I'm

587
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,730
this is it uncut so you can move
departure and he

588
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,300
sticks in this packaging material and

589
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,530
it's really amazing but it really works

590
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:09,530
at least I hope it does now

591
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,490
hmm

592
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:34,490
demonstration effect kicking in

593
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:38,259
nomogram okay

594
00:38:38,259 --> 00:38:42,740
gonna removed from the camera

595
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,570
yes okay so while you doing I have a
quick question

596
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,059
what kinda block do you have on your
door

597
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:54,279
okay the the reason the

598
00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:57,059
what what was also my daytime job is

599
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:01,980
the making sure the physical security of
the space around the crib the phone area

600
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,529
I mean we were making secure phones do
to keep the bad guys out but these bad

601
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:08,650
guys have almost unlimited resources

602
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,609
so the thing is II need to be at the

603
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:17,299
the state-of-the-art level of making
sure that nobody enters our building

604
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:22,099
without without them compromising our
computers or decisions that we work on

605
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:26,690
a.m. summer going to tell you I

606
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,789
okay so funny its ok hun

607
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:34,299
its stunning but I can tell you that

608
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:40,089
the love computer securities is involved
it's not only a mechanical system we use

609
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:43,839
I can tell a little bit it's funny I am

610
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,109
know if you want to

611
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:52,940
if you wanna harass us with questions
please you up at the microphone

612
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,589
arm in the Senate where William few
minutes left but

613
00:39:56,589 --> 00:40:00,420
want to yell at us with with questions
or

614
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,099
just say harassing comment 2011 real
good a

615
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:08,410
secure lock system uses by %uh blood
a.m.

616
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:12,038
its it it works with discs

617
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:15,869
and I did open a couple of this clocks
the

618
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:20,700
last time from from others but this is
actually much more sophisticated it's

619
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,539
got a double

620
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,299
locking bar and if I was to recommend
locks it would probably be

621
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:30,279
medico m3 a South feet then and

622
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:33,910
apply systems because these are really
the high secure

623
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,140
systems okay

624
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,170
if you have a question yeah question
about the %uh pumpkin method

625
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,339
does our government jordy it locks yeah
its it works on on

626
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:47,869
amazingly amount of blocks the only
thing is

627
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:52,609
you needs time to practice you really
you know if you think you can open any

628
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:55,288
luck with three strikes with the first
time you try it

629
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,430
you're wrong but if you practice with
its

630
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:02,299
you can open large amount of locks did

631
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:05,349
it works the same assess big on it
elevates the bins up

632
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:08,990
and it's it's a timing matter as well so
you need to strike

633
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,900
weights a fraction of a second and then
turn if you turn be

634
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,059
at the moment the the two-strike you not
gonna open it its

635
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:20,559
it's really a timing matter it is really
something and other

636
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,500
he likes it better that is tend to work
on our to the style the locker

637
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,600
wise as I said the the medicos

638
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,040
a suffi- 10 dispersed luck with the
sidebar

639
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:36,420
and %ah blood completely resistance
against it it works on a bright idea

640
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,119
blocks

641
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,660
but some padlocks works on door locks
had worked on them

642
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:46,140
amazing amount of books thank you
welcome my friend Mike

643
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,629
their home first of British Gas

644
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,930
but the the one thing that I think
mister tobias a festering

645
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:59,480
don't you don't even really touched on
the

646
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,600
the fact that locks are one of the
weakest links in all security networking

647
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,240
country the drywall go over the walls
are under as he said I am

648
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,500
in just that in the general feeling that
now

649
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,570
considering that when we talk about

650
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,860
this like a terrible with this year not
like a terrible weakness there

651
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,920
as a whole security wide thing you
really feel the lock is that important

652
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,050
to the scary jane yes it is yes

653
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,240
it still is a point of attack everyone

654
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,750
one advantage is that from the attackers
pointed you attack the lock you up

655
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:36,490
leave very little forensic evidence so
one property in the lockers was punching

656
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:37,820
a hole through the drywall

657
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,650
is that you don't discover the attack
until much later

658
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,720
on am so know that's why one reason the
locks are important to study in

659
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,270
themselves but absolutely true abusers
as part of a larger system

660
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,280
and if you're concerned with securing
something you have to look at everything

661
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,550
you really want defense in depth which
means locks alarms

662
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:01,000
video everything the key distribution is
often a problem

663
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,070
if you can find the facilities guys left
the key in the coffee cup

664
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,980
well and then you impression then you
have forever entry

665
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,760
so it's not the lock that's the problem
it's the way the keys are stored

666
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,060
a

667
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,160
want the questions I have focuses more
on the

668
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,560
kinda fight some the automotive cars
where you had the

669
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,410
the microchip embedded within the key
system now

670
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:32,810
as far as the additional then regarding
liked numbers are there something else

671
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,060
needed to

672
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:40,310
activate the chip so that lock turns
bunch of different kinds of those

673
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,009
some of them are really unsophisticated
on the earlier ones that

674
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:50,640
that computer chip turned out to just be
a resistor and with with with fifteen or

675
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,870
sixteen different values

676
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:55,490
actually that was pretty out pretty it's
a pretty good system that still out

677
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:55,760
there

678
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,430
was it easy and it works but some have
charged response these days

679
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,480
so they really transponders with RFID
child responses very sophisticated

680
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,120
solve the problem is you can tell what
it is by the way why do you wanna steal

681
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,910
cars

682
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:16,170
actually something about a friend of
mine who have misplaced want this keys

683
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:19,370
and since I about orkut British Treasury

684
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,020
heil 500 bucks for a place to keep from
GM mami

685
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,590
yeah well

686
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:30,000
I'm not sure why you wanted to pride
those good people GM

687
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,290
their five hundred dollars replacement I
we have a couple minutes

688
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,290
self please actually

689
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:42,290
in addition to his that's the Texas
Instruments terrorist system

690
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,670
that they're using challenge response
based are ideas actually

691
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,200
to ask you about that last question
because I have to be out of your

692
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,780
fortune speed pass system uses the exact
same technology

693
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,580
have any view going into any sort of
analysis up this you can look at a

694
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,750
farmer's list

695
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,830
interesting people there is there's
recently been a thread

696
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:07,340
on easy pass pass pass how it works it's
basically a very simple are

697
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,570
I have the equipment to read them down
in my room right now again I have the

698
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:13,540
equipment to read them down in my room
right now i cant send me an e-mail

699
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,450
largess

700
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:18,860
ok I'll a good point let each take a
parting one-sentence parting shot

701
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,500
are just a between we have to be out
here right now

702
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,990
okay well thank you very much and I hope
to see you at the second floor between

703
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,270
two and five today

704
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,210
and tomorrow thank you very much
