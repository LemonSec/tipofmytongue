1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,240
Federation trade unions so %ah the a

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,229
I think that were part of the Soviet
Union I don't know how much rubles are

3
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:08,570
worth these days and

4
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:11,759
wiki actually get for that but my
feeling is

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,010
very little mom some in the intelligence
that a

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,800
the got for me is like the reference it
here at the bottom it says

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,390
McGuckin has been identified as a key
figure in P tag I think that's from that

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,830
the guy who is tree lover it

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,270
lol dot com %um feel free to send him a
message if you want

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,650
a

11
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,489
it was just pick one

12
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,760
and I think it was luve

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,710
ER at AOL dot com

14
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,470
but probably not use any more right

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,589
there's another example of a quote from
a I don't know what meeting there in

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,280
that they got this but at the Bonham

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,290
right here and keeps wanting you had a
million dollars bail

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,479
as meet Siemens indicating that active
members

19
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,850
active as the its coalition to unleash
power on were arrested that they would

20
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:11,659
not give their knee

21
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,890
real names instead their use code such
as Mary cheesecake

22
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:18,549
know what meeting this cozy in India

23
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:21,719
what why he picked this out I have no
idea

24
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,159
but a I thought I was pretty hilarious
that he used this

25
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:28,990
can you are also the

26
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,318
the use of this information to justify
reading a public warehouse

27
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,149
in West Philadelphia later on in the
wind a include singers

28
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:41,859
no pp 22 PVC pipes that were like one
inch thick and

29
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:46,100
I don't think you can actually uses a
lockbox a lockbox is divisive protesters

30
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,569
used to box pizza

31
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:51,359
in civil disobedience did you gonna play
the tape

32
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,840
end zone

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,340
everybody has a right to protest

34
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,159
spectacle delegates became by never

35
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,590
they were pretty disturbed

36
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,320
now just to give you an idea of how
organize these protesters or when we got

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,609
on the scene we were handed this

38
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,550
news media checklist it had a couple
questions the first one saying

39
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,350
have you photographed the weirdest
looking protesters so that you can

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,760
discredit the whole movement

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,269
well this is not the house talking
outside we showed up

42
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:33,550
you can just to cut it off here yes
those the wrong clip

43
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,870
sorry about that some tactical to
difficulties on

44
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,420
the rated this warehouse they rested 70
protesters inside

45
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,670
the strong dollar puppets and it was
very sad

46
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,760
but the was kinda like a tabloid press
their

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,440
exactly they are they made it they said
the you know they

48
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,130
listed all these devices there allegedly
their virtually they said that they were

49
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,660
looking for c4 explosives inside

50
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,040
all the things did not happen or one
there

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,400
and everybody was exonerated was
arrested

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,950
eventually to this example love them

53
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,140
the police est up to red bus those
Carrie animals

54
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,710
from a tip from the secret service on
this is Camille look for a low-tech

55
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,080
biological warfare

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,130
we're gonna release all these thousands
of animals inside

57
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,430
delegate hotels are up

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,190
it turns out that these guys surprise
were delivering

59
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,220
these animals his different pet stores

60
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,370
so

61
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,720
its another strikeout for the secret
service there

62
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,250
on Sun move into some

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,700
police training manuals materials they
collected won the first one is protester

64
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,060
tactics I what they

65
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,800
with the you know I think summer some
much ruined summer

66
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,500
pretty good idea samesies myself and
some of them are untrue in

67
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,280
pretty bad ideas arm there

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,380
very well organized and coordinated
that's a that's a good point

69
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:17,629
by the technology this the as protester
tactics at the top there was

70
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:21,359
the organized crime unit was the one who
were once in the philadelphia police are

71
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,460
investigating us

72
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,669
on sadly the topic that got cut off and
had the phone number of itself

73
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,639
to sure the Contact Me Later I'll I'll
give you that

74
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,770
number if you want him a call

75
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,159
they see we've analysed businesses
vehicle city property sometimes this

76
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,810
happens

77
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,789
wanna the actually won the guys who
wrote the wind he was caught on

78
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:43,870
videotape

79
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,289
vandalizing a Philadelphia police
cruiser

80
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,188
mom its round hotels and the RNC and in
these are staying

81
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:55,300
or treated to meet them from attending
meetings well

82
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,479
we wanted to disrupt the RNC and that's
probably a good idea

83
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,599
so week I need to confer the word at
this time that we can get this

84
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:06,900
beforehand we do not that I've never
heard in the Seattle facial

85
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,300
aunt been used by anyone I don't know
anybody who's willing to

86
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,360
hasn't of the last in ordered the Droid
at anybody

87
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,520
so on the homie pepper spray

88
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,159
is in reference to

89
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:24,180
and actually was cayenne pepper in a
kitchen

90
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,289
and DC and DC protest that their

91
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:34,289
talking about their are your question

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,330
you

93
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,330
yeah

94
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,520
thank you

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,820
and you as a reference to something like
that thanks for defining met

96
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,690
this is the Rev you know that kinda
media hype that surrounds the time

97
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,060
types of things and it works into their
intelligence and sometimes you know

98
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,410
it's kinda with likely spur down the
aisle whisper down the lane

99
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,550
Tom you know protesters do

100
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,030
I don't know why you know they put gas
methanol top cocktails in the same item

101
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,420
it seem like you separate things to me I
don't know how they go together

102
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,470
are arm it is true that sometimes people
need to use Nextel

103
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,070
thought so telephones and two-way radios
to communicate

104
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,280
and sometimes you do monitor the

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,890
the police communications and I'll get
more information on how to do that later

106
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,180
see crazy going lots at hotels

107
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,030
I'm sure you just don't get caught

108
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,690
find a minor did get caught in

109
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,430
wasn't a pretty sight arm alright

110
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,670
the stopping traffic the end
Philadelphia

111
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,160
that's always a good idea volunteering
for the RNC are more on that later

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,050
that's yeah ahead pet that's simply a
good idea

113
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,640
I sabotage police to create equipments

114
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,560
I don't know I get to talking about
slashing tires that happened to some

115
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,440
extent

116
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,640
I think that the sometimes when you say
troopers contributed to that

117
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,010
warning please communication
capabilities this was

118
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,659
I'm guessing that they took this from
email that some people were suggesting

119
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,160
analysis on my discovery from a trial
saying that people should

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,370
jam police radio communications this is
a bad idea

121
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,160
on the banjo for about five years from
this is is it on the end

122
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,140
besides why would you wanna jam that
when you wanna figure out what they're

123
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,620
doing

124
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,070
on these are devices used by protesters

125
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,349
arm I don't know how these constitute
devices they seem more like objects to

126
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,710
me

127
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:49,770
rocks bottles trash cans high-tech
equipment that these protesters are

128
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,530
using here

129
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,620
signs banners and t-shirts

130
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,640
help rates

131
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,560
clotheslines those and I guess we can't
have them being clean

132
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,170
it's not with its record saying bye to
money

133
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:17,170
are on page used John Doe and Jane Doe
actually in philadelphia you use Mary

134
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,270
cheesecake

135
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,740
to be exact ice

136
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,210
I'd don't know many indications that
people using

137
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,010
different identification I don't think
he's rather than our own they usually

138
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,289
just don't carry any at all

139
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,940
arm it is a good idea to have the legal
counsel number

140
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,370
there's usually a legal are working
group in muster these demos it is a good

141
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,390
idea to have that

142
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,850
number and some time to raid on their
arms and wrists personally a

143
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,690
I would just memorize it home anarchists

144
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,440
this is the last thing in protesters in
tactics and they say were violent in

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,890
evil

146
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,569
and that there's more the troublemakers
actually

147
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,090
most love and protesters are anarchist
and

148
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,570
it does you don't have to be wearing mas
to be called

149
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,670
or b1 nights on

150
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,719
is moving more into the police tactics
this is kinda

151
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,270
overview what they do with the at the

152
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,280
the second half a bit the spin
plainclothes intelligence an arrest

153
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:18,910
teams

154
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,719
so look for people committing new crimes
and Eliza

155
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,910
else neck people of crowds the also will

156
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,260
target leaders the use mobile field
forces a bike simple

157
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,200
instead of having the ninja turtles in
the ride right squad

158
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,810
arm day a they had using bikes is right
chilton instead

159
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,080
are also you know mobile field force
basically the

160
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,890
months you know want them to be mobile
so they can move around for the

161
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,640
protesters are at an arrest them

162
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,280
and the bombing mission the see that
they weren't sure the rights of all

163
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,939
citizens in philadelphia

164
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,850
including law banning demonstrators I
don't think that happened very much the

165
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,280
later there you go okay

166
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:13,280
that's my daughter Zoe down an issue
keeping

167
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,319
she sat in her comments

168
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,550
she knows a lot about list alright

169
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,140
so this is how the ideal with how they
deal with

170
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,590
Tom civil disobedience or you know a
march in the 10

171
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,480
do a mass arrest on they clear of the
area

172
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,980
fame wanna make sure they have enough
people officers to arrest the man people

173
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,150
than 12 usually sometimes it's around
three times as many

174
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,819
and demonstration in DC you know some
people who were

175
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,310
they decided to use barricade over
chicken wire fence

176
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,610
I don't know why they're using check my
intimate sturdy never going to march

177
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,620
into this line riot cops

178
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,060
alright cuts are getting all ready to
arrest him and they didn't arrest them

179
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,900
because her that the service police
scanner was because

180
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,810
the so many locks the rest the police
right equipment inside the van the

181
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,560
confined ago

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,180
keys her so

183
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,720
and that occasion that people didn't get
arrested in the peacekeepers there and

184
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,420
they're running around like crazy trying
to figure out

185
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,209
who where the guy with the Q keys was
evidently you want to go find some extra

186
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,640
batteries for his radio

187
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,020
%uh so they can arrest people on the
commissure que me any immediate speaks

188
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,170
on the dance and

189
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,800
he said all right we'll keep you guys
back up a little bit wall back up ten

190
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,760
you know kinda took the credit for
defusing the situation and all the

191
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,939
cameras there any

192
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,010
made himself look good

193
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,000
also they one have their the
transportation pretty close by

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,190
I can kinda tell when they're going in
Penn people and instill

195
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,760
kinda the staging area you know maybe a
block over so

196
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,500
and will have will have the barricades
ready and then I'll start moving people

197
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,170
and they liked her

198
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,680
close people into these areas so they
can you know especially

199
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,740
more like peaceful protests not

200
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,450
necessary civil disobedience where
they're just you know sitting in there

201
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,120
a pen people in for a while make them
sit there for you know an hour

202
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,750
forty-five minutes what not and then
they like to you know slowly that people

203
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,930
going on in closing back and so

204
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,150
kinda diffuses the situation as far as
they're concerned

205
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,410
people are less likely they just want to
get out there that point

206
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,230
you know don't continue the protests
it's a good way for them to stop

207
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,900
protests

208
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,670
after there even happening

209
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,400
this is how the author writes on this is
more the C atom

210
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,640
model instance interesting lot of people
there yet which is kinda shoot tear gas

211
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,120
at them

212
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,300
march down the street try to get them
all the protesters to move away

213
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,410
didn't really work that well in Seattle
I don't know

214
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,890
personally I wasn't there but from 18
heard that a

215
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:57,140
you know people in just go away on

216
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,460
and when they do arrest people usually
they'll have officers behind them

217
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,590
also in and Philadelphia the

218
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,330
but I noticed and pass progresses the
know-how

219
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,610
line for right cops like this you know
it all have their arrest I guys behind

220
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,650
that door open up

221
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,949
you know the barricades and much people
and the rest some people enclose a

222
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,210
backup

223
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,440
rather than a demonstration I would not
want to get pending when I see the signs

224
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
of you know them

225
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,380
forming a messing up I would I would
like to get outta there

226
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,430
so tearing up the scanners always get
that

227
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,950
how disperse a mob scan itself evidence
that

228
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,090
you know they

229
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:46,350
or discontinue minus can is opened
commuters

230
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,470
targeting leaders happened to be

231
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,530
targeted by told releases on in the
white they mentioned sending us a key

232
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,520
figure

233
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,600
they didn't elaborate that at all and
over here

234
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,499
you can see my boot

235
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:08,139
a the best counter God is around there's
around the police officers tackling me

236
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,220
the purpose of these snatch teams as I
like to call them

237
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,230
is that they are target leader
specifically on sometimes undercover

238
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,899
cops all

239
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:20,480
pick out people in the crowd arm people
they identify on the spot as leaders

240
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,199
the also and some occasions the drive
around in

241
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:29,069
unmarked vans 90 undercover agents
incident happened

242
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:33,550
the FTA protests in Quebec somebody was
actually

243
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,639
you know they the brain now this friend
this man the

244
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,819
grab this guy chasing actually and

245
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:44,679
is just using ballpoint and these were
some people who are

246
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:48,189
you know how dare they through easy
catapult the three stuffed animals at

247
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:48,920
the police

248
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,350
a and i think is held without they offer
a while for that one

249
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,389
so are these arrest teams the usually
the

250
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:00,829
they'll use announces the scanner still
track people down first and then the

251
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:01,429
move in

252
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:04,429
on you some other you serve this

253
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:07,610
be seen the shoved against the newspaper
box

254
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,240
like to like the free take one right now
to meet my head

255
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,679
this this guy right here's the Deputy
Police Commissioner

256
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,119
actually testified against him there's
mass corns in philadelphia and

257
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:24,529
US you know right across the table from
me and he's

258
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,350
justifying why they could arrest people
for the mask ordinance which they didn't

259
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,790
charge a single person with

260
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,089
on so usually lost like that they
usually

261
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,649
use that as a as more about press tour
when actually actually use it they liked

262
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,899
it you know charge people with
conspiracy

263
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,549
to obstruct justice or possession and
some have crime

264
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,579

270
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,040

271
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,360
was my I volunteered for the on-scene

275
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,910
this guy right here who knows what he's
thinkin

276
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,759
I don't know it's a pretty funny faces
got on I

277
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:28,709
is a lieutenant by the way Int'l Raceway
shirt

278
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:34,370
sana the positions are crime intention
before this is the

279
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,649
inspiration for this 2600 cover magazine

280
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,860
that was when the cell phone those
arrested with and

281
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,519
and no I do not have a vote on a dirt at
you

282
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,209
me her I do not know about that until
afterwards

283
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,870
and since you know he lost

284
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,509
you know or loss to me yet that you
that's why don't have anymore me again

285
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:58,350
removed

286
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,939
Salam barest some experts from the RNC
command post log

287
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:09,168
on for conventioneers have their jackets
in contingents on

288
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:13,980
from Woody's bar a a number you know who
would ease it is but a

289
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,189
I

290
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,869
I anyways ever been inside

291
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:25,868
woody's by you would not leave your
jacket lying around that place

292
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:29,439
and the secret service was notified

293
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,929
and may be able to some party conspiracy
but a

294
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:37,299
I don't know I always find its kinda
ironic that there's the republicans in

295
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:37,899
the world

296
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:41,619
the owner would ease is also a gay
republican

297
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,840
like having Republican to be exact com

298
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,859
this is a the next one is a a example

299
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,199
racism in the federal government two
black men in National Guard t-shirt

300
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,289
surrounding structures abroad in spring
garden

301
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,179
on they actually were National Guard
people unloading structures abroad in

302
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,090
Spain partnership

303
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,980
this bondsmen going happens to be the C
building and

304
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,720
and other document the next one after
this there was so

305
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,749
you can there it was listed as one of
the sites where they had FEMA

306
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:17,129
people at arm and as here's another fun
tidbit

307
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,600
the FBI this is from the FBI the speaker
the house his wife had our tires every

308
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,789
SUV slashed on Walnut Street

309
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,049
I

310
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:30,249
arm there's other things such as

318
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,100
at the RNC it's a special national

353
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:21,940
redundant but terminal

354
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,489

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,658
convention center

368
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:20,429
kids it was pretty isolated and removed
from everything else in the city

369
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:25,279
and we a generous general feeling was
that people wants close to it

370
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,019
you know there'll be no chance that
actually affecting arm

371
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:32,450
in New York on however messin Square
Gardens

372
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,289
across the street arm is in the center
the city

373
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:40,879
there's many many different avenues to
effect

374
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:43,899
to prevent delegates from getting to
their hotels

375
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:49,499
this is a some some brief overview of
the security plans

376
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:54,989
you know this can be security permanent
set up around madison square garden

377
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:59,889
dole allow some pedestrians and vehicles

378
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:03,419
and new york also has forty thousand

379
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:08,029
police officers 10,000 which will be in
on a detail

380
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:12,139
and patrol the a heard somewhere that

381
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:15,239
York has the six largest standing army
in the world

382
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:18,820
so

383
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,989
and told of you know the in and believe
in Boston area having to recruit from

384
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:23,359
other

385
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,379
police agencies but I DM NYPD with their

386
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:30,429
they're standing army has already got
that covered Penn Station

387
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:34,119
now for 10 read so far is it is going to
be open but

388
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:40,409
I've heard a bunch Exeter going to be
closed so this is also

389
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:44,809
has with potential to

390
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:47,859
and some other opportunities to get
inside

391
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,649
and as I mentioned earlier the secret
service

392
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:55,320
is in charge at all the agency's been
heard that some

393
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,450
the some the state police are predicting
the governor's won't even allow to have

394
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,460
weapons inside

395
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,999
secret service is definitely running the
show for this

396
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:09,729
com just before I get to move on into
from the police stuff and into the more

397
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:13,499
how you can participate on Anna

398
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:16,720
mister recap I think that a definitely
some

399
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,019
you know I think the New York Police
Department is ample trading group unless

400
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,820
there's a city ordinance in that case
the state police are infiltrating

401
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,149
activist groups in the city

402
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:30,269
my purpose in doing this demonstration
is colonel

403
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,649
but all my ideas out in the open
sincerity been there's

404
00:24:33,649 --> 00:24:37,720
through this and since they have no
actual

405
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,070
involvement in the planning for the next
time see

406
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,109
so here's I hope their they're paying
attention earth

407
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:49,049
there's some useful information in this
on

408
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:53,259
infiltration the best way to get inside
is to volunteer

409
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:56,519
I volunteered myself for the ancien

410
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,610

I was arrested

411

412
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,460

00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,450
volunteer positions alright

466
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,680
you can the airport welcome this that
seems pretty boring to me

467
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,160
a transportation I want my friend said
philadelphia is also arrested

468
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,950
in his RNC sure its own mine you know

469
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,570
defunct my theory that you're less
likely to get arrested although he was

470
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,899
targeted specifically

471
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,110
by your driving around Republicans are

472
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,060
being a guide you can drop them off in
the wrong place you can drive around for

473
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,770
hours

474
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,600
I you can drop them off in the Bronx he
can take him to another state

475
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,080
help

476
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,730
Jersey you can send them back to their
home state

477
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,420
help arm says

478
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,460
alright are you can also staff events
which

479
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,100
kinda gets you inside closer I'll have
some different ideas for pranks you can

480
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,800
play once you already inside

481
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,130
on they'll give you some opportunities
to get close to these people

482
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,860
on visitor information again kinda
boring but I'm sure you know you could

483
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,730
poll you could ask yourself what would
Tyler Durden do and you coulda

484
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,360
you can you can insert your own a

485
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,000
and not saying you should flow out you
know the buildings or what not

486
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,970
I was referencing the you know the airs
airline seen whether adding their own

487
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,410
information into it

488
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,430
I like to propagate propaganda for this

489
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,970
conference maybe some ready dot gov
pamphlets

490
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:11,050
since they've been there for office
support I don't know I think some

491
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,510
hackers might be interested in getting
inside their office

492
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:19,480
cell think we can do inside their office
there

493
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,430
arm this is mine security kit

494
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,110
thank you the for participating in the
RNC

495

arrested com

497
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,700
so if you volunteer for the RNC you'll
get

498
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,710
a souvenir just like this I'll

499
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,680
I forgot to mention that a also joining
on see the last one they don't have this

500
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,500
position available for this time

501
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,830
is security checkpoints they had

502
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,649
volunteers checking security at the last
RNC and a

503
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,570
1e one volunteer

504
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,899
I snuck people from this cool the
americas watch inside the convention

505
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,470
they did a banner drop

506
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,800
from inside the RNC didn't get that
Mayor very much press but they did get

507
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,480
inside

508
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,520
needless to say the position is not
available sadly for the sign sees

509
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,910
side on the security people for this
conference to you

510
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,190
one have another chance next month arm

511
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:28,370
hair salons this idea came up

512
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:34,540
this is the wall the four-story a right
here this tactic CIMA

513
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,409
Kim to us during the world economic
forum when a friend of ours

514
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,130
you man you're in the car and a friend a
fee call the scenes like

515
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,540
holy shit I just got inside the World
Economic Forum

516
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,530
were like how the hell did you do that
adjustment appointment at the hair salon

517
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,500
to get my eyebrows waxed

518
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,780
up

519
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,730
you know you got past all the security
so need a manual

520
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,080
we get a hotel room that's inside the
security perimeter which is helpful

521
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,560
because there's usually the city pick-up
starting at Premier

522
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,240
now so we had a hotel room the Marriott
don't like giving the Marriott

523
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,350
money because it involved the prison
industrial complex but

524
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,830
did get as close to the World Economic
Forum home

525
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,760
so how we got inside as we know we call
up we need an appointment under your

526
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,310
core

527
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:26,580
on we gots the secret service there are
like

528
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,710
what you want to get inside who are you
and we're like lower on the list at the

529
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,350
hair salon so the secret service

530
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,440
Road guy tribes of you know goes to the
hotel

531
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,510
and meanwhile these think they're
community relations police officers

532
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,020
got the blue best know this must be
helpful to people

533
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,879
on people right direction especially not
protesters

534
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,170
and their the notice my hands

535
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,510
seems that had I got arrested with unca
got it back just in time

536
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,680
world where's the World Economic Forum

537
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,350
notice the red and black star on now my
hat there like

538
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:08,050
isn't that some plaque flagstar is not
like an anarchist symbol or something

539
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,780
and I was a call

540
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,760
no I don't know what you're talking
about it's just a star like okay

541
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,379
so then the secret service agent calms
trudging back in the psych

542
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,380
to Eric early otherwise known as many
local see

543
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,580
or you're on the list but you're not
putting to me him were like well

544
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,470
we have the name underneath reservation
for two people need one name

545
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:34,670
and years ago this is so disappointed 13
cover this plot to get inside

546
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,260
arm so then we actually got inside the
World Economic Forum

547
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,830
I got my eyebrows waxed from although I
hope highly recommended

548
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,860
her Shia she had this great quote

549
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,320
shoes this a quote from she's talk email
to

550
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,899
you know these billionaire she's like is
billionaires not like them they're so

551
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,150
obnoxious

552
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:59,870
so you have and have a kid inside the
role

553
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,930
the wall up a story there highly
recommended

554
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,780
sadly that that is now on the places
that the ninety is going to stay

555
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,120
so after we got inside after got our
eyebrows waxed he wandered around for

556
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,560
about five minutes took some pictures
inside

557
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,889
then out know where the secret service
finally noticed that we were going any

558
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,699
credentials

559
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,250
like excuse me can I help you they're
very quiet about it

560
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,290
so my

561
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,230
jester this was they didn't wanna draw
attention back to me got inside he

562
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,520
wasn't supposed to you

563
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,790
on a quiet the escort in a Cell before
manual took a picture

564
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,379
is a go can I take a picture that it was
a banner saying World Economic Forum in

565
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:38,960
that

566
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,360
and took the picture and somebody from
the conference came up and yelled at the

567
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,640
secret service agent for allowing him to
take a picture

568
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,020
they were escorted outside and but a

569
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,530
I think this tactic has great potential
for the RNC

570
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:57,640
as many different hotels and many them
health care salons inside them

571
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:04,640
so you should call around make a few
appointments and get your eyebrows waxed

572
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,580
how to dress arm I polo shirt and khakis

573
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,120
walk through several the day of the
actual protest the RNC a walk there

574
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,630
several police barricades

575
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,180
just based on the way I was dressed as a
good 20 excuse me you know I got stuck

576
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,700
behind years in any way out

577
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,830
they would park the way for me and let
me through on

578
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:28,259
you can also buy in an official line see
polo shirt they're very

579
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,130
much like the aren't see volunteer
shirts

580
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,290
on you can act like you businessperson
student I

581
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:39,310
sometimes you know you could draw no

582
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,400
you know a windbreaker you know act like
a very important honey try to act like

583
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,290
you know you really know I did all these
protesters during your city

584
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:51,450
your way just trying to get out get
through sunglasses help if you're

585
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,569
nervous

586
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,450
you can try to help avoid having on
packed I contact with people

587
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,750
props liked or snaps

588
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,260
and whatnot another movie disruption

589
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,560
pranks and sabotage on

590
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,960
at hotels and other housing the feeding
grounds at the RNC this is

591
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,600

592
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,440
such as that breakfast at tiffany's

or bars like what he's and lose their
jackets

618
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,440
they're trying to make being gay a non
issue in the Republican Party

619
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,450
I could look to them didn't see it
happening anytime soon but

620
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,840
you know that may be an opportunity help
now

621
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,950
some republicans the bank america is
also sponsoring another event

622
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,960
Tavern on the Green and also another
target for pranks in there

623
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,440
a scavenger hunt later see

624
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,070
Central Park boathouse these are all
pretty nice places

625
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,070
usually Midtown Lotte Marines

626
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:32,700
really close to fifth avenue so

627
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,060
a lot lot built these places also have
phone numbers I'll

628
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,000
you social engineers out there in a call
these places

629
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,190
make a few different reservations
different republicans needs change them

630
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,780
around call the health department

631
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,050
what not .eu transportation

632
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,240
there's several different ways to

633
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,510
gum up the works in the transportation
charter buses

634
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:02,770
subways and motorcades charter buses the
struggle bus is the shuttle around

635
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,950
conventioneers

636
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:08,540
at the I in seamlessly cut the can't be
trusted to use public a sip

637
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,490
public transportation by themselves me
they're afraid they're going to get lost

638
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:17,620
and me they don't want to be separated
as many gonna build aces presents

639
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,220
buses can get stuck in traffic the easy
to distinguish

640
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,270
usually they have a banner saying what
hotels the pickup at

641
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,730
so that way you know if you get a texan
and I'm home

642
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,860
an easily blocked and

643
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:35,270
most importantly all charter buses are
easily dis-

644
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:40,100
able on everybody pay attention to this
one in the back

645
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,930
a ball charter buses by the engine
there's a kill switch in an online panel

646
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:48,169
this is in case have any you know
emergency accident

647
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,480
you know you need controls close to the
engine to be able to shut it off

648
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,740
on several on C protesters

649
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,910
at in philadelphia word able to
dismantle

650
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,100
on not dismantle disable

651
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:06,660
several buses in this method now on this
also has a safety issue too because

652
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,799
sometimes you know if you're blocking
plus

653
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,990
you know any don't want a bus to get
real road rage so you can go around back

654
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,500
turn it off in that way

655
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,610
everybody by Keane is safe alright so

656
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,450
this is to you notice that this is
seventh Avenue here in this

657
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:28,960
shoes concentration hotels here and it's
up now and heading towards missing

658
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,440
Square Gardens which is around here arm
this is probably when the

659
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,000
bus routes for the shuttle's cell get
out your pen and paper and make new to

660
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,540
this

661
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,480
seventh Avenue is about two mile stretch
that can hit all these buses

662
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,750
subways minus

663
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,170
the quick access they're also going to

664
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:53,050
be giving out free subway passes the
republicans boo

665
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:58,020
they should pay for it on the pluses
that isolates republicans

666
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,810
and there's usually signs posted to help
them find their way more on this later

667
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:06,759
him motorcades

668
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,339
