44
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,400
and how it's gonna bring it back to the
people slowly over time

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,420
for taking baby steps now our progress
from here

46
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,689
hi am much

47
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:45,560
my name is Matt Stoller ants I am

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,540
I was working any in a software company
sport

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,970
start locking in the political space

50
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,510
I did 2000 at

51
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,690
political on I got very heavily
politicized

52
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,440
as political scene that crazier and
crazier and to start working as a

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,769
volunteer for John Kerry

54
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:13,879
and then I I went to the draft card min
which was an online movement

55
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:17,230
using blocks various types

56
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,650
tools to organize people to support West
Park

57
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,859
after that I produced a public radio
show

58
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,010
and block of black president which was
perhaps a bit too hopeful

59
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,798
for what what has happened subsequently
arm and now I am

60
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,290
like Brad volunteering at the convention
to help them

61
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,560
with their partner strategy nothing that
I say represents

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,579
anything that the mention democrats

63
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:45,980
actually have to say it's it's all

64
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,389
these are my opinions private citizen on
and so you should believe me either

65
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,370
but you can be sure that if we were
representing the Democratic Party would

66
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,349
be wearing ties

67
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,389
in

68
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:02,200
hi I'm way meet Andy when a couple web
sites

69
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,489
one is complacent or which they're out
about five years is kinda perhaps not

70
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,150
quite a blog

71
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,190
regularly update with culture Jim Stynes
video

72
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,349
parties on the political sphere for a
long time

73
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,650
but this summer really focused on camera
convention or

74
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,630
which you guys might have heard the
republicans are coming to New York City

75
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,829
and a couple months

76
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,050
and I'm where organizing a pretty large
response to them

77
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,470
posters have anybody want some

78
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,430
right now once we leave Heather

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,639
having its coming and sitting in the
same jersey and right now so it's an

80
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,229
exciting moment for Nick city and

81
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,700
my main interest from blogging and this
whole like by the spheres

82
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,310
just that democratization news on the
controller media and really getting icon

83
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,889
waz up there because the mainstream
media scholar where

84
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,240
interest in their own hands and not so
much are so

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,690
that's kinda army focus right so I just
wanna start

86
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,060
little briefly with Air Canada the
backgrounder the

87
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,979
world that's gotten us to this point and
we're just gonna talk a little bit about

88
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,219
the issues in an open

89
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:09,570
for up to questions and

90
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,320
probably extend a commentary from you so

91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,520
the history the conventions and they're
kinda the two-party system

92
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,440
I mean the first democratic convention
now it's going to give the

93
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,580
is for the democratic convention but
example one because thats

94
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,960
largely what I'll be talking about at
this our first

95
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,039
is that the first democratic national
convention was held in 1832

96
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,610
in Baltimore in there for several ones
were held actually in Baltimore first

97
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,210
mention

98
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,159
Andrew Jackson Martin Van Buren were the
ticket and

99
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,860
back van the size the delegations were
actually dependent on

100
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,469
the distance the states were from
baltimore sows

101
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:51,000
you know if you're closer you could
bring more people I guess so they don't

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,500
have to pay that much for their
transportation or something

103
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,099
and 1840 the they introduce a platform
for the first time

104
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,150
in the convention 1844 was the first
time that

105
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,520
the it took multiple ballots to

106
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,810
elect the candidate an hour's
essentially it was the first time there

107
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,280
was a real

108
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,680
by over who was going to be the
democratic candidate

109
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,969
arm 1848 the Democratic National
Committee

110
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:20,669
came into existence our as the
organization that handle the party's

111
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,260
affairs in between the conventions

112
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,849
and then you had the Civil War where
people just a

113
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:29,060
like basically southern democrats

114
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,240
split often kinda you know were will pit
stop at the northern democrats that

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,110
slavery was bad

116
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,389
hi and then can if

117
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,690
things kinda settle down the democrats
kept on nominating

118
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,190
people walking away and then roosevelt
came along and then

119
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,580
the the highway that you know he lost
was dying

120
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,010
so then we get up to 1968 which is kinda
real

121
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,200
crazy crazy convention

122
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,810
where you had me television introducing
political campaigns and Mike 1952 was

123
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,719
the first one where had

124
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:07,649
any effect I was a personal time that
they were essentially TV political spots

125
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:12,380
the 1968 was probably the either the
higher than eight years how you look at

126
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,630
it

127
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,740
as the effective television on
conventions where you had

128
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,250
a four fight going on inside the
convention when two people battling over

129
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,959
who's going to become the nominee

130
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,990
then outside you had little riots I you
dad

131
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,640
talk about 12,000 Chicago we spout 15

132
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,849
a hundred people from the Army National
Guard

133
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:39,200
quest thousand secret service agents
mixing up with the hippies and

134
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,870
just every single possible protest group

135
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,149
in you know even like patrick buchanan
was down there the

136
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,940
day Democratic National Convention at
Time use wanna see you

137
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,490
and now me it was a it was a crazy crazy
time animated democrats look extremely

138
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,289
bad and

139
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,630
the the Republican National Convention
the same time is pretty crazy in print

140
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,370
after that was really the point at which
the

141
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,560
on the powers that be realized that

142
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,500
convention you if you wanted to your
convention

143
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,690
had better be totally pre-planned pre
scripted

144
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:17,159
and preordained so at because the whole
thing is is that while

145
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,019
II a complete Aydin unscripted
convention makes good TV from the

146
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:25,339
perspective the press it makes terrible
TV from their perspective

147
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:30,519
a political candidate or party and tax
credit poured us to today

148
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,890
where the conventions in are

149
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,189
at least from the perspective you know
the general public and the media and

150
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,260
even the people inside the party

151
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,529
%ah that its primarily I

152
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,810
essentially coronation ceremony no kind
of a media event

153
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,950
where your its in the pain like

154
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,170
Oscars the Emmys or something and

155
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,079
that races this whole question while Why
should there be

156
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,339
15,000 members at the at the the media

157
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,750
covering this event not something we're
going to talk about

158
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,779
now at the same time in starting

159
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,279
obviously much more re well-known really
starting the same time you have common

160
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:12,529
sense with the history this let us up to
this kinda world

161
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:15,529
blog so what if you want call them were
I mean the

162
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:19,470
the roots especially when you talk about
the world of political

163
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,500
you know this kinda open political press
it starts around the revolutionary

164
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,750
before the Revolutionary War with that
pamper tearing

165
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,089
that went on there where people would
just put out incendiary track said

166
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:35,089
just you know trashed near opponents

167
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,870
and at the same time talked about like
major huge political ideas they used

168
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,260
Sudan's a night published I mean
honestly the

169
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,600
the traded columns in all these
different papers that were published all

170
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,470
over the place

171
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,170
and and then gotta recognizes that you
have this

172
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,279
very open and free dialogue existing
within the world

173
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,769
I love essentially there you know your
upper middle class white man

174
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:04,130
which you know and so that's but at the
same time

175
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,779
within that world it was astoundingly
free and

176
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,320
pretty on unfettered and

177
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,529
the kneecap Morlock and we get the

178
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:19,700
coming up you know late seventies the
introduction in the first PBS's

179
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,600
you know BBS /a and Chicago by were
Christians and then

180
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,170
you have Fido neck can appoint all the
PBS's together

181
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,060
in the early eighties are cunts witching
over to the west

182
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,410
you know in all the BBS systems pretty
much die with the introduction

183
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,170
the web in mosaic and then netscape in
95 96

184
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,719
and Slashdot shows up around that time

185
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,750
night your said like chasen's links from
the underground was kinda like the first

186
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,450
site where somebody's I'm just gonna put
my entire personal life on the web

187
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,310
and them with the introduction

188
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,470
gonna blogging software around 2,000

189
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,120
get this huge explosion and also as more
and more

190
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,040
kinda normal people joined the weapon
discovered in

191
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,149
are you have a whole generation of
people who I'm

192
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,510
you know I'm this crazy generation it
didn't grow up with

193
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,750
a low counts and so now you have what

194
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,149
hundreds of thousands people on
livejournal using blood

195
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,810
common minutes probably millions to the
sites now

196
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,610
and every summer them our political one

197
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,319
number of them have real have had a real
impact in covering things like that

198
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:34,790
the 2000 recount and just you know in

199
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,569
all this stuff that's going on today in
the campaigns and then you also have the

200
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:39,569
introduction

201
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:42,899
with the Howard in campaign basically a
a

202
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,910
a campaign that do web

203
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:50,180
and its weblog are inextricably linked
with

204
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,329
its the campaign success and perhaps its
downfall

205
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:58,120
and back I brings this up to today real
briefly

206
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,899
in terms of now we have to now basically
any if you're owed

207
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,259
candidate special your democratic and
you're running for office somewhere

208
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,449
your website probably has a weblog while
you know you

209
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:12,620
definite website probably have a weblog
some sort

210
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,310
you know the Democratic National
Convention is credentialing

211
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,399
like something about about 30 bloggers
which is

212
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,779
you to think about it in which funny is
that it's actually this big deal

213
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,560
there's always posts and news stories
about it but the funny thing is

214
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,939
there are 15,000 members the media

215
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:33,339
coming to the convention and notes and
we're talking about a few

216
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:38,160
handful few dozen these these people
that

217
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,139
you know in in that's kinda in some
sense me maybe from my perspective it's

218
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,589
the only story body

219
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:47,089
its it's seen as this great shining hope

220
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:50,459
some kind of new thing and it said it's
a really interesting

221
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,990
question it makes him kinda wonder what
the whole point

222
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,870
the institution is and both the kind of
the

223
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,870
the sadness and hopeful but thats

224
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,600
all I'm gonna say really because I don't
really have any

225
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,579
real I'm not actually really done
anything useful like any these people

226
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,199
here so I'm gonna let them start talking
about things

227
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,680
and I just like I out into can talk a
little more about

228
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,519
how he sees the role blogging in the
kinda the 2004 campaign

229
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,029
both from his personal experience with
Howard Dean

230
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:26,059
democrat meet up into you by the
convention

231
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:29,370
and than their Republican convention and
just

232
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,850
start talking about things

233
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,160
yet when when I started running i join
the campaign around

234
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,499
June full-time and you know that the
blog became this huge thing

235
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,120
I C 2004 I 2003

236
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,110
June I I join campaign and you know we
just are getting a block in the blog was

237
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,800
difference then any other campaign ever
done before because people were allowed

238
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,370
to use their own voice

239
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,300
and they were able to use their opinions
were as you know every other campaign if

240
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,769
you wanna

241
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:02,720
say something you have to make sure it's
on message you have to make sure that

242
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,930
everybody agrees with it now proves that
about 30 different ways before something

243
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,019
happens

244
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,410
are managing campaign people were
allowed to say what they wanted

245
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,689
about their opinions about what they
wanted to say and it

246
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:16,719
it made a huge difference all the sudden
we had this community on the blog of you

247
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,490
know thousands of commenters who were

248
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,930
sitting there everyday participating
taking part interactively with the

249
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,040
campaign

250
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,509
arm you know we'd raise you know that

251
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:29,600
the the the politicians they never
really

252
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,519
understood blogging or anything like it
and tell money got involved when they

253
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,870
realize that they could

254
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,209
you know get a obscene amounts of money
from this all the sudden they woke up to

255
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:39,970
it and saw

256
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,209
what we're doing on you know we'd we
post something early in the day our

257
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:45,360
first big

258
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,779
thing was I don't know I mean people
familiar with the but we put a bad up on

259
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,069
when data is an idea given to us by
commenter who said

260
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:55,920
you know we should put up a something to
compare to

261
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,680
that dick cheney was gonna have a
250,000 our fundraising lunch

262
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,230
with two thousand dollars a plate so we
put up a bat

263
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,879
as cover thermometer and we said okay
we're gonna see how if we can match

264
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,449
dick cheney by Monday when he has his
lunch

265
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,199
and will stars on Friday and by Saturday

266
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,079
we had matched him for tonight fifty
thousand dollars and by Monday

267
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,189
we had made over five hundred thousand
dollars all from donations under a

268
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,959
hundred dollars

269
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,160
often people who were just sick and
tired of the same old rhetoric the same

270
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,800
old routine

271
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,579
were ready to hear something different
arm

272
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:35,670
the blocks sense then obviously you know
our campaign has sensed

273
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,079
died but win the carey campaign put up a
blog

274
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,470
you know to match ours I they are doing
it the same way

275
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,610
way they're doing it is the mostly just
press releases

276
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,269
arm you know but people aren't allowed
to still give their own opinion because

277
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:52,809
it in the campaign environment it's too
dangerous

278
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:56,160
for the mainstream candidates and to say
anything you know if anything's of

279
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,829
message

280
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,819
the republicans will take it and twisted
internet make him something dangerous

281
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,100
you know like its it just becomes a free

282
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,290
crazy think so on you know but

283
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,170
blogging is is slowly making its way in
the world and we're starting to get

284
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,670
attention to the right things

285
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,399
making our way people like you know
people are blocks are starting to have

286
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,490
an effect on

287
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,999
on politics for example the trent lott
affair I don't know how many people are

288
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,439
aware what happen with that

289
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,420
trent lott said that he really wish that

290
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,949
strong thurman we wish the strom thurman
at one all those years ago

291
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:30,790
because then the country would be great
and you know strike strong was running

292
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,899
on segregation party ticket

293
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:38,240
and if if it hadn't been for about fifty
different bloggers all talking at same

294
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,980
time saying

295
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,999
look this is racist this is totally
ridiculous

296
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:46,230
Eunos he still be trent lott would still
be in at six power but because the blogs

297
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,179
we were able to remove him from power
but backed down where he belongs

298
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,550
somewhat we have gotten totally out of
it yet but you know is not a position

299
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,499
power anymore so the blocks are slowly
starting to

300
00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:00,470
make a difference in campaigns

301
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:07,089
on so how many does your democrats just
curious

302
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,889
how many have you are voters in the
primaries

303
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,360
its that's a fair number I guess the
real question is how many view like

304
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,990
didn't vote you know I don't know I in
the primaries for years ago

305
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,270
or whatever mean like already is this
how many people is this the first time

306
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,760
you're actually motivated boat

307
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,120
get people back more specifically here
voted in 2000

308
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,340
okay did

309
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,399
on

310
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,179
voted for Nader voted for Nader alright
lower case affair

311
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:50,150
I'm alright where being interactive

312
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,090
I had a I had a whole nice PowerPoint
presentation that I decided

313
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,178
pictures everything I guess I will show
up really

314
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,440
like I well I know how many does think
that there's too much money in politics

315
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,890
see you think that money to do it
distorts the political scene somehow

316
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,059
i think thats it's a fairly

317
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,059
widely-helds on

318
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,178
it's a fairly widely held sentiment that
there's too much money in politics

319
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,720
storing our political system in some way
on

320
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,950
we have to ask why it is that money is
such a problem

321
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,100
was SLES bad a problem a couple years
ago

322
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,179
and the reason I think most people
understand it is

323
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,470
because money buys media time and as a
politician you need to get your message

324
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:35,750
out

325
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,760
so you need to get money in so you can
buy TV time

326
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,520
broadcast time you can then get the bus
to get elected

327
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,330
as media types become more and more
expensive money has proportionally

328
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,549
become more and more important

329
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:53,240
politics but what's happened is the
authenticity in the relationship between

330
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,280
politicians

331
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,809
and the constituents have declined in
importance

332
00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:01,200
I'm you can see this in the convention
I'm gonna

333
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,380
read you what some bloggers have said
about convention hearing

334
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:11,380
on

335
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,280
personnel what we're doing for boxers
the next picture week next

336
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,480
bench has a blog called Boston Tea Party
are

337
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,950
blogger's are actually going to be
credentialed first time either gonna

338
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,230
come into the hall and

339
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:33,820
and they're gonna talk to delegates and
treated like media happy has blocked by

340
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,100
the way

341
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,920
have you guys read political blogs at
all

342
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:45,700
yes you get here okay that's thats
nearly seven yes as

343
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,930
I you guys are smart I guess anyway

344
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,630
that were having bloggers.com first time
and

345
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,900
their public bloggers outside the
convention delegates are probably

346
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,020
will some doubts definitely antibody
there may be a lot more delegates

347
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,790
blogging and what this is going to use
its going to transform the story at the

348
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,520
convention

349
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,350
somehow because you're gonna have people
art in professional media jobs

350
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,620
that are just telling their stories and
have people platforms

351
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,720
to the world s as other army

352
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,550
and thats gets gonna present a real
challenge to traditional media

353
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,620
political narrative but nobody really
knows what's gonna happen

354
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,740
I'm kinda excited to see there is a
script

355
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,940
can't conventions because is very
dangerous

356
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,050
up 1968 was a good example but you can
find a lot of examples

357
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:39,080
92 when pat buchanan give speech that
was very

358
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,429
right-wing anti-immigrant anti-gay

359
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,750
up so many made the comment that it
sounded better in its original German

360
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,930
on and it really embarrassed

361
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,860
george bush that that one and he lost

362
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,670
and some people point to that this
problem so conventions have really

363
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,050
become

364
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,050
about aback troll there is a script this
is what some bloggers are saying about

365
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,820
it they're calling it

366
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:06,070
call it a worthless infomercial or just
entertainment for big donors

367
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:13,070
party

368
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,200
this the picture caseload you worked
hard

369
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,010
yeah and that's the block on

370
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,620
anyway cell this from a blog called

371
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,880
testing which is the smartest blog on

372
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,220
pressed dot org it's the smartest by Don
media criticism in politics that I'd

373
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,580
basically he Jay Rosen who is

374
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,970
professor at NYU journalism

375
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,510
talks about the script nature
conventions and what that means

376
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,600
on essentially nobody really understands

377
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,730
why their conventions bloggers are going
to have the opportunity

378
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,200
to rewrite the air this is

379
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,090
somebody who is comparing I conventions
to

380
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,820
reality shows and comparing them
unfavorably I'll

381
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,520
agree with that compares back its
interesting that this is

382
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,750
discourse that's what people are talking
about in the media sphere about

383
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,470
conventions

384
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,550
and so there really is an opportunity
here

385
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,700
to you to rewrite what a convention is
about

386
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,110
and because bloggers are not part the
traditional

387
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:33,820
media establishment and they're not part
traditional political asylum in a lot of

388
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,169
ways

389
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,500
I think you're gonna see some really
innovative coverage for them because

390
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,820
they're gonna tell you about like their
meeting

391
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,889
what it's like they're gonna they're
gonna

392
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,190
look behind you know that that in the
nooks and crannies

393
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,790
maybe there won't be anything
interesting there but I think there will

394
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,540
be and

395
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,840
just asserted go undetected sec here
struck the right place

396
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,870
there is a real challenge to

397
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,050
a broadcast infrastructure going on
right now as you guys know

398
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,669
most if you re political blocs you can
comment on them

399
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,010
a lot have blocks and that represents a
sea change how people can approach

400
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,080
politics and how they can people can
approach their lives

401
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,699
up what this is going to do. is its
gonna returns mentions

402
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,170
in the next 10-20 years gonna return

403
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,530
it and moved away from TV dominated
politics

404
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:24,690
and towards human stories personal
stories party connections

405
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,780
that's my kinda sent any these are two
things that are pretty

406
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,240
the second one is blocks if you wanna
get information about

407
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,550
I yet is actually get set up

408
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:43,940
its PowerPoint

409
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,890
every on Press think that are two very

410
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,960
it's affected by we talked about this
and then up that

411
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,420
benched blog is dance 2004 dot work
slash block

412
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,710
you know they can get a lot of
information there's

413
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,150
first political national image blocked
exist

414
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,240
so follow the blogs when the convention

415
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,450
you're gonna see some interesting
stories you're going to be able to

416
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,800
interact people that are there

417
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,220
and its I have to say I think it's gonna
be very interesting watching

418
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,130
I mean I think that you know it's way he
said the word innovative in their I

419
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,690
think the ironies is that

420
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,100
the coverage I love the blogs will in
some sense be

421
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,800
exactly the opposite innovative it'll
simply be a return to White

422
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,390
journalism is supposed to be which is
actually telling the stories

423
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,309
up what happens in white most people are
interested in

424
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:36,750
learning about and I think be ives
strongly expect that

425
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,120
the both the television and newspaper
and radio

426
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,809
outlets will its see this as

427
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:47,879
you know this see this as a threat not
because

428
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,240
their box there's a lot of them or you
know at the convention or because they

429
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,580
have what's my behind them

430
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,250
but just because it's gonna be so
obviously more interesting

431
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,870
and be used with so much less resources
and as we've seen

432
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,540
whether it's done in like the world
software hardware

433
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,290
or you know in in political Sears

434
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:12,860
there's going to be extremely strong
backlash from the traditional media and

435
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,030
I think will be really interesting to
see what the coverage

436
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,350
love the coverage up the blogger's is
going to be in the traditional media

437
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,870
am yeah can actually says better

438
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,070
we'll talk you can't I like the a hand
raising

439
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,370
think we see again who in this room
rates political blogs

440
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:34,840
adequate Kate who would trust those
plugs

441
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,800
over CNN the soviet particular trust
those blogs

442
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:44,380
over fuck since everyone in the room who
thinks Fox News is mostly just for the

443
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:44,850
shit

444
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,520
sales aka said pick a majority um

445
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,780
cuz I think there's a whole other beyond
just the this there's there's a whole

446
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,220
other story beyond what's going on
inside the convention hall this can't be

447
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,810
happening

448
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:02,120
on this can be a lot of kinda protests
um happening especially on the

449
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,429
republican convention this was a bust in
but I think

450
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,050
around blisters a whole sphere people
already

451
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm getting ready to raise up to get the
voice heard on that's been ignored for

452
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,890
the past four years

453
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,150
and I think that democratization in the
news

454
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,130
in that sense it's really really crucial
and we've already seen it because I'm

455
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,590
it's so easy for a protest something
there's a lot of real

456
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:28,570
issues are standing up for so easy be
put into a little box by Fox News or CNN

457
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,810
and the biggest we were going to combat
that this with their own blood

458
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,460
their own voice and um to be couple
links RNC watch .org which

459
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,590
Anna anybody seen yet that's one of the
main um

460
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,760
blocks following what's going on around
the convention Nelson County Convention

461
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,830
that Oracle word gonna be starting a
project called I am York City which is

462
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,820
gonna be telling the story

463
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,050
organizes on the ground building on

464
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,070
issues its gonna featured people with
aids homeless people

465
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,320
youth organizers old people church
people um

466
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,169
who what with voices would otherwise be
lost in the shuffle

467
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,179
because there's there's gonna live
attention with the pomp and circumstance

468
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:05,340
within the convention halls

469
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,500
but with our blogs in with this like new
medium we have

470
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,450
we can really compete with CNN directly
and tell their own stories

471
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,190
and I think this me really crucial to
tell not just the stories from within

472
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,080
the convention halls

473
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,370
but what's happening on the street which
is going to be bigger and

474
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,910
have a feeling just a bit more exciting
actually can you also just talk a little

475
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,370
bit

476
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,240
about there's the whole thing and
providing an alternative to traditional

477
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,980
media looking awesome just talk a little

478
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,230
bit about how you essentially play the
media

479
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,570
in other words like you know
organizations like the owners are

480
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,360
bushings

481
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,000
people who recognize that the way that
you get a message out

482
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,550
is by in some sense you know doing
something that they'll show

483
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,710
but that still lets you well

484
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,840
there's this sense ovum in a kind of
viral campaigning

485
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,160
and the idea love having a message that
can really be broken down by the media

486
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,350
which the difficult thing

487
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,780
on this group going as for bush right
you you hear that name any

488
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,280
kinda your diary immediately comets much
people dress up in sexy as

489
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,360
good every bush thinking like uniform or
wars and free the Forbes 400

490
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,360
an and more tax cuts for the wealthy and
that kinda stuff plays very well to the

491
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,390
media and the media just

492
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,790
to I am think they're going on across
country torn

493
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,928
again i mean the thing is is in perhaps
it the funny thing is it's

494
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:25,429
you know it's because that the media
they what they respond Tuesday respond

495
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:26,580
to you

496
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,970
essentially they respond to cynicism and
ironing because that's the way that they

497
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,080
see the political process

498
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,730
and its when the most I think

499
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,690
destructive things to him democracy when
their Press

500
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,450
said he doesn't believe in the
institution Tom

501
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,060
and actually to that like I think when
the most interesting contrasts in

502
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,139
offices

503
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,250
that if you just look at the conventions
you understand them as

504
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,620
essentially television peace and if you
look at those quotes that Jay Rosen

505
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,080
looking at its it's very clearly this is
if you look at the conventions through

506
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,689
the eyes have what you get to see

507
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,080
on that television and I won't even I'll
on the

508
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,220
attack television because in theory if
everybody on if

509
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,669
you know if television was controlling
the same way that the Internet was

510
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:11,700
controlled

511
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,080
I it's quite likely that people would
think that you know

512
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,780
television is a great and democratizing
medium

513
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,389
right exactly and you know and if public
access you know they

514
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,929
there's there's public access and if
crazy so handsome who watches public

515
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:30,220
access

516
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,820
and you know and for those four people
they probably get the same value added

517
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,490
that as

518
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,520
reading the blogs and and those things
and if

519
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,770
if ninety-six percent of us we're
raising our and right there then

520
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:46,490
I think we see television a completely
different way

521
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:52,540
by oh yeah and

522
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,629
well so he the question was what about
radio sources is npr

523
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,990
well i mean the thing is is that

524
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:02,830
these the way essentially I mean if you
just look at the way that the

525
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,678
arm the Brock West frequencies are
handed out

526
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,250
it it's essentially the same in radio
and television and the words

527
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,300
guy its control by very few institutions

528
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,250
and make whether those institutions are
explicitly

529
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,270
corporate or whether they're you know
institutions like npr the

530
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,340
them fact matter is is at their
institutions that are designed to

531
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,640
protect their

532
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,100
existence and to prevent other people
from

533
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,150
getting onto the airwaves think I

534
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,669
actually produced a show on public radio
and

535
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:40,530
the the real problem here's not liberal
thats not true

536
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:44,190
just their more responsible coverage but
they are

537
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,800
there's no parks balance on the radio
out but the the other problem

538
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,950
these media is not that they are owned
by corporations but that

539
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,600
that their protest that their inherently
disempowered because you're listening

540
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,870
and you can't talk back and they aren't
being used in a way that lets

541
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,970
talkback so one of the things that
radios like that

542
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,030
it's more conversational dust succulent
Asami

543
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,178
with a TV does buddy it still you only
have

544
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,580
you know a couple of people on on the
radio so it's disempowering medium

545
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,830
and as such it serves the politics
disempowerment cynicism a nap

546
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,080
out that the real promises the Internet
isn't is in using

547
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,370
these media to you know to have
conversations

548
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,240
television can be useful for that
television can be democratizing force

549
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,010
if it's used appropriately with other
media that can produced i lock

550
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,290
but the issue is not about who owns
these media sources although

551
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,850
that is a problem the issue is more
about how the media sources are used

552
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,240
to create a culture of consumerism and

553
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,790
in a political apathy issue given
politics is a POS

554
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,940
to the politics participatory politics

555
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,530
that's say it it said NPR's a better
source for news

556
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,770
but its its to the standard I like or
Brazil

557
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,580
just and drink responsibly I think the
issue the reason why

558
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,668
TV and radio so commercialized because
who owns it

559
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:12,380
me if we saw a few years ago that there
was om

560
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,230
desi opened up a small band radio and
thus anything close to back down very

561
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,190
quickly

562
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,120
I'm I think small band radios its kinda
interesting on parallel to

563
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,230
blogging where people suddenly connected
on voice out there

564
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,610
ans because the corporate interests
because

565
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,350
you know government control in who pays
to back I shut down very quickly

566
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,740
we can't really do that with internet
com so if I think it really is a matter

567
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,550
for loans it I think that kinda

568
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,760
defines home how it works and because
internet

569
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,169
is essentially decentralized it becomes
and essentially democratize

570
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:47,710
information source that its power

571
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,860
and is if you have more questions as
commander is a ransom

572
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:57,860
basically keep this is questions a front

573
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,870
many edges repeat the question for
because i've seen the people in the back

574
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,330
can really hear that am i right so

575
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,360
I whose is kinda talking about whether

576
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,580
we see the imports blocks being in the
fact that their

577
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,130
thousands of them many a or you know
hundreds thousands maybe millions I

578
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,560
think these days

579
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,159
and a menem the vast majority of them
very small and have very small audiences

580
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,260
or is the real

581
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,850
importance that there are om you know a
few big players

582
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:53,330
like in the trent lott thing the
newspapers

583
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,930
picked the up the story in the media
picked up the story

584
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:00,040
largely in some sense to do that or at
least you know is

585
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,200
so the theory goes uprising by the work
by I'd

586
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,420
Joshua Michael Marshall who's a reporter
who has his

587
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,620
on kinda personal weblog at

588
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,069
Talking Points Memo dot com tells
comments

589
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:17,570
um well yet the I think you know the

590
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,110
the big voices I'm we need to have the
big voices out there i mean it's

591
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,720
you know there's gonna be big ones
there's going to be small is just like

592
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,240
the media

593
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,990
you know the Internet is kind of self
its itself doing that

594
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,990
you know it based on the quality of the
content is how much traffic you get

595
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,590
on the really big blocks a trios
DailyKos

596
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,379
the you know all those guys they they
tend to get that kinda traffic because

597
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:40,069
they have

598
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,740
a lot of quality material and on a wide
variety of subjects

599
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,460
you know there's there's more
specialized blogs on that also cover you

600
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,840
only certain subjects

601
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,129
that tend to get smaller amount of
traffic by each of them you know has

602
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:53,449
their own thing that they can offer

603
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:57,799
arm all them are are slowly gaining more
important like the

604
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,890
you know the the the current thing is is
bush's draft record

605
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,440
I Kevin Drum at Washington Monthly dot
com he

606
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,260
he just kept pounding away at that thing
in studying it and starting at pushing

607
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,600
and pushing and finally

608
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,410
people like alter Mann other people
started picking it up again I

609
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,670
and then when Michael Moore went on you
know Wes clark's

610
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,090
rally and said bush's a deserter you
know it didn't really even make that

611
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,960
much of a difference but then peter
jennings got really mad that he called

612
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,730
on that and said

613
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,070
we mean the president's deserter have
dare you to keep kid with you

614
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,620
you know would you like Michael Moore
represent you like that and Clark said I

615
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,680
don't know it's his opinion

616
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,839
is the right to it and when people
started investigating it again

617
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,310
you know it still had to go through the
mainstream media to get there but I

618
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,230
think eventually

619
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,560
are these these multiple voices are out
there that will rising up

620
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,630
you know date they get they're starting
to really take no

621
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,940
in the media and he is also having all
the trouble right now because

622
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,380
you know like when the Dean campaign
happen people

623
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,470
in the D campaign work varies aus about
every newspaper article that came out in

624
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,490
anything that was in the slightest when
negative about Tina wrong or incorrect

625
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:04,720
you know people would crawl at these
reporters bytes and just pound them with

626
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,080
angry email after angry mail and blogs
which you know critique

627
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,080
every single article and it was forcing
these people to

628
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,120
think about the way they right there
reports and articles

629
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,549
and it slowly I mean granted they're
still %uh to laziness in the media right

630
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:18,850
now

631
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,930
but I think it's it slowly changing the
paradigm thanks blocks

632
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,899
I just wanna real quickly a little sign
and know if you guys are the latest on

633
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,420
the a

634
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,010
the bush army military record air

635
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,090
National Guard records is that high they
just the just discovered

636
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:39,390
that in not this is so the story goes
that in 1996 and 1997

637
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,310
his payroll records for the three months
that he

638
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,830
disappeared I'm somehow got destroyed

639
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,350
and he is curious here really angry at
the AI

640
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,380
the they only just found out that this
happened %ah

641
00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:00,380
seven years ago

642
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:13,180
well I work were I O you should live
message I talk to you I'm at in well %ah

643
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,190
after day after they talkin I wanna

644
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,820
actually meant touches something he said
which is which is me this is Craig in

645
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,030
this crazy like

646
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,940
a laxative the records were destroyed I
mean like it's not

647
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,240
its did this political environment is
just it's lunacy and

648
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,470
it's like we're living in a surreal
world but

649
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,490
to your point I mean power blocs
impacting like people like to look at

650
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:35,960
numbers

651
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,630
how many people are reading it but to
have any people here read david

652
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,970
hackworth

653
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:44,190
have heard david hackworth okay david
hackworth is

654
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,640
a military guy to the spot in like you
like lied to get the army's

655
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,080
15 his the the most decorated soldier in
the military real

656
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,029
like a soldier soldier and he runs it
it's like a block type website for

657
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,690
soldiers

658
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:02,380
I and so you can go there and you can
find out what the troops are really

659
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:02,930
thinking

660
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:06,520
because in his website they have agreed

661
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,830
put the pictures got floated on 60
minutes that

662
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,900
West virgin family that had the pictures

663
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,590
tried to go to major media outlets they
wouldn't listen and they went to david

664
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,210
hackworth

665
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,230
and he got them on 60 minutes to

666
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:25,100
and that was a really really important
thing to have happen no it's not

667
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,770
that the blocks broke that or that 60
minutes to his unimportant

668
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:33,730
what it what it really is suggesting
it's like two blocks suggestive a

669
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,350
a change power relationship when a poor
West Virginian soldier

670
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,750
dealer gym I see American occupation of
Iraq to a substantial number of people

671
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,970
just because they have a digital camera
and there are these web sites around

672
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,060
it's not a broadcast medium and it
doesn't you having big blog

673
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:54,710
not big box a small bloggers isn't
really the important kinda component its

674
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,820
this issue dialogue there's a forced
dialogue there doesn't matter how big

675
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,470
you are

676
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,830
if you aren't responsible them there is
no bigger institutions in the US

677
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,580
military

678
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,080
saying $3,400 billion dollars a year and
they are forced

679
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,350
to contend with what one West Virginia
soldier

680
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:14,130
was you know their first kid that they
were trying to dump this scandal

681
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,140
on the back cities four soldiers and
that really is because the internet

682
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,370
because out that open and free progress
structure mixer it takes on the

683
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,720
questions from the way

684
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,990
back with the woods prize purse in the
back its that's the right there

685
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:34,990
yeah

686
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,060
well

687
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,340
said the basic question is Is I mean if
I is

688
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,820
talk about it as the big logs get bigger
have larger audiences and

689
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,280
accent more more advertising aren't they
gonna

690
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,090
I mean ok I'm paraphrasing and help with
acceptable that I they basically gonna

691
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,550
turn into traditional media sources or
have the same problems being beholden to

692
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,660
their advertisers

693
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,799
that we see in the the traditional media
that

694
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,830
the nice thing about it is that you know
band with this cheap a

695
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,610
you know and these guys can really beast
a self-sustained from their

696
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,910
advertisements and they don't

697
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,240
they don't feel like they have to you
know represent the people who are

698
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,630
advertising their anyway

699
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,100
also have common common views because
they want their views to get out there

700
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,730
you know work

701
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,990
most the people advertising on the major
blocks right now are all

702
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,270
campaigns a Liberal Democrats who are
trying to get

703
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,380
you know progressive values out there so
there

704
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,080
the people can advertise on there are on
the same page is %uh so it's not really

705
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,900
an issue

706
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,930
up you know will they be beholden to
them because they

707
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,609
you know at their at their whim they can
turn off I know a

708
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,270
8 reales turned off advertising to
politicians after for a little while

709
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,560
after arm after the carey campaign

710
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,400
took daily Co sizzling of their site for
a little while because if something

711
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,750
offensive that Co said

712
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,240
on that he in he basically said fuck 'em

713
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,130
the mercenaries there were getting
killed yeah he does like mercenaries

714
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,040
he lost his temper on that on when those
poor guys were hung over the bridge

715
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,950
and you know the carey campaign all said
was being held responsible for what Co

716
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,610
said set

717
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,270
and eight years was so enraged by the
stupidity of all that

718
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:25,530
that he you know he just boulders
advertisers but I mean these guys make

719
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,820
plenty of money

720
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,080
to sell sustain all these things so it's
never really an issue because the

721
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,340
Internet is always going to be

722
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,450
you know cheap and what's so they they
never have run well I mean I out take

723
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:34,840
their

724
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,450
I I would take a more cynical long-term
view dislike you know history tells us

725
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,510
that basically any medium gets

726
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,920
unless you fight really hard getting to
institutionalized

727
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,310
and sclerotic com well it's not just
about money it's about

728
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:52,870
access I think it's going really
interesting to see the 30 or so bloggers

729
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,520
who are at the DNC 9c

730
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,230
like are they can be any more critical
than the mainstream press because

731
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,110
like wow we got this great Press Pass
and if we like

732
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:05,200
criticize carry maybe that'll be taken
away from us so

733
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,910
I think we should really watch what
happens over the next %uh few months

734
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,520
because I am at thats what kinda
controls allow the media just like

735
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,320
getting access

736
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,300
to the sources and if that is taken away
because they say something

737
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,020
batter critical I'm that's just as much
as being censored by their

738
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,880
money interests of course when the right
thing me ask you a question have you

739
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,200
read what how many

740
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,950
you guys read political blocs I love you
how many of you who read political blogs

741
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,440
read multiple political blocs

742
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,920
how many only read one okay so

743
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,780
the majority view read multiple blocks I
think that's our answer yes some blocks

744
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,520
gonna be corrupt

745
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,590
but you're gonna read multiple ones
model points you same issue

746
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:50,330
you'll be able to figure out the church

747
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,500
right but the whole point is that there
are literally

748
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,190
I'll like by television networks and
there are

749
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:01,280
bitterly hundreds of thousands if not
millions

750
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,280
web and me at least right now that's a
significant difference

751
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:18,410
do we have who do we have a mic

752
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:23,308
I'm because if you gonna talk for a long
time let other people here

753
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:28,029
on

754
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:31,349
a

755
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:34,469
we got publishing and cheap purses
broadcast ride

756
00:43:34,469 --> 00:43:37,949
what are the things that I actually like
speak to you

757
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,339
team got a lot of his moments in the
campaign not for the blog

758
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,660
meet-ups people said and that to me is
more

759
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:48,170
just a cheap way people communicate in
touch base

760
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:51,650
okay so it's really not doesn't really
matter

761
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,829
the blog or not it's just that ok and
got the internet communicate on the

762
00:43:54,829 --> 00:43:56,339

771
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:31,150
right okay it's so my question you guys
in the in the grand scheme of things is

772
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,839
like to come more popular and more

773
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:36,979
Orton to this growing you know
communication medium how do we cut the

774
00:44:36,979 --> 00:44:38,160
signal to noise ratio

775
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,160
and and where do we go from just having
served web pages that people dial into I

776
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,739
mean to you

777
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:46,619
they get smelly RSS feed stuff like that
and yet where the government

778
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:50,160
this the the way we were are actually
building a new system

779
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,239
on DailyKos has a really great way of
doing it where people can vote

780
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:57,219
on whether a proposed worthy being up
there not once they get really bad

781
00:44:57,219 --> 00:45:00,420
votes intro votes they get down to the
bottom or they disappear entirely

782
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,779
I'm we're developing a system with civic
space lab's

783
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,089
which is up there I using RSS feeds and

784
00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:10,150
web sites web content management systems
to

785
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,299
create active sites all over the country
smaller sites for people to organize

786
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:15,179
themselves

787
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:19,599
offline you know to work together and
each other's individual sites will all

788
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,759
connects to remain

789
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:24,880
syndication system so that anybody can
find out anywhere they want to volunteer

790
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,999
anywhere in the country you know for a
variety of different causes

791
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:33,969
and get their voices heard and you know
the organizations will find volunteers

792
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:36,309
they need volunteers will find the
organizations they need

793
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:39,429
and in all it'll all pass through using
RSS systems

794
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:42,859
on to to make that happen and getting
through the

795
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:46,369
you know the problems we have right now
with commenting there's a lot of lodging

796
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,150
actually talking about commenting a lot
of them are actually shutting off the

797
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:49,779
comments

798
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:52,779
because are getting so tired of all the
you know the negative

799
00:45:52,779 --> 00:45:56,089
energy in the angry republicans ranting
about how you know

800
00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:00,349
Edwards has bad Aaron like you know the
tired all that stuff they've been

801
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:01,259
turning it off but

802
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:05,219
these new systems at that we're
developing you know like their scoop

803
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:08,920
there's there's all these different
comment moderation systems that can

804
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,039
that can weed out the bad stuff and you
know and be make it such an interactive

805
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:13,829
system that

806
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,049
you know people definitely have a voice
are able to communicate can talk a

807
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:17,329
little

808
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:21,469
real quickly about the back and from
Pacific space is it based on

809
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:25,759
civic spaces based on Drupal on which
was created by a belief three German

810
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:26,299
guys

811
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:29,339
like four years ago wht

812
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:34,009
yet all PHP on and its open source and
everybody's building it together

813
00:46:34,009 --> 00:46:37,239
I'm civic spaces a political branding up
Drupal

814
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:41,289
that has boater filing I all kinds of
ways to participate

815
00:46:41,289 --> 00:46:44,910
Lake leading to help communities and
organizations develop their own

816
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,368
political systems within their

817
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:51,160
within their you know their place on the
web actually that's a kinda good segue

818
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:51,859
can you talk

819
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:55,538
just talk a little bit about what's
going on with Cara convention

820
00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:59,249
to affect you a very specific anecdote
about the dark side of

821
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:03,150
open content I'm iconic image with about
their own open sewer system called

822
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,390
lightning bug I'm a speech P Bass
back-end system where

823
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:09,650
every single comment or anything
personal site because these

824
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:13,140
email vetting process work everything
has to be reviewed by human eyes before

825
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:13,689
Spurs

826
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:16,868
publicly and the reason we had to do
that was because we had

827
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:20,509
a little and open system a former people
could personally think after the fact

828
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:21,179
moderation

829
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:24,489
and I am some Republican person it for
somebody

830
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:27,529
person our site that they're gonna bring
guns an attack the convention

831
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:30,949
um during RNC protests and

832
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:34,249
about week after that we got a call from
the secret service on my cell phone

833
00:47:34,249 --> 00:47:37,690
which I that was a joke at first I am I
was like

834
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,549
this is you know admin Washington secret
services when attending

835
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:45,079
Mike who the fuck is this getting me and
I am

836
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:48,729
as number call them back it was the real
secret service they

837
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:52,489
whoever posted the comment we don't we
don't know for sure what have we

838
00:47:52,489 --> 00:47:56,170
but we think the Commerce taken about
two hours later purpose the comment

839
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,469
contact the GOP news service and the
Secret Service said

840
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:03,170
this site has threats against the
president on it I'm getting to look into

841
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:03,440
it

842
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,920
and they did um so that's its it's a
real danger and Republicans are getting

843
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,749
as savvy as we are using the technology
they can a real up in Compton system

844
00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:12,900
used against us

845
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,019
not just in time Edwards but have been
making real threats they can get your

846
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:17,390
service confiscated

847
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:21,529
om in in a second so yeah it's kinda
funny because I am

848
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:24,869
in the political sphere I mean it all
the talk so weak you know like I

849
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:28,440
when corporations attacking and

850
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,440
at talk after talk yuri you learn about
all the different ways all the different

851
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,190
laws that people shut down information
flow

852
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:39,329
you know all other intellectual property
things trade secrets copyright

853
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:42,679
I we get political speech you will get
the added one

854
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:46,579
have that you know if you make anything
that can be construed as a threat

855
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:47,459
against the president

856
00:48:47,459 --> 00:48:51,390
or something and you can you know be

857
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,799
the whisked away and and shut down so
it's yet another its

858
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,949
you know so you could probably figure
out some way to set up like a plan

859
00:48:57,949 --> 00:48:58,829
weblog

860
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:02,209
which you could be shut down
simultaneously

861
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:06,249
in about 10 different ways I'm gonna
have to take like a one more question

862
00:49:06,249 --> 00:49:07,160
and then we'll get a

863
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,499
next panel is going to be more about
what people are doing

864
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:17,499
at the RNC CHC Graham guy in the red
there

865
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:22,079
the whole deal with Sherman Austin Lee
have

866
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,099
tried T and action or

867
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:30,259
any sort defense to prevent that from
happening to you

868
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,420
someone posted article link on this
forum

869
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,289
to whose sort of a blog but it

870
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:41,579
people who just post things that had
opens like someone posted a link to

871
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,420
another website

872
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,609
on that other website as bomb-making
instructions he got beat it by like

873
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,929
a SWAT team and I was doing it like a
year in prison they're gonna charge in

874
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:52,089
20 years under the Patriot Act

875
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:56,640
on these in federal prison right now um
have you sort of like considered had

876
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,368
would deal with something like that
happening consulting with the lawyer

877
00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:02,069
like

878
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:06,529
with what sort of things do happen do
you have anything in place to deal with

879
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:09,819
liking it an attack love that nature

880
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:13,229
when the iron is is whether best ways to
defend yourself against that is having a

881
00:50:13,229 --> 00:50:14,799
very large audience

882
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:18,179
are having a very good liar that yet
that happened I think was in Austin

883
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:22,179
are name Anne there's a link to the
anarchist cookbook

884
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:25,650
um and it wasn't even on a site is a
link to another site he's currently in

885
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,589
prison with

886
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:29,670
been working with people supporting
legally but when we had

887
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,559
are thing with the secret service like
first-world do not talk to the

888
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,339
authorities yourself

889
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:36,449
ever on always get a lawyer because you

890
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:40,219
don't know the laws well as a later this
week me the conduct and my CL you

891
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:43,249
who handled all the communication with
the secret service I'm

892
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:47,170
which can do a lot for you if you can
show like any kind as to if that is

893
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,150
really important

894
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,249
but again I'm if you have an open
content system and someone post

895
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:52,219
something

896
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:55,249
um the way the last dance now the
Patriot Act and

897
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:59,519
with you know other various local laws
you can be held accountable for it

898
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,189
and it's a real dangerous thing and a
lot of the

899
00:51:03,189 --> 00:51:06,819
you know judges I'm out there don't
really understand the difference between

900
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:10,659
your website link to another site our
stuff that you're advocating for

901
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:14,709
so I'm she's and open cunt insisting
just always has that danger

902
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:18,659
there's no moderation but on the other
hand they can't arrest all of us

903
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:22,859
and I think that's we're gonna close
this yes but they can try

904
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:26,569
I am that's right there's a large prison
industrial complex in this country

905
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:30,509
cell our time you have to thank
everybody and on behalf the panel

906
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:37,509
and now are ours up so thanks a lot

907
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:57,910
stack
