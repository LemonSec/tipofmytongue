1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,799
completely different topic lockpicking
there will be an ongoing lockpick

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,110
demonstration and training downstairs I
don't know how to call that floor I

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,340
think gorby your

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,019
affluent okay the the second floor a.m.

5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:17,270
so I will be here one hour of two deuces
over

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,619
so at two o'clock from 225 I will be
downstairs

7
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:25,470
and people can play would lock screen
pick locks but it's completely different

8
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,930
subject but

9
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,119
seems that many people are interested in
that so

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,890
I just had that mention a.m. also

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:37,500
there's a special picture made for this
conference that's available only in a

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,760
very limited edition

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,140
and it will be sold I think one hour
after the show

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,989
where they sell the t-shirts so if
you're interested in that

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,399
it's going to be 25 dollars but

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,590
depicts a really excellent I tested them

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,989
and it's it's really become a very nice
at its

18
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,370
am hmmm this is not the look picking Ben
Leah

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,789
I could her tried to grab one out of
mind

20
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:07,610
well anyway I think just just go check

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,350
here where they sell t-shirts 15 minutes
20 minutes after stock

22
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,380
and they will be for sale there but as I
said is going to be very limited edition

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,789
so

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,420
grab it fast if you're interested in it
because they will probably be sold out

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,310
pretty quick I don't think that will
make it with the supply we got till

26
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,020
before tomorrow before to look back
panel but

27
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,369
we'll see what happens but definitely
after dats

28
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:36,579
over after this it will be gone that's
for sure

29
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:42,869
okay where are you at it's a it's

30
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,930
also I'm very happy to see so many of
you because

31
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,689
on the other side pollution Irish
talking known go

32
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:54,520
but Bruce Schneier stalking and I really
expected it to be much less crowded as

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,339
it is now but I'm really thrilled to see

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,130
so many people interested in this
interesting topic a.m.

35
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,089
and and I going to cover the the radio
spectrum that sexually

36
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,128
what it's about and and what's there and
what you can do with it some

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,620
some things you can do with it are quite
amusing government is trying to encrypt

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,349
more and more

39
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,220
their signals so there's much less
interesting stuff for us

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,109
but still that there's many interesting
things to be found and even when

41
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:28,560
encryption is used on the signals still
some intelligence can be gathered

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,769
from that and I hope we can we

43
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,720
we can show you will cover a whole range
from

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,580
normal scanners leadership thing

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,310
yes give them an applause finally made
it

46
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:50,310
okay

47
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,180
position yes

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:08,180
yeah we had some problems copying files
from my

49
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,600
to its machine because that's the one
that's gonna be playing

50
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,190
some captures that I made in the
Netherlands and in Europe

51
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,950
some interesting signals I think you'll
find

52
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,290
hopefully highly amusing problem is of
course that the a lot of the interesting

53
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,709
stuff I kept it is in Dutch so it
doesn't mean anything

54
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,640
do you so therefore I made a selection
of some of the encrypt it signals and

55
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,430
we'll explain

56
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,670
how do you Krypton is done if you have a
chance for bypassing it or not

57
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,120
and and Anna brought some some video
clips

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,630
our police helicopter in Amsterdam EC's
transmitting

59
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:48,090
actually it's for internal use boats

60
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,730
if you have the right receiver it's a
nice broadcaster she was going on

61
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,580
in in that area and this does a smiley

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,560
interesting and entertaining video clips
but he said

63
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,510
is it working okay I am it's very told
you I'm sorry in Leawood

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,620
as I said technical issues on the

65
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,080
there's something called the
electromagnetic spectrum that I don't

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,580
know how many people here familiar with

67
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,700
its its makeup but there's a

68
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,709
there's a

69
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,480
broad spectrum of what we call bandwidth
but it's floating around in the air

70
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,250
everywhere from DC are very low cycles
per second

71
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,860
up to microwave in like frequencies and

72
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,410
we're talking about hundreds gigahertz a
band with

73
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,390
and there's a lot of low around there
live in his

74
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,099
easily intercepted Andy modulated in
either analog or digital modes

75
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,860
and I we want to show you some these
interesting signals that are floating

76
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,000
around what's out there

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,360
am well can be modulated what can be
what can be learned from things that you

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,130
can to modulate pictures from doing
traffic analysis as sorting

79
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,719
so our we're gonna show you our I what
looks like a time line really

80
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,910
but it's a a a graph showing

81
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,530
the US frequency allocations

82
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,260
and use a different somewhat in
different countries so what applies here

83
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,320
%ah are FCC equivalent in

84
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,419
benevolence may not necessarily show
show the same so

85
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,870
for instance a police frequencies that
Dutch police may use

86
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,040
will be used by maybe a television

87
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,720
station in this country so I'm gonna
switch over to

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,660
the spectrum see

89
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,820
can we get a

90
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,810
switch

91
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:46,810
resource

92
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,830
thinking video here now

93
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,279
wrong one special app

94
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,759
media a little later

95
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,229
used spectrum of the US alright in this
country the FCC

96
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,610
and certain other aspect to the federal
government here dictate

97
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,119
what goes where and I recommend you do a

98
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:15,909
you do a search for this if you're
interested just Goa go online to a

99
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,009
search for a

100
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,449
I US frequency allocations

101
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:25,519
or spectrum chart and you'll find it's
really big PDF honest

102
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:32,519
blow it up here and Jason details what
where

103
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:48,699
I can you read as I can see from here

104
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,310
okay

105
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,600
I am right to

106
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,400
right here you're seeing a megahertz
frequencies I

107
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,490
for instance a you have a TV
broadcasting in this country from 614

108
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,970
megahertz up to 698 megahertz

109
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,289
I you have cellular telephone
frequencies

110
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,409
right up here and

111
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,690
further down we

112
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:28,690
navigate around here bit

113
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,220
we have lower frequencies these are
international sure way frequencies

114
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,139
anywhere from say a %ah 2 230 megahertz

115
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,300
there's a lot of interesting up
international programming floating

116
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,009
around you can

117
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,960
listen to that on a regular shortwave
radio unit 50 get for fifty hundred

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,410
dollars

119
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:51,069
arm there's a above that you have the

120
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:55,229
VHF I which is about 30 to 300 megahertz

121
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:59,758
that has FM and TV broadcasts channel
maybe 213 in this country

122
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,789
option aircraft medications I

123
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,440
the federal government uses a lot of
frequencies in a VHF frequency range at

124
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,889
federal law enforcing agencies typically
in 160 170 megahertz region

125
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,659
secret service FBI DEA some analog some
digital some created

126
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,270
and like stuff you can hear and clear
above that you have UHF which is 303

127
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,830
3,000 megahertz or three get hurt if I
caught that those are would be your UHF

128
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,409
TV frequencies such an awesome 1369

129
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:32,649
I cellular and PCS a cellular

130
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:37,399
is usually in the 800 megahertz range
and PCS frequencies in the 1900

131
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,399
megahertz range

132
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,849
at GPS status GPS satellite navigation
devices

133
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,100
%ah there in that range was called the
l-band around 1.5 gigahertz your fifteen

134
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,930
hundred megahertz

135
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,560
microwave ovens wifi around 2.4
gigahertz

136
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,430
and wanna things are gonna talk about is
a microwave video surveillance

137
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,810
signals R&L band also which is around
1.5 gigahertz give or take a few hundred

138
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,550
megahertz

139
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,209
about that you got really high
frequencies about 3 3 gigahertz

140
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,510
up to several hundred gigahertz some
satellite TV stuff is in there

141
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,560
for gigahertz up to what's what's a KU

142
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,540
bencher cape and like 12 gigahertz arms
likely get DirecTV receiver that about

143
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,750
12,000 megahertz

144
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,810
up your satellite found sheehy reporters
in Iraq is over the asians at like fans

145
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,079
they're up in that rain shower lot a
military intelligence satellites

146
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,800
very hi several hundred gigahertz radar

147
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,480
I'll let defense military stuff in a
really high ranges

148
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,380
on a show of you example devices that
can be used to

149
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,870
airship somebody signals

150
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,860
okay a.m. what one other interesting
things

151
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,480
s as a radio spotter as you think we

152
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,690
we might be called is that I'm always
watching

153
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,880
at antennas on rooftops on cars on

154
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,050
us on CB radios or on two-way radios

155
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,529
and always trying to estimate what's the
frequency of that

156
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:08,779
and at one moment sure you're getting
really good at it because all these

157
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:09,620
manufacturers

158
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,630
they also make it more or less clear

159
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,180
that thats what type of antenna as usual
time

160
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,720
band and I'm I'm always interested in

161
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,880
if I see somebody walking around with a
radio two-way radio I think what

162
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,300
frequency could it be on

163
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,120
now the most excellent tool to

164
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,350
to find that out is what it has got here
it's an

165
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,600
optoelectronic scouts and s the name
mentions

166
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,470
it captures frequencies and what it does
is

167
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,050
it sweeps an entire band and if

168
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,680
I'll signal is above a certain level it
will display the frequency of that

169
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,720
which is really nice feature and also
the Scout can

170
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,890
memorize 400 different frequencies so
you can

171
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,160
stick it in your bag and and walk around
in an area and it might be

172
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,839
secured or whatever and you're
interested to listen to dis

173
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,699
communication

174
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,329
but if you're walking around there with
your scouts people Wednesday

175
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,089
what's going on but you can just carry
it under your pillow

176
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:10,930
and

177
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,000
you know look look at what's being
captured later

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
and also the nice thing is that you see
the frequency dats

179
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,150
capture but also the amount of times

180
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:25,030
it was captured which which also is a
nice features you only have one

181
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,930
if you see that a certain frequencies
only done one is probably a taxi driving

182
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,960
by life you

183
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,350
she people talking for 10 minutes and
you're standing next to them

184
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,130
you should have at least 50 Council that
same frequency

185
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,340
now at edges did is he triggered device

186
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,950
with his two way radio I don't know if
you can see

187
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,770
the oh yes you concede this is a is it
on the radio is the organizer using at

188
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,480
the conference

189
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,590
and they're just a few what's on UHF
frequencies we chose these frequencies

190
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,410
because they're at a ranger some of the
year

191
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,870
two-way radios that day amateur radio
operators can use which can be easily

192
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,550
modified operate at a frequency so we
chose as frequencies

193
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,320
said the latter range modified radius
and change another channel here

194
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,450
and key at the mike you can see the

195
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,570
are grafted bottom shows your signal
strength I'm broadcasting

196
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,940
raising a low free low train no signal
level now

197
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,070
and this thing will be Taylor you that
it's

198
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,940
its grab the frequency waiting 25
rematch if you're walking around

199
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,070
miss even get the beep a go

200
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,520
I'm we can put in vibrate mode so you
can just have it in your

201
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,270
in your coat and if you feel a vibrating
you can look at it discreetly in

202
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,430
see this transmitting near you now I
leave this thing on my ass all the time

203
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,440
on the windowsill

204
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,750
and it has a locking feature see if I
can a

205
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,090
Shea some frequencies lot on

206
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:53,260
see I have a special mound for this in
my car so when I'm driving in my car

207
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,319
it it also records frequencies of things
around me

208
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,850
which can be pager systems cell towers
whatever

209
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,640
but also nap sometime undercover police
car

210
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,510
dats is maybe following a suspect you
capture a lot of

211
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,740
very very interesting frequencies with
this thing and you can add MRR

212
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,210
are not interesting but you can find
frequencies that normally

213
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,240
nobody would ever find out because it's
either a band like it is doing now

214
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,940
I mean when I look at as radio I would
have figured it would be somewhere

215
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,640
between

216
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,580
440 and 470 but he was clever enough to
June it all the way up to four and in

217
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,140
ninety

218
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,569
a and if I wouldn't have a scout I would
never searched

219
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,940
their I don't think so at least well
yeah wouldn't wanna things very I do is

220
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,410
look at

221
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,290
we look at antennas you can judge for
the antenna generally what frequency

222
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,030
range

223
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,160
your your target is a is transmitting on
if you see someone to a radio

224
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,260
on and you wanna listen with their
they're talking about whether

225
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,319
whether I commercial amatuer

226
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,780
government whatever on if you have one
of these things you can

227
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,939
you can galley grab the frequency the
transmitting at and plug it into a

228
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,030
receiver and listen to it

229
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,390
if it indeed if digital transmission I
you need special

230
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,910
even more specialized equipment but on
this also logs frequencies and allows

231
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,949
you to download them

232
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,190
she can do some frequency analysis so
after a few weeks in this sitting on my

233
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,620
%ah I'll windowsill I could see that

234
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,130
um cordless phones

235
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,390
I am see %ah

236
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,420
that a taxicab frequency this is a
cellular

237
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,720
I secular found was nearby

238
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,160
these are visionaries misery said the
other day better

239
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,589
I didn't alice is a few months ago after
monitoring for about a month

240
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:44,750
an there something like a two or three
hundred at Philadelphia Police

241
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,540
a transmissions that were within a
couple blocks my house I picked up

242
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,079
things that are very close by which is
good you don't want to pick up sup

243
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,020
miles away cuz it be just too much
information I there is a

244
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,400
to FBI frequencies on lotta police

245
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,640
a political service frequencies and what
they're doing in my house

246
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,740
on alotta taxicabs

247
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,870
I miscible government on Family Radio
Service

248
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,490
I you know the SEL cheap two-way radios
you can buy their UHF

249
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,830
so anyway this allows you to see what's
being used around you

250
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,520
and you can program these frequencies
into a scanner or

251
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,840
I love scanners radio receivers you can
plug a cable directly

252
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,010
between this counter and that and he was
called reaction tuning so will actually

253
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,930
turn the radio

254
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,760
to the treatment she she can hear what's
going on in real time which is

255
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,390
a real pleasure personally I don't have
that because I don't like defector

256
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,860
it also choose to signals that I already
know I bogus

257
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,220
like better systems or FM radio stations

258
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,070
animal driving around and hearing all
these

259
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,830
signals that I'm not interesting in so
I've become very fast at

260
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:56,220
entering a frequency while driving and
maybe on the phone

261
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,920
but still still get it okay and and

262
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,820
I'm not as fast as the cable but it is
is close close

263
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,110
is a nice example of for beautiful small
receiver

264
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,790
dishes th right I it's actually a yeah
Thur

265
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,790
the R five hundred take case your GT
there

266
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,900
again

267
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,750
on that happens to be a sure way
frequency

268
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,100
that off the hook broadcast on simulcast
see

269
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,800
in here off the hook North and South
America on this frequency 7415

270
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,990
killers but on you can a

271
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,270
you can program any frequency into this
thing from from very low up to thirteen

272
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,060
hundred megahertz which covers a lot of

273
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,450
different users and it's very small
smaller than a pack of cigarettes

274
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,510
and you can keep in your pocket and a
live in FM but really I them

275
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,780
radio broadcast as well and runs out of

276
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,869
normal better couple a double A
batteries and it's very

277
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,100
very efficient power wise to a dozen a
doesn't rain a lot of her

278
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,300
power yet it's that's what I like in a
receiver that your

279
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,419
able to always did that you need to
change a battery pack

280
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,459
you can just pop in a few batteries
because it just happens that the most

281
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,350
interesting things

282
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:29,370
you better is empty at the time so I
really like getting a receiver

283
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,390
this is urs %ah as single-use

284
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,520
to receive nada not many different bands
on this but it

285
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,220
it's a shortwave receiver you can buy
these

286
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,840
at Radio Shack or other stores they said
there's a lot of signals

287
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,790
between a three in 30 megahertz she gets
more like here now

288
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,080
but these disciples radios are also

289
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,810
used by spy agencies and

290
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,280
you think twice by agencies since the
internets

291
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,860
there's been less and less of these
around but there are

292
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,260
on on shortwave there are stations very
high power stations

293
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,840
that only broadcast numbers and very
short

294
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,500
messages to don't seem to mean anything
but these are actually codes for

295
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,630
undercover people in the field or or
special agents in foreign countries

296
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,660
they don't wanna pick up the phone and
say hey you know I've accomplished

297
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,450
something or

298
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,300
where you have to go to today these are
prearranged

299
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,730
coach that are set and I hope that it
can play

300
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:39,730
sales are ideal rate you're doing it's
yeah I did a small one-time pad stats

301
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,980
that indeed correct it's it's
cryptographically secure

302
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,220
that you just prearranged a random
string and then

303
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,690
know if you can you can just plug it in

304
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,080
just

305
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,080
this is getting less

306
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:13,929
now it is going to try to find some of
the samples made of these

307
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,859
shortwave transmissions but some people
actually monitor all these messages even

308
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,859
though they don't seem to mean much

309
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,889
some of it of course is just filling up

310
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:28,090
space so people cannot by traffic
analysis see

311
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,299
when things are getting really
interesting so the broadcast at the

312
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:32,418
several in 24

313
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:37,479
or a certain interval I'm gonna play you
a a Cuban spy transmission

314
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:41,549
the a cuban intelligence agencies are
notorious for using this method is

315
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:42,320
transmitting

316
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,009
encoded messages one-time

317
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:49,289
you lucky that one time he's and a

318
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:55,070
this is a this one you can pick up very
easily %uh next

319
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:01,939
I

320
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,640
feel 50 full

321
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,950
better be at the hero

322
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,200
it be maybe been it

323
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,710
theme

324
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,000
I your 50

325
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,080
way baby call Peter

326
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,620
pretty K that's a cubans

327
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,299
I here's a MI six British intelligence
on

328
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:32,639
is kind of interesting will turn the
broadcast before this to their field

329
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,450
operators can

330
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,980
can recognize that this is the signal is
intended for them on

331
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,100
ended the chain is an all-british folk
song called the latent Lincoln Shire

332
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,750
poacher and after after the a-ten

333
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:51,750
you'll hear some coded messages

334
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:59,500
the the fun it's really kinda boring to
listen to but it's

335
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:17,029
what's interesting is a you can use in
traffic analysis on these and they found

336
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,750
the to

337
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,510
occasionally a there's there's an
increase in

338
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,000
in the level traffic in these
transmissions up

339
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,019
just before or during major
international incidents

340
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:33,600
on for instance at the MI six
frequencies are a little more active

341
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,990
I'll this before the the go for invasion
this is a

342
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:44,990
next on a place them aside Israeli
intelligence

343
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,750
ass you could hear you you can help ease
yourself

344
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,429
all right here if you don't have to
share my radio

345
00:21:53,429 --> 00:22:00,429
made in Mexico DX trainers got and
activators but it's a couple shoppers

346
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,100
you control right

347
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:09,100
for free

348
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,290
ass

349
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,870
desist letters and numbers

350
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,870
yeah dark wanna play this one now which
is

351
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,180
my favorites we nicknamed her Cynthia

352
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,760
because she has a letters in her name
see II

353
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,760
a the

354
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,159
there where r

355
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,900
or there are 0

356
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,450
there are

357
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,620
uses your tax dollars at work tomorrow

358
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:05,440
monitor along here there

359
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,740
you had the you're also a these are

360
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,840
aren't not all of the year country to do
this

361
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,649
doesn't the countries around the world
and I really found it this is the most

362
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,680
effective way

363
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,470
to get messages to the field operatives
on you could have killer Robert feel

364
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,700
operatives out there with a really
compact devices that had a satellite

365
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,360
receiver to receive digital messages

366
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,780
but you know what other way to to like
blow your cover them to be caught hold

367
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,600
one of these things

368
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,300
in in motion the world have English a
portal shortwave radio is

369
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,850
is the normal thing the everybody has a
radius are we waiting for listening to

370
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,650
news in this country people always
ensure we very much been rushed the

371
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,820
world that's the normal

372
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,330
there stayed on most people in the world
get their news and information

373
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,060
entertainment over shortwave radio now
this country but so

374
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,200
never country and if you have any sense
it's not a big deal so it doesn't blow

375
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,830
your cover

376
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,560
you enter america yeah exactly but on

377
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,500
you can get is pretty regularly on a lot
over shortwave receiver here's another

378
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,840
one

379
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,909
okay there's another I've receiver

380
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,480
on you can't buy this receiver in this
country this is actually the control

381
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:14,920
head

382
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,520
for a a for Sony shortwave receiver
which air

383
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,350
I ordered from a the United Arab
Emirates Dubai

384
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:25,680
on several 2600 staffers had this radio
in the car

385
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,050
suck up a hundred dollars at included
the shipping on

386
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:33,600
its regular am/fm cassette stereo like
20 watts per channel for your car but it

387
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,680
also receives all im

388
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,080
international sure way bans so it's
kinda like heaven XMR

389
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,429
or Sirius Satellite Radio om as far as
diversity programming available

390
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:46,590
in your car behind to pay a subscription
fee and you can even listen to

391
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,830
spy numbers transmissions if you're so
inclined are you driving around late at

392
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,129
night

393
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:57,130
here's another receiver

394
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,720
that a that has unique feature that

395
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,050
it receives a video transmissions not
just a TV

396
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,560
but a not just broadcast television but
television

397
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,220
that could originate from my I covert

398
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:18,570
spy cameras the UC see around

399
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,080
love his cock damages your router wired
but some of them are wireless

400
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,480
and mary has an interesting examples
over

401
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,240
wireless video from outlets but Dutch
police helicopters

402
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,250
yes correct we could go into that

403
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,040
the only thing I want to say about this
icon receiver is that it doesn't work

404
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,540
well

405
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:40,700
on 2400 megahertz band 24 megahertz band

406
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,230
probably rings a bell because it's the
same band were able to 11 is

407
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,970
it's a band open for a lot of

408
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,590
usages and dams and police has been
using it for many years to transmit

409
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,560
their video down

410
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:58,159
from the helicopter to base where day
coordinates shortened

411
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,160
activities very insensitive it's not
very sensitive receiver

412
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,270
if you have a preamplifier and an
external antenna

413
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,610
on you can do a little bit better but
this is really designed for a

414
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,470
arm really weak signals like from a
thats police helicopter

415
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,210
well your not gonna receive it here
anyway know but but

416
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,880
if you if you're interested in in
receiving

417
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,920
them

418
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,530
digital cameras in 2.4 gigahertz known
by dish receiver because it just doesn't

419
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,120
work

420
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,230
I'm not sure if there is a handheld
receiver did us a better job in

421
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:34,730
on there isn't yet you think there would
be but it's just an upmarket I think you

422
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,430
need specialized equipment its

423
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:43,290
few thousand dollars generated to do
that sort of thing now

424
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,100
I i jus border separate receiver at
radio flea market

425
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,970
for I think 150 dollars but it's been
definitely

426
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,800
worth the money of course when you buy
such a thing

427
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,540
when you buy receiver the police doesn't
work a lot with these

428
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,260
helicopters maybe in the Netherlands to
do it ten times a year

429
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,340
eight times a year so you buy this
receiver and to just waiting and waiting

430
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,170
and waiting

431
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,060
and watch in New Jersey you know there
was something with a police helicopter

432
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,360
and then I miss it because I was at work

433
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,850
so a but the the first video I captured

434
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,460
actually was like personally like like a
wet dream you know did you

435
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,070
turn on your thing and and and and
images you see

436
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,540
really is really really cool I hope I
can

437
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:34,540
share it with you now but what what I
heard was that there were some

438
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,830
ask what the riots that some squatters
courthouses

439
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,899
and the police was we're going to force
them out

440
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,450
and the circumstance Qantas you know
that they don't like that so

441
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,160
the day fight to police and one of the
tactics they use is that they climb on

442
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,760
the roof

443
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,240
and throw stuff down most the time it's
not heavy stuff it's not

444
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,350
tables and stuff there pretty pretty
nice guys

445
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,720
but but but they throw paints and what
you going to see here is a small battle

446
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,490
between the Dutch dams and police I was
a water cannon trying to blow these

447
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,290
people of

448
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:12,389
the no really and these people trying to
blind

449
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,490
the want to throwing device with paint

450
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,010
and diz what you're going to see I'll
Lexmark after

451
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:22,629
okay talk about the other

452
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,100
the other me job and there's also
another video data showed

453
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,650
later after dirt's

454
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,600
that is from an anti-war

455
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,070
demonstration the

456
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,070
American consulate in Amsterdam there
was going to be big

457
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,850
anti Iraq war demonstration showed a

458
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,049
food a large amount of red containers

459
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:51,359
arounds that building to make sure that
nobody would get

460
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,830
even close to it and yeah people came to
these containers and

461
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,249
just protest and at the ends

462
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:03,409
some riots broke out and some stones
were being thrown to the police in

463
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,789
stuff like that and then what I hope to
show you later on

464
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:10,229
if its computer works

465
00:29:10,229 --> 00:29:14,840
is how'd I don't know how you call it in
English

466
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,070
SWAT team okay did a SWAT team

467
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,109
they have special small units did go
into the field into these

468
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:25,678
and a target to certain individual you
know they say

469
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,190
get the guy with red trousers or
whatever and then day

470
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,389
will arrest him grab him and

471
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:35,970
drag him into a policemen in a secure
area

472
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,559
and and it's all being taped by this
police helicopters I'm just sitting at

473
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,210
home you know

474
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:45,769
having this premium channel the now it's
it's really is very very nice

475
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:50,519
a.m. and I hope I can share it with you
keep talking your

476
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,820
come on a.m. yeah

477
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,599
now we're just just have to wait said

478
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,989
yeah okay and another topic that and I a
very interesting

479
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:06,210
is once you get to know to spectrum you
also see

480
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,519
blind spots you she spots that are
supposedly

481
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,539
unused or unmarked or you know people
say well there's nothing to see in this

482
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:14,739
part of the spectrum just

483
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:19,139
you know keep on walking nothing to see
here discourse the most interesting

484
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:23,109
and most the time you will find its

485
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:30,109
okay don't have come

486
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,700
but but but I'm not talking about
finding bugging devices

487
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,790
it's it's one of the things that is

488
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:43,010
logical once you know the spectrum I
want you know how to find receivers

489
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,330
a.m. that you will be able to find
hidden transmitters

490
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,320
even if they're small and low powered
its interesting to find out

491
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,110
where are people hiding in what part

492
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:57,309
frequency spectrum people hiding these
devices

493
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:01,480
and what type of people are dead of
course the criminals and people who

494
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,530
don't trust their wives

495
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:05,820
but also the government's they also use
bugging

496
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,840
I think in the states to use much
Morrison in Europe although in the

497
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,500
Netherlands

498
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,120
laws have been passed in in the
Netherlands

499
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,280
law enforcement is allowed now to to
book your house and to pack your bedroom

500
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,629
in

501
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:23,170
it's it's yeah it's not getting pretty
some books already have been found in

502
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:23,950
the Netherlands

503
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,330
they operate around 850 megahertz in

504
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,620
spread spectrum modulation which means
that

505
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,370
with the normal receiver you will not
find it means that over a large amount

506
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,400
of frequencies

507
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,840
the signal ish smear doubts and it's
it's

508
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,690
yeah it's very difficult to to find
these kind of transmitters

509
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,870
at this got a very beautiful device
would spectrum analyzer

510
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,130
that we will demonstrate little later on
and it will actually show you

511
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:58,179
in real time what's going on in a
certain area frequency band them

512
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:05,179
squatters

513
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:14,309
it's not ans is not on screen i think im

514
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:20,640
source

515
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,370
ok

516
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:27,090
issue

517
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:34,090
but it's not showing

518
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:43,020
we don't see the image its in the the
box

519
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,720
missions

520
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:12,160
anybody with some knowledge about video
assistant

521
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:36,230
bear with us bear with us

522
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:02,059
yeah or something okay X displaced

523
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:07,620
screen

524
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,710
okay what you see here is

525
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,020
the video helicopter a and its

526
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,099
did this this is actually the first
image it I ever saw

527
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:21,859
so I was you know tuning it and then
finding it and then I heard

528
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:26,779
on scanner I heard some people say your
move a little bit too dry to dry just go

529
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,280
to that

530
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,100
area there and you actually see

531
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,110
somebody on the roof drawing small
pellets of pain

532
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,900
in in in in in a little while there
there there we go

533
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:45,900
a.m. and there's yeah

534
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,110
no but really this this this is

535
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,610
so rewarding that the do did you get
this device

536
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,090
and then all of a sudden you know you
see this and I i had the biggest smile

537
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,170
on my face

538
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:04,170
since a long time that lineup and and
and and the funny thing is

539
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,840
that the

540
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,990
the funny thing is is that is the the

541
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:18,500
the water is slow so this guy sees it
coming and unjust then there's ducks

542
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:25,500
oh you had record ok

543
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:35,450
go back fullscreen here you can actually

544
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,509
on the top corner now you can see the
car throwing the

545
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:46,510
the the water to this guy I okay

546
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,540
this

547
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,640
I'm okay so that that that that was
throwing the water

548
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,650
a.m. here you can see the helicopter
that actually was a part of the

549
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,390
helicopter

550
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:11,190
flying into 22 damn samaria sorry bout
the encoding of the video its

551
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,040
it's not very welcome

552
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,520
them but you can actually see it fly
over Amsterdam

553
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,290
then it's getting its direction that
people say you know zoom into that in

554
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:24,950
that area

555
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,940
so it's going to look where am i exactly

556
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,370
and then go into this area where did the
consulate is

557
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,220
know you can see the red containers in
in a line

558
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:44,220
thing its Hui cedars human capabilities
of this

559
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,910
camera I mean just you know just a few
seconds before

560
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,120
we had a big part of Amsterdam but now

561
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,549
and and what you will see now is that
they will put an extra lense

562
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,040
in front of the camera so you will see
blur for second

563
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,380
and now it's huge in even closer

564
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,789
and and they can release you mean to

565
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:10,789
to yeah videos hang

566
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:42,660
slow

567
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:57,350
I'm afraid we're facing a blue screen of
death

568
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,090
okay

569
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,170
a.m. okay

570
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,740
thing is a.m. I i feel bad about this so

571
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,860
if people want to see the clip date they
can get a copy from me just

572
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,260
all put a CD here and if you see me
walking around to make a few CDs and and

573
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:22,630
put

574
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,870
material on and feel free to distributed

575
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,900
I mean has been broadcast that so I
don't feel

576
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:35,900
okay

577
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,280
the actually I'm not sure if it's legal
to record it so I'm

578
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:47,280
well

579
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:50,599
the there actually is a radio emitter by
the name of

580
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,630
for scaling-up who was a Dutch guy

581
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:57,069
whose recording all this he says that
you know it's an open band

582
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:01,790
and he's a radio ham hamintor and
therefore he's allowed to record it and

583
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,450
he makes

584
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,369
all the samples available on the website
so check on

585
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:09,650
on the website for or take on Google at
zulu

586
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:16,450
double 0 a and Selinger and and you will
find a whole lot of

587
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,060
of Dutch police

588
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,540
camera that that that that he recorded
and you can download Eclipse

589
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,720
as you see them you but I i would like
to give it another try

590
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,410
if possible okay we could try my

591
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:41,410
guns

592
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,240
well I i don't have the weapon this but
it's

593
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,359
saludable 0 zulu 00 that's the call sign
of

594
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:53,180
the helicopter and the guys name is
Selinger

595
00:39:53,180 --> 00:40:00,180
or livingstone i think is his name yeah
if you and a police helicopter

596
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,960
shoe you will definitely fines

597
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,780
gonna see if my laptop does a better job
of playing these

598
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:17,780
video files for you anyway now it's your
turn

599
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:32,960
later

600
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:38,580
what we're looking at here is a year are
receiving station where

601
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,230
this the transmissions we're just
looking at could be received from

602
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:45,510
are typically a finest tops have some
government buildings

603
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:52,420
on this was a supply by manufacturers
this equipment lotta times these

604
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,300
video surveillance sources on coming
from a helicopter for coming from a

605
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:55,910
fixed

606
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:59,009
a fixed place it could be hidden camera

607
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:04,170
on the high demand a lot of interesting
things now shows an example to that but

608
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,730
here's a

609
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:08,640
here's what on top a French answer a
federal on fortune building here in

610
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,650
here in the States is another at

611
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,210
picture a bit what's interesting is this
aside from different from this

612
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,640
and a satellite in tennis is not
pointing up in the air this is pointed

613
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,069
to

614
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:24,470
horizontally or sometimes in a downward
angle the target is now the picture from

615
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,160
the side

616
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,700
%ah this is a picture I took it a few
days ago in philadelphia

617
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,910
I miss him in on this this is the
federal a

618
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:37,859
Federal Building in philadelphia

619
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,000
and if you see in the top right here

620
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,310
that's a microwave video surveillance

621
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,460
I'll antenna and if you're on the ground

622
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:53,130
look up you can barely see this thing so
a this is pointed certified Northwest

623
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:58,530
so %ah the last time the fed in
philadelphia were using this thing

624
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,860
his picture they were monitoring had
been monitoring

625
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,910
video surveillance transmission in
Northwest Philadelphia summer

626
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,680
northwestern

627
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,160
just our site

628
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,549
at another shot

629
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:16,619
ground another shot at it and

630
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,619
sometimes these are hidden in a common

631
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:23,080
looking objects that you don't think
twice about seeing stays

632
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,640
sure you've all seen these

633
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,700
our company transformers %ah

634
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,280
sometimes used on me cans like this on
telephone poles

635
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,840
and I show you couple other examples
hidden platforms

636
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,990
the teaser these hidden

637
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,390
%ah things are and here's a

638
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:47,700
this is from a a law enforcement
conference

639
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,359
took some pictures at that a box it has
a disorder things is this box be mad on

640
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,220
utility pole

641
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,710
I am disagree box

642
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,970
and here you see a microwave antenna
similar WiFi antenna

643
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,810
there's a camera Anna high-power lands
in lands

644
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:09,590
here is a a a radio use to receive the
signals to control it remotely

645
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,780
I make a turn on/off I'm zoom in

646
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,430
sometimes point in different directions
there's another shot over

647
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,419
differ model and hear some more
interesting a

648
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:28,119
hidden closures this is one that used a

649
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,859
at hidden inside what looks like a blast
concrete cinder blocks

650
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:36,299
here's a you probably all seniors
pedestals word cable TV company your

651
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,950
phone company hasn't wanted these things
in someone's front lawn

652
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:43,450
well not necessarily is there a junction
box inside there could be one is

653
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,500
on these hidden cameras you can see the
air microwave antenna here for

654
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,500
transmitting a signal

655
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,130
signaled

656
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,000
maybe sure your show 1 more video that
was a

657
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
it was taken locally in Philadelphia

658
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:08,129
from a a see

659
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:14,589
these

660
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:20,020
here

661
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:27,020
okay ago

662
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:34,290
women

663
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,950
this was taken in South Philadelphia on
a loop this thinks it's not very long

664
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:43,380
this was taken from a utility pole

665
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:48,170
and it's a surveillance at the net an
organized crime

666
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:51,610
suspect and it's interesting you can see
when he leaves the year

667
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,080
when he leaves the building your is
looking a left and right

668
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,870
and all around to see if anybody's
watching him but in fact that he's not

669
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,799
looking up in the chilly palmer this
camera's

670
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,080
and this was a intercepted

671
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,180
mmm not too long ago in a in South
Philadelphia area

672
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,379
and this guy is in prison right now but
a

673
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,470
but a this was used as with a lot of
other evidence wiretaps and so forth to

674
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:16,830
work

675
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:21,600
to put together case against organized
crime people in philadelphia to

676
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,660
the signals are floating around you
don't realize that there's probably

677
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:26,759
active surveillance going on right here
right now in New York

678
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,590
on probably gonna be a lot going around
the RNC convention here coming up

679
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:34,280
and a lot of it is not DigiLink ripped
it because it's more complicated

680
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,120
do that and less reliable than discrete
and analog video and

681
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,490
receiver to pick the stuff up on
something go to Radio Shack and by

682
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,460
so on by let you know that this the
stuff's going on all the time

683
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,090
and have to be aware try to

684
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:56,090
good I'm me

685
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:03,500
with binoculars if you look very
carefully and some of these boxes on

686
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,190
polls

687
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,420
if you see a a small hole arm that could
be there

688
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,980
the lentil but frankly think they
conceal these pretty well so they're

689
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:17,980
hard to tell

690
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm there's other types of equipment out
there on is a company called a

691
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:31,300
Wavecom that makes easy consumer video
link units

692
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:36,270
and that you can modify them %ah

693
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:42,580
otherwise issues jackie is very
specialized test equipment okay I'm

694
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,480
going to

695
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,040
keep it this mod because sometimes the
image freezes

696
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,430
and I manually have to drag it a little
bit for but as you can see here

697
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,120
Shino few of the area and 20

698
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,480
what you actually she here is

699
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,320
the van with undercover police

700
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,340
just targeting suspects

701
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,980
to all these people you see here are
actually police officers

702
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,090
and at this moment you know that just

703
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:16,450
watching the scene and pointing out
world is one guy might grab later on

704
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,619
and what they do indeed grab somebody is

705
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,750
actually quite interesting they target
him then they walk behind him

706
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,660
and for about 50 meters and then with a
team of

707
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:31,190
people they start running and when they
run

708
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,220
day grab day decrepit

709
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,660
suspect behind and drag him around but
you'll

710
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:42,470
she did happen later on a.m. here to
just zooming in on somebody who hasn't

711
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,280
done anything

712
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,200
anti obviously finds out that they're
watching him

713
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,270
and he s got a sign that says please
stop this

714
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:54,240
which is

715
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,810
which is rather funny but but but you
can see I mean this this is digitally

716
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:02,150
captured show the actual quality is is
even a little bit better

717
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:06,109
and you can definitely from this police
helicopter identified

718
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:09,500
people okay here we go the

719
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,230
some this is okay here here to bringing
in a

720
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,590
suspects you can see the middle of the
Scream

721
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:21,000
Dez on the cover the day catch someone
and they will

722
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,609
deliver him to one of these events she
will see

723
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:31,180
and a special knock on the door to open
it signaling

724
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:34,859
we're good guys open up and

725
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:38,109
and their egos and then you will see now

726
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:42,170
some police tactics on on the top of the
screen that the running here on on the

727
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,020
left of the screen

728
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,740
the running running in grabbing him did
it did you see I could go back

729
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,910
just get a running start so when they
grab them

730
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,600
you're done okay up unscreened ago

731
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,940
running running running for the guy with
the white-run bank and you really don't

732
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,960
stand a chance and

733
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:03,450
and this is actually quite interesting
to see all these police tactics

734
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,780
through their own eyes actually think
you guys a.m.

735
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,290
and and yeah it's it's but but

736
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:14,390
you know being able to see this is
really really interesting now damn some

737
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,440
police has bought

738
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,870
scrambler show they're scrambling a lot
of these video signals

739
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:24,150
I think our time is up but that will not
prevent me from

740
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,310
keeping this video playing so people can
see

741
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:30,450
just for a few more minutes while the
other person is setting up

742
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,720
stop the what you will also see

743
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,200
cock

744
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,270
just that there's one more as one more
coming up and as you will see one of

745
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,310
them will get away

746
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:47,330
and actually throw throw something away
the guy with brown

747
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:51,009
shirt here is going to throw something
away right now

748
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:54,020
la jolla a you know

749
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,350
so even even if they arrest him he
thinks that they didn't see that the

750
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,690
through something away a.m. the

751
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:04,840
other shot that you will see but I will
not be talking when you see it a

752
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,170
is when they switch through im to
infrared

753
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,580
these helicopter cameras also have
infrared on them

754
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,920
a.m. and they can select if something

755
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,090
did they go if something in white is

756
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:21,320
a is in hot object or if something in
black is an art object

757
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:26,570
us you can see now a.m. so I'm just
gonna let this play for for a few

758
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,400
seconds to a few minutes till its

759
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,700
those run out Chuck

760
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:32,870
yep
