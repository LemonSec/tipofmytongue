1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:04,270
I the last one have this gentleman
followed

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,040
Jello Biafra and made a statement about
how I didn't exactly agree with the

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,950
politics have mister B offer but that's
what these conferences are about

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,590
sharing information and different
opinions

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,190
I Steve from bomb is going to discuss
privacy

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:28,190
how it's dead get over it it's true is
this working

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,090
try this

8
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,469
it's true that during h2k I had

9
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,290
rather strong difference of opinion
Jello Biafra

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,940
unfortunately during the past two years
I have been

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,250
driven a lot well

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,350
kicking and screaming a lot closer to
his position

13
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,610
in the past two years

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,409
we've seen in this country an enormous
arose in a personal privacy

15
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,529
personal liberty personal rights and a
specially

16
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:18,789
right to privacy it has always been
considered in this country

17
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:21,810
to be a basic human right

18
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,639
the right to privacy the right to be
left alone

19
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:32,369
as it was once described by the Supreme
Court that ride

20
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,669
and the ability to keep your

21
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:42,669
affairs private even your most intimate
affairs private has now been completely

22
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:43,429
eliminated

23
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:47,779
there's been a lot of

24
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:52,348
debate over the past two years about the
Patriot Act about

25
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:56,649
Total Information Awareness terrorist
information

26
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,450
Action Network

27
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:05,040
the dark activities what I hope to do
today

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
is to give you on of information more
than enough information

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,930
regarding just what's available

30
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,750
out there on each individual person and
to help you make

31
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,640
an informed decision about the Patriot
Act about

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,640
darkness projects about frankly the
upcoming election

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,750
wozniak gave me the best segue that he
possibly could when he started talking

34
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,140
about

35
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,110
what was fundamentally american in this
country

36
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,379
there's always been a level playing
field

37
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,268
or in theory a level playing field
between the government and the private

38
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:50,989
citizen

39
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:55,480
supposedly the government was not
entitled to anything that you weren't

40
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,369
entitled to

41
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,810
information was supposed to be free if
there was a property record

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:07,019
you're entitled to that record if there
was a voter registration you're entitled

43
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,730
to see that voter registration

44
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,858
if someone compiled the file on you

45
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,790
you're entitled to see that file if for
no other reason than to

46
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:22,150
correct the errors what has happened
over the past two years like never

47
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,359
before in the history the United States

48
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,760
is that your most intimate secrets

49
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,679
your most confidential information has
been catalogued

50
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,159
cross-reference data mined

51
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,879
compiled conglomerate and made available

52
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,018
to the US government by private industry

53
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,540
and because it's been made available by
private industry

54
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,709
Lauren regulation doesn't control you
have no right to look at it Freedom of

55
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:56,449
Information Act doesn't cover

56
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,030
now there are

57
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,780
very very good reasons for information
to be

58
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,489
out there to be available if you're
hiring a nanny

59
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,530
you should be able to determine if this
man he was a child molester

60
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,159
or charged with assault if you have a
housekeeper

61
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:19,889
you have a right to know if this
person's been arrested for burglary if

62
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,549
there's a school bus driver

63
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,638
you really have a right to know if that
person is a drunk driving conviction

64
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,000
before he drives a Kia

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,449
if you hire an employee

66
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,940
it's probably useful to know if this
person's over been involved in an act

67
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,349
the workplace violence

68
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:40,060
if you lend somebody money you should
know what their

69
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,820
their credit ratings all of these things
make sense

70
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,150
they especially make sense when you talk
about

71
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:55,150
public figures you have a right to know
what John Kerry's military records

72
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,840
you have a right to know what george
bush in

73
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,289
and Cheney's financial dealings were
information

74
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:07,430
should be available to everyone

75
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:14,430
people that's thats basic American
philosophy what I'm going to do over the

76
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:18,919
next half hour

77
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,669
or less is give you

78
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,930
the reader's digest version

79
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,180
databases privacy

80
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,510
what's available out there and then
gonna take one or two victims

81
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,039
from the audience wanna to volunteers
from the audience

82
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:45,039
and I'm going to unfortunately I just
been handed a social security number

83
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,000
unfortunately

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,550
when we get to that the person who
social security number this is gonna

85
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,550
have to stand up

86
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,349
volunteer market is rather we're on an
Asus says

87
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:02,690
probably jack valenti's Social Security
arm

88
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:09,690
yeah I'm not system

89
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,780
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
give you the readers digest survey

90
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,419
what's out there I'm then going to
demonstrate what's out there rather

91
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,469
graphically by logging onto

92
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,699
what's called a perforated a personal
reference database and running a couple

93
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,570
people here

94
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,870
and then we're going to do questions and
answers because frankly your questions

95
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,500
usually elicit better information that I
would everything to

96
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,729
speak about on my own arm

97
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:46,169
I'm going to start by start this
presentation by picking first on

98
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:48,080
Democrats than Republicans

99
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,520
so don't pick an inopportune moment to

100
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,490
sure all love you

101
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:06,490
have gone unseen Fahrenheit 9/11 I was
asked by

102
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:12,370
a buddy of mine too take a look into
Michael Moore's background out of

103
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,270
curiosity

104
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,099
the first thing you do when you
investigate someone is you

105
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,180
do what's called developing a doubt the
fires which even though I don't have

106
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,060
much regard for mister more I do have
regard for his privacy so I've

107
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,620
redacted a social security number and
address anything

108
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,000
remotely personal and by the way you
could go down to the local voter

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,870
registration office here in manhattan

110
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,699
and get all the information that I
redacted I just chose not to be the one

111
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:40,560
to give it to you

112
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,320
when I investigated Michael Moore

113
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,949
I thought that I was gonna find toner
records in Michigan Flint Michigan

114
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:55,520
you know all the various places where
his origin supposedly or

115
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,180
in fact I found out that Michael Moore
for the past 10 years has been a New

116
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,820
Yorker

117
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,870
before the he was in DC

118
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,099
I also found out

119
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,940
no ice or at least I hope that everyone
in this room whose

120
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,590
over the age of 18 is a registered voter
and I'm sure you all know

121
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,990
that you can only be a registered voter
in one place leisure Michael Moore

122
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,219
Michael Moore

123
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:31,120
by the way Michael Moore when he was
taken to task by the press about being a

124
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,620
chauffeur

125
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,150
democrats he said I'm an independent
voter not a registered democrat

126
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,929
according to the Associated Press

127
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,159
through Michael this is his current

128
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,240
New York State voter registration here
in manhattan

129
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,209
he is active he is a democrat he is also
active

130
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,650
in Michigan I'll

131
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:01,230
night you might wonder why that is any
basic investigation by the way involves

132
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,350
the internet simply because it's huge

133
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,100
and it's free so I went to Michael Moore
dot com

134
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,890
and I saw a quote where he urges
everyone he highlights

135
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,230
17 swing states 17 heavily contested
States

136
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,870
any servers to live in a place like New
York you gonna head over to a place like

137
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,800
New Mexico

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,930
and register to vote their own

139
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,020
in theory influence the election I guess
that's what Michael

140
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,529
word ran back to Michigan which he shows
contest that's

141
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:38,720
New York Israel does not contest adolf
hitler could run in the democratic party

142
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,449
line

143
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,760
I've now

144
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,130
picked on the democrats

145
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:54,130
when we pick on the republicans and as a
guy who voted for Bush last

146
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,160
SARS ask me what I'm going to do this

147
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,710
I'm sorry to say

148
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,860
malfeasance on the part republicans

149
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,760
is a lot scarier this if you can follow
this I tried to

150
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,990
have my office lay this out

151
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,400
in a fairly coherent former

152
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,339
you follow this let me know I will go
back

153
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,339
this is important

154
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:34,870
and this is true in the nineteen
eighties there was a drug smuggler

155
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,360
we're gonna call H any of you doing the
most basic internet research

156
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,750
ages H was a pile

157
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,940
flu lots and lots and lots a call

158
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,930
from the Bahamas into the US got grab by
the first

159

he agreed to be an informant and i'm
quoting

160
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,550
in drug trials from Gainesville to
Chicago

161
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,510
lots and lots and lots drug trials each
has no criminal record as far as I can

162
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:04,960
tell

163
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,110
each also is not a bit hacker

164
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,240
a real hacker on a cracker hacker

165
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,640
traditional sense and a fantastic
program

166
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,330
told any such a company called database
technologies

167
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,540
database technologies db2 was one

168
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,689
the best in its time

169
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,100
and one of the first database services

170
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,839
with information on people made
available to collection agencies and

171
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,150
eyes and law enforcement everything from
driving records the motor vehicles

in 1998 1999

182
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,850
to do what's called cleansing voter
rolls florida is one of the states were

183
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,220
if you're convicted felon disenfranchise
you don't have the right to vote

184
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,910
DB cheese

185
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,689
through matching incredibly inaccurate
match

186
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:39,650
have criminal records voter registration
rolls causes

187
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,850
a hundred and twenty thousand people in
florida be yanked from voter

188
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,530
registration anybody

189
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,130
tell me who you think these voters war

190
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:56,000
minorities

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,300
overwhelmingly Democratic next person

192
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,510
tell me by how many votes george bush

193
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:10,200
won the state of Florida 627 but you're
close

194
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,620
the NAACP

195
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,430
sued db2 DBT later got bought a bike

196
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,070
good company ChoicePoint and ChoicePoint
settled

197
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,310
the NAACP as part of the settlement

198
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,810
they admitted to 80,000

199
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,329
voters being improperly disenfranchise

200
00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:38,240
in fact in one county alone

201
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
was six thousand 627 which

202
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,890
cosmically 6,000 exactly more than bush
won

203
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,689
among the people incorrectly
disenfranchised

204
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,459
with a header the voter registration
office to give you an idea

205
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,100
up how screwed up the data processing
was

206
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,740
I don't think you have to be

207
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,200
a rocket scientist to follow this guy
gets introduced the job Bush

208
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,610
guy gets hired by the state of Florida
guy

209
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,820
ranks of Democrats state of Florida
decides the election

210
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,480
this guy basically decides who votes in
the election

211
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,699
now I'm not a conspiracy

212
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:25,940
I'm not one of these people who believe
that we did really land on the moon it

213
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,319
was a sound stage in

214
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:30,420
all these various wild

215
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,420
theories this I know it's true

216
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,710
no no no

217
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:45,870
ramping from the audience to be a
ranting period gets worse

218
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:52,870
around the same time that each is doing
all this cleansing

219
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,130
he forms a company called sigh since

220
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:03,500
as anybody hear her size not a single
hand is going up which is

221
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,830
terrified of 1 a.m. no

222
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,510
it's a hand holding a camera no

223
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,010
no hand has gone sigh since

224
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:18,050
is the company that has provided the
database

225
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,270
that goes into Total Information
Awareness size and does the company that

226
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:22,880
form

227
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,930
the matrix database which will go into

228
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,430
sigh since is the

229
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,940
number one compiler the data that's
going

230
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,940
all the Patriot Act database you guys
have never heard of size

231
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,100
write down the name go to the Internet

232
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,130
look it up do your research you'll be
astounded you've never heard

233
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,280
I would

234
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:52,060
urge you to read it off the screen real

235
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,250
I'll

236
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,690
Seir sciences sorry bout

237
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:06,129
Aiken from here the

238
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,009
immediately after 9/11

239
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,109
size puts together a database called

240
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:15,069
HTF which stands for High terrorist

241
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:18,859
factor I know it sounds like something
Monty Python

242
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:23,699
but it's not it's something very very
frightening sigh since

243
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:28,059
meaning H claims that they took a
terrorist manual

244
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:31,919
use that manual to determine

245
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,970
terrorist behavioral characteristics

246
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:41,970
other than blowing things up this no
terrorist behavioral characteristic they

247
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:43,529
develop an algorithm

248
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:46,609
and a used algorithm to search

249
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:51,269
all love their billions of records and
they come up with the database

250
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:54,749
120 thousand Americans

251
00:16:54,749 --> 00:17:01,159
they turn this database over everybody
that they can every governmental agency

252
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,129
which at that point is terrified to miss

253
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:06,659
any lead they don't wanna claimed act on
a chip

254
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:10,639
every governmental agency runs that data

255
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:14,139
everybody in that database subjected

256
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:19,829
essentially to governmental proctology
exam not one single person

257
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,188
database is actually everest George
routers nevertheless

258
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,240
size and gets twelve million dollars
from

259
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,799
jeb Bush's brothers government to form a
database called matrix

260
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,460
which stands for multi state anti
terrorism

261
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,980
information exchange what this is is
they manage to get sixteen states to go

262
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,960
along with this

263
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,029
every driver's license every motor
vehicle every criminal record every

264
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:49,570
voter registration record

265
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,769
phone records banking records business
licenses gun licenses

266
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:59,970
small claims court filings you CC
filings corporate filings

267
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,620
I could stay there for about 20 minutes
list the stuff that the states required

268
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,549
to turn over

269
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:10,610
decisive a private company that you and
I have no right to look at their

270
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,480
activities

271
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,940
size and then take sixteen states with
confidential

272
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,500
merges with all the private database
stuff which I'm gonna show you in a

273
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,179
second

274
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,299
creates this matrix database this is big
brother

275
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:29,789
on steroids to the max you guys have
never heard

276
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,460
this never heard of size and as anyone
here ever heard a matrix

277
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,119
about 10 percent to the rooms raising

278
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,029
as which by the way is 9 percent more
than the average

279
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:44,029
audience that I speak stolen

280
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:49,669
matrix turns out to be such Obama's so
useless

281
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,169
that 9 the original sixteen states
pullout

282
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:58,029
Utah's Attorney General issues a press
release saying that it significantly

283
00:18:58,029 --> 00:18:59,379
flawed

284
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:03,149
and a danger to civil liberties my G
Utah

285
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:07,570
is the Mormons you cannot get more
conservative than Utah

286
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:14,570
Utah says matrix Sox the objection to
matrix is so huge

287
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:21,330
and the fallout is so enormous that
congress

288
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,649
thank god you're I still vote for the
phones

289
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:31,919
all of these data base efforts here's
where it gets really really scary boys

290
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,789
and girls

291
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,340
door which in general

292
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,860
or friend it started the Internet it
does a lot of

293
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:47,820
genuinely useful things dark one into
what's called

294
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,259
a black budget black budget means

295
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,419
is not reviewable it's basically a huge
chunk of money that shows up in their

296
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:59,379
budget next to it says

297
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:02,909
we're not telling you what we're doing
with this morn thank you very much

298
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,000
they took a huge chunk of this

299
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,250
twelve-point one million dollars

300
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,450
and used to find something called she
told

301
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,480
know it's called terrorist Information
Awareness

302
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,230
which is the most cynical obnoxious name

303
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,470
ever heard because the terrorist
information

304
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:29,570
awareness work was deformed

305
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:34,080
because they're a bunch polo shirts with
TIAA on them

306
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,389
wanna have to buy new Polo Shirts so
they kept the

307
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:40,389
initials

308
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:43,470
darpa turned around

309
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,639
and funded size fund a bunch of the
company's

310
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:51,179
there's a guy here is just taking off
his clothes

311
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,019
schism his

312
00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:02,019
I will say sir I hope you're in the
database

313
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,549
the scary thing is darpa which

314
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:09,289
years subject to at least some kind of
overview

315
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:13,529
some type of lawyer requests and
certainly

316
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:16,590
a look-see by the congress

317
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,039
has turned around and done nothing more

318
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,730
then funded private industry

319
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,700
private industry puts together these
data base

320
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,799
and then government axis is these
databases

321
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,879
on a per search bed for search space

322
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:38,740
so for example if what's your name since
I'm going to be using you as a victim

323
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,909
your first name so let's say I

324
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:47,760
Homeland Security which by the way their
privacy officer now

325
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,389
is a former double-click executive so

326
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:54,919
that's actually true that's honest to
god true

327
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,309
naira o'connor double-click executive

328
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:04,859
is now the Privacy Officer for the
Homeland Security Department

329
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:10,869
it boggles the mind let's say I want to
investigate

330
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:14,230
I'll really have the right necessarily
to look

331
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,139
up ends but bought

332
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:21,460
I go to sy syms

333
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,559
I login I go to a special

334
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,539
portal that they've set up for
governments

335
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:33,850
performing proctology on citizens I put
in whatever I know about Ben which is

336
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,919
typically

337
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,299
and and easily obtained by the way show
you because

338
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:41,859
then agrees to be a victim right on

339
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:45,500
a limited victim ok

340
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,129
it will take me about two seconds to get
Ben's date of birth Social Security

341
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:50,529
number Druce

342
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,279
I take that i plug it into the database

343
00:22:54,279 --> 00:23:01,000
and I get back everything now it's not

344
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,759
see that's what happens when you don't
use them arm

345
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:11,649
you know Wozniak was the lucky I could
get into my Mac

346
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:15,159
it's theirs i plug it in

347
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,909
I do an investigation completely outside

348
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:23,049
any warrant any court order the judge's
permission

349
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:27,820
I have not access governmental records
I've access private industry records

350
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,428
which Ben by the way cannot the ongoing
review because their private records

351
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:36,340
he would have to start a lawsuit again
size

352
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,699
and subpoena the records which by the
way sisal

353
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,869
with then say they can't turn over
because of the security restrictions

354
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:48,049
on their government contracts

355
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:51,490
can't get it through four can't get
through the government

356
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,600
cake action this is a loophole

357
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,590
large in of to drive a truck through

358
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,428
salutes discuss what exactly goes into
those database

359
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,720

or get into all market the beast
discussion but it's certainly

370
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,929

there or dozens of companies that
archive voter registration records

384
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,029

the most detailed information regarding
your personal politics and believes

00:25:54,849 --> 00:26:00,549
you know it's so easy to extrapolate to
who you are and what you believe

387
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:04,789
on the basis what you read where you
shop

00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,599
how on intended information pops

400
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:00,220

its nothing that you do

432
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:09,690
unless you have just the plane in 10
connected to a TV which

433
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,869
I would say maybe three percent of the
people in this room

434
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:16,990
everyone else's cable side TiVo

your medical condition and what
medicines you take

442
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:48,149
not just through something called the
might be the aptly named

443
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:51,450
might be medical information bureau
which

444

indexes all of your medical history for
the insurance industry

445
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:00,109

446
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:04,149
cell your prescription information

00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:18,329
for diapers and so on and so on to the
most privacy invading degree

450
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:22,450
what you eat whatchu where what you
drive

451
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,649

to RFID tags that are coming up scary
places

458
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:52,119
the government darpa is now in
developing something

459
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:55,950
and this was started by our body a
poindexter this is actually what it's

460
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,789
called

461
00:30:56,789 --> 00:31:00,570
human ID at a distance

462
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:04,200
this is already being used in five
cities what it is

463
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,529
its facial recognition technology but
it's also things like

464
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:11,679
heat recognition each person

523
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:12,119
what we know of that the site is who do
you want keeping control

524
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,600
this is a partial list

525
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,770
by the way since

526
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,480
darpa has your address I thought

527
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,520
I would put at the bottom of the screen
Total Information

528
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,359
awareness is headquarters address so if
you want a ride

529
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,380
go visit knock on the door asking for
your record

530
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,480
it is 3625 Fairfax Drive in Arlington

531
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,210
told Steve said

532
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,529
wanna talk to you about market

533
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:52,220
your big fear should not be Big Brother

534
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,710
it should be private industry it should
be

535
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,830
let's let's say little cousin as opposed
to Big Brother

536
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:03,160
for two reasons nobody

537
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,319
compiles more information than private
industry because it is worth

538
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:10,549
money to them

539
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:13,989
and every bit of this information

540
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:17,180
is now being made available to the
government because it's worth even more

541
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,989
money to them to sell it to the
government

542
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:28,989
this is a typical marketing and we're
gonna go from here

543
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,950
this is an ad for something called the
consumer passion index

544
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,160
every hobby every like every

545
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,410
dislike everything that somebody could
possibly sell you

546
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,549
is index do you have a dog do you have a
cat

547
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:47,640
horse do you like to play golf are you a
hunter

548
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,190
are you the

549
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,230
purchaser films

550
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,270
women in bikinis Russell

551
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,279
its starts from the earliest age

552
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:06,210
hear their advertising high school lists
and college lists

553
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:11,650
I want to tell you that lists are
compiled now on grade school kids

554
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,680
in return for companies making

555
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,080
free closed-circuit TV it's available
computers available including I'm sorry

556
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,470
to say

557
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,580
Apple does it's not

558
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,609
only when you become an adult when you
turn 18 when you start to fall

559
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:31,440
when you enter college when you apply
for credit these lists

560
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,259
start young six-years-old first-grade

561
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:40,799
California there was a big hole below
because people compiling lists

562
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:44,520
of preschool kids so they could market
to the kids

563
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,710
I believe Michael Jackson as this

564
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,130
our rights are the pointers

565
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,950
it starts even before your aides

566
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,569
here's a more intrusive use marketing is
our business

567
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,890
and here's some of the lists high school
students

568
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,379
college-bound high school students they
know what college you're going to

569
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,849
because the college's

570
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,599
sell your name data birth your social
security number

571
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:17,750
that's why when you go to college

572
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,630
pretty much the day you get your
acceptance you also get rid

573
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,960
for a visa card an app for a visa card

574
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,970
every college without exception no
collagen it states

575
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,859
that does not sell your information
monitor

576
00:38:35,859 --> 00:38:40,190

577
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:44,180
I mean I don't know what Anybody could
marketed to me when I was 15 but

578
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,930
apparently

579
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:49,839
teenagers are much more sophisticated
these days

580
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,239
your parents young professionals

581
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,730
