1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,299
making good progress on our second day
of the test help

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,870
like to i get a quick reminder

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,880
that we do have some session

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,720
Nazi things signed up so stay here for
this one

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,680
by go ahead and check the schedule over
across a hallway by the mat-su matter

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,560
area see

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,840
there's an interesting stuff coming up
pretty well through about midnight

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,400
tonight

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,500
and then we have thing signed up from 10
or 11 in the morning all the way through

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,650
to the end the conference

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:35,390
a lot of variety in that third track

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,400
I could if I had to memorize they
actually written them down but I

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,100
but I I would like to have aided are no
one is going on right now is

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,050
guy rebel talking about all-time phone
South at da

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,140
I rebel talking about phone stuff is
right now in C

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,400
don't know their stay here arm and into
into ours is some hacker checks

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,720
thing that I saw few posters for and
there is a session in between but

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,890
somehow the hacker checks one second my
mind

19
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,560
arm I hope not

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,700
I hope they're not doing a good I okay
anyway I

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,320
this site next talk is bypassing
corporate restrictions from the inside

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,280
by bar bar

23
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,280
welcome I

24
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,310
i order sows expecting like six people
and I think it

25
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,390
that now nine like I remember I am some
Buckingham employees and I'm

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,070
by yourself guys Axios

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,300
addis plan worked out that if those like
many people I could cause I'm back

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,410
times have someone speak like a real
audience

29
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,840
minority that either I'm

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,330
a very happy that %ah min the bear and
because little bit

31
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:02,330
less noisy and I cam but I'll probably
move size it

32
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,119
priced as it is I just like every other
been for most I've got a question just

33
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,440
shoutout and yeah I if I

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,090
now and I'll answer otherwise up down
here I didn't understand your accent or

35
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:17,580
something

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,110
and yet you speak in an Australian
accent

37
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:29,110
you're more likely being understood so

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,860
when we have been talking about is the
serve

39
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,470
restrictions have walking working on a
corporation and

40
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,410
I am tools and techniques that are
available to

41
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,859
get around them I just motivation

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,890
from a was I'm this is Danny thing
working in the IT industry way

43
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,010
you change jobs every outing months or
something

44
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,660
used to be because you got onto bigger
and better things

45
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,070
your money these days is cozy retrenched
HID every 18 months

46
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,620
am my theory was that if I keep working
for

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,180
Lodge Logic companies the likely to make
an retrench would

48
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,549
to grace and I am that the reason

49
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:18,350
actually holding any water but I am

50
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,370
I did find out a lot about larger and
larger companies and buy some with

51
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,519
currently has about

52
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,829
I think thousand people worldwide which
I'm

53
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:30,250
but Australia is a large company
probably America

54
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,959
its it's like stocks is I'm

55
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,620
but the lodge in the larger organization
you work for

56
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,840
the more policies and procedures have

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,270
have to i've come

58
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,290
in order to have the freedom that
Houston working

59
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,989
for joan is dead I'm

60
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,160
so sort of restrictions that I am

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,230
ike carroll et have

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,349
that I'm not used to and

63
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:05,930
and as such not had to put up with I
things like

64
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,090
service research inside I have potluck
inside can't get out

65
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,819
for things I message are

66
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,560
can't stream calling

67
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,550
work missing I'm

68
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,580
we've got way to a train

69
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,200
and I don't think I'll feel drained

70
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,380
or just some sort like spines that less

71
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,710
things through and things robot I'm

72
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,760
it's really like I i'm our kids develop
op Bhatt

73
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,969
I'm unable through

74
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,470
the filter is operated down i'd things
from like SourceForge

75
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,159
I am as because I have

76
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,700
one category which is downloads and
thats restricted side

77
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,330
in order for them to do put exceptions
for optical uses

78
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,430
is I'm a car made 22 in three forms and
get a science

79
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,510
I'm I guess finalize I'm

80
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,800
another thing I want to do is I wanted
access my machine from I'm

81
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,120
and I'm up on it personally really
insulting that

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,260
know me II another a much better way

83
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,409
that I really wanna do other than one
its jobs or

84
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:29,030
singer things outside work hours of
Honor appalling that

85
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,760
day current wise

86
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,240
up achieving this is sidelight why

87
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,750
that I don't have the option to use

88
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,080
my capabilities like broadband or
whatever I am

89
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,859
and/or its to what's essentially work

90
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,180
from I'm I am I I like to do it so

91
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,220
after standoffs 9 o'clock

92
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,710
the top five mice so

93
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,609
compass to talk about why is it getting
out of the network

94
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,690
I am so so things that you catch a

95
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,020
if you can successfully out your network
is

96
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,820
get away from the poorest regions

97
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,310
have things messenger

98
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,290
streaming because I I'm

99
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,509
and website blocking concept fucking

100
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:30,520
side essentially what you want is

101
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,590
to the aisle is for tiny which is an SMS

102
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,389
whichever am as an example

103
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:42,340
that II potential essentially wanna
create a direct connection

104
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,820
from I machine inside I'll like a
network to

105
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,919
machine outside on a particular poor

106
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,250
I'm about what we have

107
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,310
is a proxy server whether it's
transparent

108
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,789
or observations parent

109
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:05,159
AIPAC maybe I'm yeah opaque process

110
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,690
I'm it doesn't really matter that the
bottom line is that in order to get

111
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,729
out you have to go through I I machine

112
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:17,550
and at that point you can decide whether
it wants to allow you to

113
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,960
access that machine or that resource
that poor

114
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,259
and what size

115
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,479
so what you want to do is to have

116
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,699
all the connections going from I'm

117
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,470
going from your machine to and
acceptable

118
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,360
missing from your pot prices point of
view

119
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,600
I'm and a lot of situations you might
have web access

120
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,169
you might have caller ID available to be

121
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,539
I'm going out through and thats

122
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,969
that's it so what you made is

123
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,050
have some intermediary that will

124
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,110
accept a connection from your internet
work

125
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:12,110
and then route that connection to where
you actually want to go

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,510
so what you want to do is

127
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,180
adding routing information basically to
your

128
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,650
your connections so if you can

129
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,650
think about it an abstract way

130
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,710
your before you

131
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,039
send are a crest to the Internet which
goes through the proxy server

132
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,090
you want to add a liar

133
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:46,130
on it sign I am state your address with
side

134
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,620
guy going from that pays a photog on
port ID me when I lie about that

135
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,910
site %ah I wanna make a connection dying

136
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,240
to proxy to on port 80 so when

137
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,770
that tries to see out into the internet

138
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,350
goes through a proxy server all it nyse:

139
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,660
is I'm and it's a guy through

140
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,810
to put it: on

141
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,990
party to and I don't know anything good
or bad about forty-two

142
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,600
sigh I'm gonna let that happen actually
I'm

143
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,280
I think initially when we had

144
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,520
the webb says putting by had

145
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,150
night vision for minimizing servers

146
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,500
sigh

147
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,980
ever on which is Catherine an online
service but

148
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,260
by saying at the inside I'm

149
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,900
basically if it's just that it's if the
machine that is on nine

150
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,579
by whatever your locking suffer is

151
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,480
then guy waving like a maniac

152
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,590
back yes Nevins the game

153
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,710
I'm

154
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,480
by the federal government yes so

155
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,060
what your so as long as that

156
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,350
proxy to Shane is now on a blacklist all
on

157
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,430
I am some serve list

158
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,900
that will make a unacceptable 247 have
no problem

159
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:21,350
routing connection by then in order to
extract the original request

160
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,530
from that you made some sort of service
that will

161
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,910
cap out that information and

162
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,010
nyse: where to then follow that request
on

163
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,660
I'm the raisin

164
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,550
yet there is ice II plays my spices

165
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,110
will allow you to have web access so

166
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,380
what can you do with looking do this

167
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,460
on and if you look at have time today
which is

168
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,750
and say version beat I'll

169
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,790
there's a client and a server-side

170
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,469
as you can say you made by

171
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,650
I'm a rapper

172
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,650
and ira poll for a and

173
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:18,650
the you can look at it from pocket so
there is a little weird because

174
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,350
and probably all running as service by

175
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,380
from the I to make in their quest

176
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,140
on initial pace a it word

177
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,949
be calling a client I'm just

178
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,230
so if you if you look at

179
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,480
from the into networks point of view

180
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,100
UK and use other talents 8c

181
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,410
create a I'll

182
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:00,310
is their I can explain it better

183
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,770
what your what you know wanting to do is
to creates

184
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,870
a tunnel between or

185
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,010
to have time to as as a software

186
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,420
Irish situation

187
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,550
so in order to have something that will
add

188
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,589
head is top and remove has

189
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:27,690
and it's gonna be one solution econ have

190
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,339
I'm something at one side that that
doesn't understand like

191
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,460
if i if i add con my my routing
information

192
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:42,020
to I ICP request without something that
will

193
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,310
pull it out it's not gonna work the
things that I don't have control of

194
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,860
I the proxy server and the client
application

195
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,430
like as a messenger so when I'm
interacting with MSN Messenger

196
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,110
likens the best I can do is this I I'm

197
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,200
I needs access your

198
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,270
serve our via a proxy server

199
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,210
now if I specified

200
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,580
as the proxy server my real proxy server

201
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,190
it's going to get setup proxy server and
then

202
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,580
ask that for the I meant I get my Shane

203
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,279
which is scary disallowed and

204
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,880
if I don't have the capability which I
don't have the capability to

205
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,740
tell MSN Messenger I want to connect to

206
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,230
the server proxy to then I need
something

207
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,279
to take that request

208
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,050
change it to a form that will

209
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,220
at this writing information so it can

210
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,850
I'm coming down so bicycle we have the
client application

211
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,580
calling a service

212
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,220
to at the routing information that will
then

213
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,170
make a request to unknown proxy to serve
and I'll go through

214
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:10,209
that proxy server which when it receives
a request ill

215
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:16,400
unwrap that and send it to the track
time a shame SIPRI say

216
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,089
I am the messenger client

217
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,010
it connects to I'm

218
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,689
it connects I HTTP proxy to the local
host

219
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,959
so an offer to do that you made some
service running

220
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,070
on the local house and that's where the
timing

221
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,270
clients of it comes in

222
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,069
if you said you said up the clients of a
tu sei

223
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,220
I wanna be I'm running on

224
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,980
particular poor this situations put it:

225
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,280
I want to

226
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,860
route to a particular

227
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,570
Shane particular port and I wanna go
through a particular proxy

228
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,570
sci fi say the month pay proxy is saying

229
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,010
I want to send I wanna to use this
particular proxy

230
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,540
and the F is public folders is on a Ford
requests from point A Thousand

231
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,270
to proxy to on port I so

232
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,650
from the proxies point of view it
receives

233
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,959
request to proceed to

234
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,209
on port 80 and it I was not a problem

235
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:34,650
trust us either so on the server side

236
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,050
you need something to hear is save that
requests on port ID

237
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,450
I'm ProCite and then no

238
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,900
waited for that on C so there is

239
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,970
the companion to

240
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,060
tunneling software which is online
service software

241
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,130
which basically forwards

242
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,550
any request optical port to another miss
a No

243
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,920
other on upon a missing say

244
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,310
I'm USA if the server is set to forward

245
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,560
to stock missing

246
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,430
part id: anything that comes in on port
80 it will

247
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,790
blindly just I'm Senate traffic through
so

248
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,380
I guess the there's just some

249
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,480
things that look for by I'm

250
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,449
I miss my slide what

251
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,230
the what that I'm distinctly tells you
is

252
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,459
well as I if I want to Ron

253
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,239
another service I wanted as well as
messenger I want to

254
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:52,249
I am is cuz I'll

255
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:56,149
hypothetically then I'm

256
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,509
I obviously need that to be running on a
different port

257
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:04,809
because all for all requests on port
idea going to get routed to the

258
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:05,629
messenger server

259
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,370
and that's true

260
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,519
to the extent that I'm

261
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:17,089
to wait it's configured it's just going
to blindly

262
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,510
send all the connections through but

263
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,010
if you're running up a real proxy server
so it got their proxy now

264
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,460
and having all your requests for it to

265
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,460
a proxy server then that will

266
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,840
be able to deliver any other requests to
the correct location

267
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,840
all coming from the same paw day

268
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,070
the client the client application aware
of proxy to

269
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,790
the client application as in MSN
Messenger

270
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:02,030
right is on away like you to come you
can modify that

271
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,250
it doesn't even know nights is

272
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,760
it has no knowledge of what it is that
you look here the client application

273
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,790
is thinks that the the real proxy server
is going it

274
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,909
inaez is going to they

275
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,270
Tiger Shane apart and I D and it thinks
is going

276
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,600
there fire approaches about which is on
the local highest

277
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,360
at port 8,000

278
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,610
for eight thousand which is where the
timing client software is sitting

279
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,150
so the PC that that has the client
software on it

280
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,370
that's capturing the

281
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,780
the client software is packets

282
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,780
and wrapping that and then sending that
the proxy to

283
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,320
yes okay it is in effect it is

284
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,240
actual HTTP proxy so what what that
would actually do it just for save

285
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,960
request

286
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,430
go through its stable love tilting rose
and then

287
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,130
for that on and what this is doing is

288
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,710
its rating request assign I'm going to
actually

289
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,090
put this request into I'm

290
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,290
mine has a something that i'm gonna add
my I N

291
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:19,170
ratting 20 which is sign I'm going to go
to proxy to

292
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,160
by this proxy and expected its gonna get
unwrapped track lay

293
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I like

294
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,910
have you ever maybe thought about are
setting up SSH on port 80

295
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,420
I'm outside machine and 40 report how

296
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,070
yeah messenger a sound like an American
accent

297
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,760
that I'll get SSI say a

298
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:55,760
back yeah

299
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,690
question terraces write a captive portal
environments where everything is routed

300
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,470
to do it so I can use bigger its lower

301
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,960
sure how does this apply to captive
portal environments

302
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,010
to your requirements captive portal
environments where there's no direct

303
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,658
route out to the net do you have any
advice for

304
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:20,280
feeding restrictions on as I captive
portal

305
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,350
yeah I think that's an americanism on
for various

306
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,370
captive portal being commercial cyber
cafes in locations where

307
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,440
my CV axle methodology shipping is

308
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,789
I got resources see the

309
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:38,950
application for channeling in that
environment they

310
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,490
the difficulty with that is this
requires used to

311
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:47,750
have suffering stalled and so you really
need control over

312
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,210
I'm a number miss janes in order to

313
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm rappin on rap the routing
information

314
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,399
sigh it's not it's not

315
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,130
what you carry it saved this

316
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,010
when you have to go through I am

317
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,129
when you when you're a lockdown machine
is the same as a lot of environment have

318
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:10,510
their

319
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,610
their machines really locked down so I
you can even stores offer on them

320
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,700
and in this situation if you're a final
an environment that you have any machine

321
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,530
on the network that you can store stuff
on

322
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,620
you can run the client or the server on

323
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,770
a different machine as long as its I'm

324
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,770
within the network before it gets the
proxy server

325
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,870
its kind to successfully go through
their

326
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:37,059
but environment where you have no
control over any of the machines

327
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,080
in that internet lack israeli

328
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,970
I'm alarm more limitations upon you that
will restrict your ability to get out

329
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:52,140
through while that I watched holy crap

330
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,299
I'm

331
00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:02,299
this point somebody

332
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,630
correct can change the proxy server

333
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,170
hedges nanananana

334
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,850
nada it you have to have a pretty locked
down a shame if you can't change

335
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:25,850
I to the proxy of MSN Messenger yeah but
say I think the Active Directory

336
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,360
and in Australia yeah

337
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,370
yet there

338
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,750
side you you definitely

339
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,800
would made I am some insane

340
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,610
in that network that you have the
ability to and so something out have

341
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,360
something right now

342
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,580
I we've got tech support down here

343
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,970
do you have any other questions I'm

344
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,690
yet side the fact is if you're running I

345
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,470
web proxy on this proxy machine then

346
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,400
yet now have I am capability to

347
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,440
might any I City request to

348
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,970
any location that is I'm

349
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,450
not necessarily authorized because from
your web proxies

350
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,810
from your enterprises want to do or you
ever doing is going through that proxy

351
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:30,629
to me saying

352
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:35,050
I'm other things that you

353
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,860
and a rich I time now

354
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,790
have there pat down is I'm you can

355
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,530
rap your HTTP request

356
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:51,620
in an SL ass i I'm

357
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,820
this things which I I really haven't
looked into Damascus other things

358
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,340
I am give security which with a random
it by

359
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:02,010
i think is like estado its is basically
as

360
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:05,660
rap you can put at a higher level on
past

361
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,920
pay I'm telling to

362
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,860
hide the actual request the ascending

363
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,810
the other thing that I guess is kinda

364
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,010
being made pretty clear is that you need
to have

365
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:25,650
control of I am or

366
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,690
modifiable capabilities of I'm ashamed
by

367
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,840
in the internet work and on the Internet
so

368
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,520
a lot people sigh all happens if I there
is I like that it has their own

369
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,760
serve on the internet that I can stores
offer on that's gonna be

370
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,810
apparently connected I am

371
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,980
their %ah services you can use

372
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,130
that I'm willing to port forwarding by

373
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,610
I promise I that's not

374
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,690
the nineteen nineties anymore these are
as much as the left side is then

375
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,050
the noughties and I'm if you don't have
broadband

376
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:11,740
their thing we go abroad in Australia
said you have in America

377
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,950
then yes I'm

378
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,780
yes it's something I mean fidel thing
you can do some on my mice

379
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,810
my solution is to either use the service
their broadband

380
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,929
Mike a friend I'm because

381
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,690
your if you have this practice a rock

382
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,740
other people can still news that

383
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,020
to I am have to route their information

384
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,450
so actually I think has the best
solution make a friend I'm dick lickers

385
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:46,110
if you see if I check with broadband and
after jumped on fire

386
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:53,110
I am

387
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,119
site yet up upset by the

388
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,799
services saying up to now style party

389
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,899

00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:18,789
the the options that were given to me
from I'm

394
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:22,619
my organization was to either dalian I

397
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:33,309

399
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,359
up allies

400
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:44,989
or I had baby incline and

401
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:48,919
I don't know if it's just us or

402
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,389
if it's pretty nervous about my these
problems with VPN clients why I

403
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:57,039
I'm yet to run Windows which wasn't

404
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,590
a terrible like this makers I'm it does
have a mission around windows

405
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,059
I just like to make a complaint about it
I'm

406
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:08,428
and also its aims to hijack my

407
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:12,289
interconnection sigh I don't know if
that is intrinsic I love

408
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:15,309
Cisco VPN or whatever bad I'm

409
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,539
everything was then going through

410
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:22,429
that bpm Inc any any

411
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:28,369
internet connection with Santa and
thanks I even things like

412
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:31,409
a good thing about living stratos

413
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:34,960
I'm we have to hack out if I was to get
into work

414
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,859
sigh might if I uses the Internet Dennis

415
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:43,570
TV Guide ida and I can get that through
the VPN link

416
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,389
that was enough for mister him

417
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:54,389
sorry just one point out the reason why
a culture

418
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:58,909
your ability to connect outside the
network is cuz if it didn't

419
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:02,099
then there's potential that your box
could become a router

420
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:05,080
yeah be able to route from the public
Internet in your corporate network

421
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,928
without

422
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:12,929
any any controls on still find a house

423
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:25,660
I think if this interview with taxable
guys their

424
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,150
I mean like it I'ma make sense and I'm a
big right by

425
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,760
is this very situations where it's not
going to be the right thing

426
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,310
what I think for me just one I'm

427
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,879
so what I wanted to do was to devise
establish a direct action from

428
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,320
I'm pace a to I machine

429
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,960
within now internetwork I'm

430
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,070
unfortunately we have is can say

431
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:01,050
does that look like bricks

432
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:07,330
I'm I made so much effort to make it
look like a actual I call it in every

433
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,270
every brick so what

434
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,150
the file laws restricting us to is I'm
access

435
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:18,290
out but no I'm

436
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,600
I'm this kinda rubbish because I mean

437
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,490
its nyse: name every life

438
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,960
its as conceptual rather than reality
before

439
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,860
text guys jump inside good I'm

440
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,680
so as to what I want to do is kinda
establish a uni-directional link

441
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,850
because I and II but I can go after the
firewall if

442
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,540
I can Cape that link I pen and then use
that as your direction a link then

443
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,420
I shouldn't be action have problem I'm

444
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:52,120
either talking from one to the other the
other one and that's when

445
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,360
it wonderful sites as

446
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,360
ago does everything you on that if you

447
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,629
again if you have poorer sections my
wanna run a site on a different Paul

448
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,070
but so for example of harrowing

449
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,330
here on my compensation alright message

450
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,080
i'm for a thousand because thats

451
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,179
acceptable pour through I'll power

452
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,180
so the

453
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:32,180
sighing that I want to from

454
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,940
to often share from the tiger same the
target machine

455
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,730
inside the network obviously because
that the Anne place they can

456
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,450
break through the follow-on make a
connection so yes they're on

457
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,110
SSH server on what is

458
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,430
actually the request him a shame from
your point of view

459
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,650
by from exercised

460
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,960
20th around so if you

461
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,460
run sites as a server

462
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,470
on your home a shame

463
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,820
and then when your work you Ron

464
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,149
SSH client to connect to that server

465
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,700
you can say that I also want to

466
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,600
stott redirecting parts so

467
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,650
what you have here is the

468
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,720
must pay a thousand says I want to
connect

469
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,500
point thousand document changes actually

470
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,310
the last bit which is they say minus

471
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,530
iris says I wanna set up a remote

472
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:40,300
greater are my or forwarding says

473
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,040
that on the book 59

474
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,389
100 I am

475
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,510
our on a redirect or 5900

476
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:58,360
on the target machine to like a hotspot
X 900 sigh

477
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,490
I'm could be clarified and

478
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,880
points per really so

479
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,920
after executing that command

480
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:15,260
you have made II show connection to your
pace a

481
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,560
and also

482
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,720
have listening

483
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,130
poor 5900 on your Tiger missing your

484
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:31,360
worker saying is this thing on port 5900
but whenever I make a connection to it

485
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,510
what as a site or do will

486
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,110
send that all that request or whatever

487
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,810
whatever connection dieter is send that
through as a site's back to your place a

488
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:46,620
make a connection to what have you
outlined their which is

489
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,710
like a host 100 I get I've been a
connection to like i sed 900 and then

490
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,150
followed all that tighter on

491
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,150
sign in fact you could have

492
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,000
I am a second Miss Jane

493
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,910
at home and

494
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:07,470
have SSH connection coming through

495
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,530
to the local host time saying going to a
different machine

496
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,260
I'm from your pace a

497
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,020
say

498
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,300
as long along with right phoning you can
do

499
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,370
local forwarding which means yes it's
the opposite so

500
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:32,000
any request so that would sell SSH
server to open up

501
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,200
I a service

502
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,590
on a particular port and any request you
get from there

503
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,810
will get forwarded back through this

504
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,980
faced I don't the climb

505
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,680
side just this is the opposite of them I
following

506
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,000
and you can sigh I want follow this
through a proxy

507
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
so them

508
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,500
so that basically gives you the
capability today

509
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,929
then have any service

510
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:14,960
have running on other Shane think that
it's running locally

511
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,580
but in fact it's running on another
machine at the other end of the tunnel

512
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,848
so if I want to

513
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:27,220
run bien se

514
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,109
into my machine at work with this setup

515
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:35,710
I am on my pace a which is running the
server

516
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,030
i connect like a house 5900

517
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,419
and it thinks that

518
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:47,629
from fans is funded think that it's just
acts like a shame but that will go

519
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:48,159
through

520
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,000
and actually pullout holiday to they
gets returned from

521
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,710
a connection be made to poor 900

522
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,359
on but I commissioning which is mission

523
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,590
works i effect I get is my to stop work

524
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:07,810
which fix people that witnessed of
thanks to my desk I'm

525
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,839
so what to do

526
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:15,660
combining these technologies I'm there
is the ultimate solution

527
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,920
they it so it's always gonna be
dependent on

528
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,740
goes maynes level paranoia

529
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,500
if you don't have access to

530
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,589
dedicated are saying II noise on a shame
on the internet thing

531
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:35,080
have difficulty

532
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,960
doing any this that's not provided by
some third-party service

533
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:46,920
if you think that the sysadmin Zarate in
all the IP packets coming from

534
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,430
you're saying work which is quite
possible

535
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,940
then you name I wanna rubber thing up
and SSL

536
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,560
and you can like that you can combine
all these technologies so you can run

537
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,609
as a site's I'm through

538
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:05,779
a I sip a tunnel through

539
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,560
anchor with SSL by because every liar
the ad is

540
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,279
had to resources and overheads and

541
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,599
unit find a balance betraying yes

542
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:20,750
your requirements and your situation

543
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,810
and scares me

544
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:31,230
when a finisher that is like to come
back in hi I believe the known as like

545
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,650
or

546
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,410
not as does the event and I know it is
said routing

547
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:43,410
may business right there then sometimes
indecisive

548
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,960
rethink coming am

549
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,450
so as an example out I'll talk about the
situation that

550
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:58,940
I would have by if my company if I

551
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,010
if they knew that well 99

552
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,440
if well yes hypothetical situation

553
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,640
if there is a company that had maybe a
thousand people and

554
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,710
was a programmer who work for them yeah

555
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,300
it's a little different akers the works
well as the other way

556
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:23,650
size mine to be applicable to you
Pattaya

557
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:30,650
I'm we we have I got the other the %uh
thing it does because our program a

558
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:31,830
quite often

559
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,348
I've make solutions rather find
solutions so

560
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:40,410
I'm be politicized asiana reinvent the
wheel

561
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,770
they they obviously don't know how good
will to get

562
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:47,170
am

563
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:53,300
so rehab their section of I mean I would
say go out to report ID and my my

564
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,190
problem is that

565
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,720
arm on machines hi I'm

566
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,890
I'm have few different things that I
wanna have accessed

567
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,609
and icons

568
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:09,759
because I got axis 214 182

569
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,380
I need to have some why I love then
selecting

570
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,910
what I once I I'm I've gotta written

571
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,490
hey poor redirected your

572
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,869
come ok accept connections in on port I
D

573
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:30,540
and then rating the first line from a
client or decide what to do with it

574
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,720
so you can

575
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,980
effects it out I said like page severe

576
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,710
separatism like a because I've got like
my to ask website and

577
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,640
like I've got a couple other way so is
that yeah I can rate high citizens Irish

578
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,950
service and then off to

579
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,500
things sometime things I like this

580
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,570
you need to modify because the Klein
doesn't say anything

581
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:58,850
nationally saying I want and what size

582
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:03,589
I'm the fact that everything

583
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:07,980
has to go out to report it. I am kind it
wasn't a problem because I had the

584
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,770
capability to

585
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,920
identified that this request is

586
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,100
a Weber crest or not to be repressed or
whatever request

587
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,950
and registered whatever

588
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,339
local services running aren't

589
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:29,410
so it onto satisfy my goals which was

590
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,200
I'm bypass Websense blocking

591
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,030
and to bypass

592
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,430
for torturing and ambiance a

593
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:44,259
to my computer from I'm all I've done

594
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,960
is added esta sites

595
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,660
to my car my machine at work to connect
him I like him saying

596
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,330
appointee which gets redirect

597
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,710
a different part internally I'm

598
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,119
with some forwarding 2/2i following

599
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,560
I can come back poets

600
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,830
the things that I i've and

601
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,710
with SSI its well one other one other

602
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,280
the problems I have is that I wanna be I
would say from

603
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,460
either side rewritten or saying and have
it come back

604
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,480
automatically paddling come back
automatically

605
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,560
and if I have credit an SSH connection
from my work computer to my home

606
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,040
computer

607
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,460
and I rebuilt my home computer that

608
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,400
SSH connection doesn't realize it no
longer available

609
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,600
until you try incense and I through

610
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,140
so I am I have

611
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,490
because I have that falling I

612
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:53,930
then have another one about a program
that just tries to access

613
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,069
like a house for whatever which is
actually going through the tunnel

614
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:02,390
and the minute it decides that

615
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:05,980
the company through to realize that that
ours is

616
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,930
no longer available animal close
application

617
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:13,220
so I've got like a few changes jobs that
will

618
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:19,030
tryin reestablish this if it doesn't
exist and

619
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,690
it will yeah really care about nothin
bout but

620
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,260
isolated can allow you

621
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,089
reboot either Shane and have that

622
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,089
catching coming back up through

623
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:39,049
wonders logging

624
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,100
I'm so i think thats in something

625
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,350
as well

626
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:49,180
finally responsibilities so

627
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,190
some people say that if you're I now i
picking up

628
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,650
another why are people injuring in your
copper network it's a bad thing

629
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,550
and I'm I think should take it as a
challenge since I am that

630
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:04,520
I understand that I'm comprising
security

631
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,270
organization about I feel personally the

632
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,910
like mother all whatever

633
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:15,410
public computer have his covers security
then

634
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,170
the the pics & around as the

635
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,930
this guy's spent three thousand dollars
on and

636
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,379
that can be a truth fact that I've
decide to

637
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,570
change the admin password so I i mean i
i think that

638
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:33,610
to say anything you have the
responsibility ops up

639
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:37,820
realizing that you're potentially
compromising

640
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,880
your copper network because

641
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,530
a summer house access to my shame than
they can

642
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,690
coming through that copper network and

643
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,020
that's probably worthwhile

644
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,230
deciding whether you can handle that
responsibility

645
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,460
on our well I guess I

646
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:03,080
if you if you conscious of it then

647
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,900
you probably all be conscious of

648
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,770
things and securities I'm

649
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,850
take an average because I have all them

650
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,069
connections coming to report idea I'm

651
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:22,950
have some interesting requests coming

652
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,450
this is Ruth I watched the trends love
I'm

653
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:31,260
my attack scripts as they serve filter
the country

654
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,300
because I'm on like while my Giants pay

655
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,910
networks and and I think it was just got
through their

656
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,529
ranges and I've got some

657
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:46,510
certain things that well if people are
requesting

658
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,630
same data X a slash sleaze last la

659
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,220
then well I back it back in the early
days

660
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:58,220
hours was less mature I'm I toss them

661
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,940
that's I am its

662
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,000
its assistance thing to to say nowadays
what they do is they

663
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,270
like like 4,000

664
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,740
now characters something and i think
thats kennedy's yeah

665
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,780
side if you're if you are a known as the
same with

666
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,350
I

667
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,460
in into I S and

668
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:27,720
you don't get a win is a tiger says
you're like 20

669
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,960
politics things that allied thing coming
right eleanor stuff

670
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,650
then you probably shouldn't be
additionally I have no connection to the

671
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:37,520
copper network

672
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,430
and that's

673
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,460
I think much or so

674
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,620
got some

675
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,950
as anyone who was too scared to jump in
the middle there's a

676
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:02,950
say a guy

677
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:13,040
speak with us right same questions wanna
come up cue up for something

678
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:18,610
on as frankly if i forgot

679
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:24,020
was over here about the captive portal

680
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,770
the captain Paul captive portal captive

681
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:31,759
yeah Michael a suitable

682
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,070
do are like Nokia was actually does his
own

683
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:40,840
place like a Starbucks is a what happens
when you try to go to any website

684
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,560
first like a redirect you to their pager
whether

685
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,830
soul you can log in or sign

686
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:53,470
service so really just still be able to
work through

687
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:56,640
like in WiFi networks bring your laptops

688
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,700
are you you talk about hot but you're
talking about

689
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,540
generals your kiss kiss lick hot spots
use this technology

690
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:10,540
these %ah hotspot yep

691
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:18,529
I A if you bring a lot up inches over
the hotspot

692
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:23,810
the cap 24 hours like doxie at all for
your system with you can like

693
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:27,740
what happens once you login you have a
valid session new tropical seem like

694
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,200
normal

695
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,220
yeah so that you can use regular proxy

696
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,560
seems yet

697
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,560
yeah

698
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,770
up by blocking him

699
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:51,920
and also on the bpm

700
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,599
it's not that actually they actually
just like stop your session

701
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:02,579
to any site before you log in and then
once you login you have a valid

702
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,890
all pipe its or like hong so lucky

703
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:09,049
or not on it or 2.1 X I'll

704
00:47:09,049 --> 00:47:12,819
were once you have that ballot session
they let everything go through like

705
00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:17,630
yes although although the app

706
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,200
active portals don't you don't based
solely on that they also have on the pop

707
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,520
window and weird things happen if you
actually like abilities if you don't you

708
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,849
watch is where things like doping each
other

709
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:34,750
just two other weird stuff school its
and also the VPN

710
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,030
sinking if you really want to get its
you could

711
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,700
still goes go with a different
connections with the VPN we could

712
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:43,579
probably do is

713
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:48,049
two network cards to figure out bank's
routing so that's own

714
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:52,380
click click for the for the table maybe
if you knew all

715
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,930
if it was went to the same DNS name or
IP address

716
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,410
for the the TV guys if you consider to
row

717
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,509
I don't know if that's what you're
talking about with the PPI was a

718
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,619
was for the table well

719
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,630
doesn't matter but like a

720
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:13,349
but all that because because with idea
so

721
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:19,170
either I have a very different weather
out about like it cysts

722
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,700
taking any time establishing connection
seems

723
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,130
hijacking hoax you know what let's base
cuz to that user will be plans for small

724
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:32,170
tropical sea anti-terror down for you
could configure advanced routing so the

725
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,250
only certain track not sir traffic but

726
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:38,490
traffic to send us the nation goes to
the beach but

727
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:42,540
if if when you so much bpm on when does
a black

728
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,380
prop shell and so route print rail

729
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,380
will show you round table no you know
you could set up

730
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:57,380
advance tables on where to go thanks at
something for everyone

731
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,569
I don't know what everyone else is
around sailor for for 440 but I use ssh

732
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:07,799
this capital T for

733
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:14,140
for dynamic sucks for proxy else is that
to set up a dynamic socks for proxy

734
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,440
from your on the loopback interface
versus network

735
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,690
and they go to your remote system if it
supports SSH

736
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:24,720
and party supports that so that's what I
is for adult courts

737
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,869
capital T

738
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:35,869
for everyone

739
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,669
do normal way to to multiple ports

740
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,190
up for you can you can put as many as
you want so you can cite

741
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:48,880
mine is def by myself by myself was
Obama's

742
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,249

was no problem one one

744
00:49:55,269 --> 00:49:59,459
1pc so firewall people court sorry

745
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:03,209
I'll bill goes going to include actually

746
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:06,900
being that SSH if you did

747
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,949
your your web traffic 40 traffic through

748
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:13,499
SSL to the administrators your company

749
00:50:13,499 --> 00:50:17,729
look a lot less suspicious encrypt the
data run

750
00:50:17,729 --> 00:50:22,049
for supposed 40 there and and the thing
is like

751
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:25,479
when I say Sunday like you

752
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:28,959
going to this one missing all the time

753
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:32,670
thing I think this grip on the machine

754
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:39,670
me light it tell the other thing you
want to do is to establish a

755
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:40,819
relationship with her

756
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:45,239
the network guys side that but I'm but
I'm located see

757
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:48,839
by carefully will help disguise down
from here

758
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:55,839
we produce wheelabrator one more
question just

759
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,780
have you ever gotten caught doing this
got in trouble for

760
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,810
so you to establish a relationship the
network guys

761
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:09,750
like a side like

762
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:14,200
I am I haven't but

763
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,170
establish a relation its its

764
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:22,990
is purely a matter of gauging the
culture of the place

765
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:26,920
and I'm yeah I if you think that they're
gonna kick your ass

766
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,060
than you identify whether that risk is
worth

767
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:35,220
de Linea por side Kors

768
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,650
like that so instance for as americans
