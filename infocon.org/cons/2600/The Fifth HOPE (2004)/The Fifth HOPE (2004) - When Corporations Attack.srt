53
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,419
sorry I actually is important that you
you watchin

54
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,500
look at these things the heir to the
satellite watch news when I bought it

55
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,430
personal I did purchase as I bought it
from gentleman in Virginia

56
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,970
because I is because I'm subscriber and

57
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,330
the person that was publishing it was
getting tired of grading

58
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,550
he published it during the days of CBN
does anyone here know it c-band

59
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,539
satellite is

60
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:28,719
re: CBN is the big ugly day should be
busy people's yards nowadays I V

61
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,150
if you see me but his yard usually point
towards the ground because they have a

62
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,969
small many dish cable from the sky

63
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,180
it was always our policy

64
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,860
and believes that if you put something
in space you pay to put a satellite in

65
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,669
space

66
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,710
put their programming on you attribute
that your program you're entitled a

67
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,300
revenue

68
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,330
that should not be stolen

69
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,479
were hacked are taking however

70
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,919
the position the satellite watch news
was to report

71
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,180
both sides of the industry even the
compromises

72
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,909
and what people did not yute year who
are transmitting

73
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,930
those pay-tv signals and we did that we

74
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:15,860
we did very well we found by doing that

75
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,229
in doing a good job for many years

76
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,000
that a that the original people who
started creeping satellite signals

77
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,289
general instruments HBO was the big I

78
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:31,370
started the whole thing home box office

79
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,320
on C band would eventually be hacked

80
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,430
you know be some years later it would be
done when

81
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:46,209
the broad outer implemented the whole
video say pretty scrambler the beginning

82
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,279
nothing was scrambled

83
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,310
p the program respond Audi it was

84
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,260
your programs eventually found out that
people were stealing their signals

85
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,560
because it was free air

86
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,270
and they decide to do something about it
so the contractor general insurance

87
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,650
general smith made a box

88
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,449
and they started selling it everybody
starting crap the analog video digital

89
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,160
audio

90
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,500
that went along for a number years

91
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,730
this magazine started writing about it
back with the previous

92
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,090
publisher handed general instruments
never bothered

93
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:20,480
the previous publisher one little bit
during that time prior to buying this

94
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,250
thing I was doing a satellite radio talk
show about satellite technology

95
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,010
the chief security offer officer for
general instruments called me one day

96
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,380
city like to be on my radio programs

97
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,930
his neighbor Jim Shelton Jim come on the
show he said

98
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,470
how much he enjoyed this publication

99
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,530
the sadly watch news now mind you he's
the cheap

100
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,819
security officer for general instruments

101
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,030
and I said GM why do you enjoyed

102
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,600
he said number one you tell us where
we're lacking we should know that but we

103
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,240
don't

104
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,110
he said number two you give us a source

105
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,340
but the people selling it and I said

106
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,370
didn't why hasn't there been many

107
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,610
raids at all it was a few rates big big
know people

108
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,210
very few rates though in this country at
the time is it because

109
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,260
overtime we like to see implemented in
people's homes

110
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,790
and eventually we like we take great
pride pride and pleasure in

111
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,040
actually shutting it off because we find
out the cloud key

112
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,420
so they had this cloud here that was was

113
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,490
some was billing at a price taking the e
prom with the instructions at

114
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,940
taking a known working subscribe be
scrambler including several

115
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,630
units to the match met her excuse me the
master key scrambler

116
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,420
all this went on and on and on for years
but general instruments never did

117
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,400
attacked the magazine then I been
running it for a couple years in 1997 I

118
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,630
was running a problem for about four
years then

119
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,310
I was Reese I received a
cease-and-desist order from

120
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,910
DirecTV is it a

121
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,219
we would like you to drop all other all
the advertising in your magazine

122
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,220
on or magazine could be supported on
subscription base alone

123
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,569
you need your advertisers knowing

124
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:19,060
that we at satellite watch news

125
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,769
had never bend directly involved any
type of compromise

126
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,630
felt that in no way we were in jeopardy
or violating any law

127
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,790
we ignore the cease and desist order

128
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,870
several months went by

129
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,810
I would II wanna say probably about

130
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,000
four months John walk to my office when
they never seen before I live in a small

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,089
community it's kinda like podunk nowhere

132
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,199
you know everybody this guy walks in he
says

133
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,019
you dan Morgan I said yes race as get
healthier he says I got a Christmas

134
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,079
present for you pal

135
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,630
slaps down a 23-page summons and
complaint

136
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,529
course the first big boy lying you are
being sued

137
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:03,350
and goes on to you are

138
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:09,769
had me sign paper and out the door ago
so I said I read this Abril disbelief

139
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:16,009
real real disbelief the following night
was Wednesday night and I

140
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,600
did my radio show from nine to midnight

141
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,550
and talked about what happened that day

142
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,970
at first I guess I was really

143
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,040
pissed off upset mad angry

144
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,790
but then talking about on the radio show
and explain it to people

145
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,259
it's amazing

146
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,000
who really listens to what you trying to
tell people they do telling the truth

147
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,699
the next morning I get a call from two
attorneys that were subscribers

148
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:55,759
and so we started discussing you know he
wanted to see the summons and complaint

149
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,689
wanna be a fax and copy is

150
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,740
a course you want to qualify anybody
that

151
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,560
may represent you in federal court

152
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,809
an idea that in the next day I faxed him
the summons and complaint

153
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:13,819
we got under way there you know our
whole program underway we started

154
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:14,939
building a defense

155
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:19,149
ultimately

156
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:23,629
to make a long story really short

157
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:26,939
the attorney I had

158
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:33,209
I feel was brought by direct television

159
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:38,329
and I'll tell you why three days

160
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,480
before depositions he calls me up

161
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,379
we had done a prior radio show talking
in general about possible defenses

162
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:53,620
very generalized defenses is that we
talk about these on the radio

163
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,490
and somehow he felt

164
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,399
that breached our client attorney
privilege

165
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,149
I pasa by several other attorneys

166
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,209
and they said the man wanted out

167
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:11,999
someone scared him in security and badly

168
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:15,410
would you like to interject something on
this issue we going

169
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,389
%uh yes because the attorney-client
privilege is always something that's

170
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:23,860
the clients to choose to do with what he
wants and

171
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,009
so that that is really improper

172
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:30,360
almost unethical behavior of an attorney
to

173
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,730
to to withdraw over that sunau

174
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,759
depositions are gonna happen believe you
me

175
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:44,040
you think actually being right in the
courtroom a scary these depositions were

176
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,779
scary

177
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:48,649
these people have big key this is
DirecTV

178
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,829
is anybody really know who DirecTV
really is

179
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:55,679
and who else

180
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:02,240
Hughes aerospace that's correct well I
gotta tell you

181
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,459
they own the American Constitution

182
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:09,390
are cast

183
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,949
they do our constitution was traded for
dollars

184
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,780
you know I spent three tours in vietnam
twenty years in a military

185
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,569
intelligence fighting for this

186
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,540
this not exist your American
Constitution is the American dollar

187
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,000
exactly what is hand

188
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,850
has been a real to thank me I'm sure
when he disagrees with that

189
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,000
she's an attorney but folks really

190
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,980
years innocent innocence is determined
by the amount of money in your wallet

191
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,470
is not determined about what is right
and what is wrong

192
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,580
the amount of money in your wallet to
make a long story short because I know

193
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,630
these guys wanna get outta some stuff to

194
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,240
I was sued the judgment was one million
dollars

195
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,840
today this judgement has not been
satisfied

196
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,660
still hangs over my head and I like to
read a a letter

197
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,969
yeah a bullet right when you read this

198
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,180
s hard that my attorney wrote

199
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,620
in the final issue

200
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,840
your subscribers it pains me as the
attorney dan morgan

201
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,870
Morgan aerospace Inc and subtle i watch
news to announce that this is the last

202
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,450
issue of the magazine

203
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,330
unfortunately the unlimited resources
and bankrolled DirecTV and other

204
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,100
plaintiffs a

205
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,690
literally forced subtle i watch news and
dan Morgan to shut down operations

206
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,470
and market has been for spiced DirecTV
to close the satellite watch news

207
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,250
the DB one radio show has basically been
banned from participating in anything to

208
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:47,760
do with

209
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,180
underground satellite technology
permanent injunction has been ordered by

210
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,840
the United States District Court

211
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,030
Eastern District of Michigan prohibiting
dan Morgan and Morgan aerospace Inc from

212
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,220
publishing selling

213
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,380
and any issues satellite watch news
publishing are accepting for publication

214
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,310
any advertisements for the sale or use a
counterfeit access cards

215
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,188
then is also prohibited from publishing
are accepting for publication any

216
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,329
information intended to promote the use

217
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,510
counterfeit access cards are to assist
third persons in the use of satellite

218
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,339
signal theft

219
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,629
devices and finally has been required to
turn over

220
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:27,970
master copy and all other cop is a
pirate video 9

221
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,490
to the plaintiffs be interesting to see
if DirecTV will pick on someone its own

222
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,010
size in the near future

223
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,840
hopefully it'll be a corporation with
the financial backing and resources to

224
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,590
really determine whether it is legal for
a publisher to sell advertising space to

225
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,209
a vendor

226
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:47,240
deals on merchandise for those deemed
illegal within the United States

227
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,470
their numerous magazines that continue
to do so today

228
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,530
the attitude in the world today is
frightening

229
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,970
as a young man I've listened to people
tell me that Americans changed

230
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,480
listen for years about the insidious
nature and I'm agenda the big business

231
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,980
and government has taken on

232
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,230
really resisted the temptation to
believe nobody wants to be betrayed

233
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,230
nobody wants to believe that because of
money and greed that our nation is at

234
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,950
risk of losing its heart and soul

235
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,940
the Constitution principles of freedom
of speech freedom of association

236
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,110
freedom of the press privacy rights all
BM

237
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:24,080
bombarded by corporate america by your
own government that's basically it

238
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,010
that's the way it says is that you know

239
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,830
we're all going to get one day and again
I cannot still in you

240
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,379
how important it is to do something
about something when it's actually being

241
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,679
done to you and it's wrong

242
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,309
don't sit in weight to protect your
constitution folks

243
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,668
if you get a chance to make a difference
most people

244
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,649
will never will never believe what
happens to us because they've never been

245
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:48,590
in her shoes

246
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,428
ever they said home they hear about this
the year but they had to go all good

247
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:54,049
good good but what happens when they're
gone

248
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:59,730
while what do I do if you start taking
care what's left to the Constitution

249
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,440
have anything

250
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,799
you'll have it if you ever need it and
we can talk about this a lot more later

251
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,570
I want these guys get on with their
stuff do thank you sharp

252
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,649
I

253
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:18,830
I think one thing for July will
certainly wholeheartedly endorse

254
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,230
is that money and law

255
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,639
-ism big concern arm

256
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:30,470
as it's in the news that are you know
the the unlimited resources

257
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,539
that companies can bring to bear against
you when you're threatening a revenue

258
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:35,210
stream

259
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,760
is staggering until it's centered on you
arm

260
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,769
and you don't really realize the scope
of the people you pissed off

261
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:47,529
arm and until you until you see what
their

262
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:51,529
what they're coming after you with
virtual I basically soca

263
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:55,370
took a crack at arm a campus card system

264
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,529
something that olive you if you go to
university deeper

265
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:02,799
you probably have something that looks
like this

266
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,480
scumbag stripe on the back and this is
my life

267
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,730
college I

268
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,299
actually coincidentally enough after
after virtual I raised a big stink about

269
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,860
the security of these things

270
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,090
audience to I get to Georgians to
technology they

271
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,389
implemented a plan that was supposed to
be deployed over three years removing a

272
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,390
social security numbers from the cards

273
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,460
they redeployed in three months after
our article came out and after we got

274
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,250
suit so

275
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,160
there was a there was a plus side had

276
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,470
yeah on that for the record I if you you
have cards

277
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,549
I like that most you probably do they
pry use this the exact same system

278
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,790
on and we're just really the interested
people just looking at things

279
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,530
and walls around look interesting and of
course like

280
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,399
addressed view like them something
interesting we publish week

281
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,559
ass is published article and to 600 and
then you know I L

282
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,559
later I tried to present our clients at
a conference

283
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,918
headquarters that very pertinent things
you know it's like everywhere and

284
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,510
and the me a knock at the door and ass
is Johnny X telling us

285
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,480
that owned the lawyers are coming cycle
haha

286
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,260
I mean you don't like what I'm you know
is this entire thing was not really

287
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,929
expected

288
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:20,559
i'm too to mom print likely that

289
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,879
that's really the key here is you do
things that you don't really expect

290
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,110
anyone to care about I mean the funny
thing is if we had gotten sued we would

291
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,360
have

292
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,770
gave a presentation in front of you know
200 something people about

293
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,650
what we thought is a pretty interesting
system and that would probably be the

294
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,169
end of it

295
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,220
on as laszlo pointed out at the big cave
teams in this conference

296
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,280
is become the media you need to educate
people I think for July

297
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,379
though a pretty big debt to the fact we
didn't get screwed more

298
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,299
is because our story was picked up by
Slashdot they talked about it on off the

299
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:52,700
hook

300
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,049
on people were sending made blackboard
was getting such

301
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:59,360
bad negative press they wanted to and
this is quickly and

302
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,600
painlessly as possible on and getting
the mainstream public to understand more

303
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,480
about hacking

304
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,850
on you know they see other we're on the
front page in the washington post

305
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,450
incision hackers

306
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,679
prevented from giving talk and you know
your

307
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,960
average you know joe six-pack is gonna
see that god damn hackers try to take my

308
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,679
credit card number fucked

309
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:21,339
that's what they're good so they're
going to say and you

310
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:25,339
its it's all about educating them that
it's more for July we're looking at we

311
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:26,440
do simple research

312
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,339
as I said if you go to University you
have to use this you don't have an

313
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:29,839
alternative

314
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,570
on and our initial thing was we were
concerned about the security of this

315
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,559
a gram we can't really talk to
specifically about what we found we

316
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:41,158
for anything about that's kinda like
what we got sued the information is out

317
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,969
there it's been published its been
mirrored

318
00:22:42,969 --> 00:22:47,369
on we view this is a rather innocuous
thing

319
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:52,349
we viewed it as something we saw that it
was a wrong we thought we could address

320
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:57,249
we did research into it arm and we never
expected

321
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,570
that a corporation would react as
violently as we did on

322
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,809
a friend of ours gave us a a t-shirt
kinda all of the american express

323
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:04,700
commercials and says

324
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,159
EF at membership twenty dollars no
international right industrial

325
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:12,690
espionage Act violation you know half a
million dollars

326
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,570
DMCA violation which we also were
threatened with but not charged with

327
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,089
half a million dollars in San back

328
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:23,129
asses and virtual shut the hell up
priceless and that's what they'll do

329
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:23,629
they

330
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:28,349
they will use unlimited amounts of funds
and try to scare the hell out of you

331
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:32,859
arm to stop talking and to be quite
frank it works pretty effectively

332
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:36,799
it does you know I i'm not gonna try say
yes I'm breaking all stand up you know

333
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,339
when you're

334
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:41,289
22 years old you don't have I make less
than 10 grand a year

335
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:44,059
and now I'm on college loans in a
corporation comes up to you and says

336
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:44,979
we're going to

337
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:49,009
screw you over we're going to sue you
we're going to you know

338
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:52,669
threaten all sorts of felonies and
misdemeanors and everything

339
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:57,409
when you feel you're just doing a the
right thing it's very overwhelming

340
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:01,109
on pork chop in the previous talkie set
something really good there's a

341
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,070
difference between

342
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,439
on up legality and morality

343
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,389
I N I don't think even now for July
whatever question

344
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:12,339
our morality in this we felt we were
doing the right thing we thought we were

345
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:13,109
trying to educate

346
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:16,668
I and prevent problems and

347
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:21,440
the legality have trying to cut up to is
pretty quickly

348
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,120
I week you even evens I mean you get you
guys get past your twenty years old is

349
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,370
it

350
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,959
you ten thousand dollars a year I was
like I've been in my spot

351
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,520
hundred fifty thousand dollar a year
business taken away from you overnight

352
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,990
bank which

353
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,180
I mean it was just gone they took it

354
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,960
they shut it down as a matter fact they
had a federal marshal come up

355
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,700
in like the place up until everything
they could be reproduced

356
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,440
was gone free ski area it is

357
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,370
especially like when we say it's its
things we view as

358
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,560
as information things that are
ultimately supposed to be protecting you

359
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,830
%ah these companies don't really care
about protecting you I'm not speaking of

360
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,250
any

361
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,760
specifically this is I become rather
G-eight it since getting sued have come

362
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,510
to a conclusion

363
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,580
look at Diebold in this on the the
voting we have sure when

364
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,060
future doctor ever about this on they
don't care about

365
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,320
having a paper backed ballots the they
really don't care about the democratic

366
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,629
process the care about making money

367
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,680
when they see you know two kids from the
south to

368
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,950
in or doing research in saying you know
maybe this isn't a good idea

369
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,220
that they don't see to people trying to
do the right thing they see

370
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,690
a threat to the revenue stream and they
wanna crushed as quickly as possible

371
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,300
they will bring

372
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,860
the full weight love the laws that they
paid special interest groups to get past

373
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,940
like the DMCA

374
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,100
on the Espionage Act against you %uh and

375
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,410
so the big thing to take away from this
is learn about what the hell people are

376
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,070
passing

377
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,240
learn about what the Zacks actually say
learn about why

378
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,490
innovation and research into seemingly
innocuous

379
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,000
areas you're gonna get screwed on I
think

380
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,010
I am something else that I was like very
on

381
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,240
interesting and in our experience that
you pound your other places

382
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,570
on asses and I like beer at the NCAA
like we're its last you like everyone

383
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,159
else and I'm sure knew these things

384
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,800
on so you know we're your computer you
know kinda careful when we like doing

385
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,140
our research has like will

386
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,000
you want to like many no violations or
anything on

387
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,060
but once again once once he became a
threat to

388
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,600
to which isn't revenue stream like all
sorts of laws you've never heard of it

389
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,430
is all this I just come out the woodwork

390
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,610
and on

391
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:31,299
like lot my classic ones that we
threatened with respect with the

392
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:36,340
see the industrial espionage act at them
can Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

393
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,580
our legal wiretapping also is a crazy
stuff

394
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,490
yeah and I'll well know the most

395
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,419
like a great deal of the other tech laws
especially pass at the state and local

396
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,150
level

397
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,270
are their children like people who have
extremely little

398
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,629
little clue and no one really knows what
they mean

399
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,710
because like they're they're brand new
law they haven't been well tested and

400
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,720
and Juliet if you're just some some
random

401
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,720
security researcher you'd rather than
not be tested on you have because

402
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,399
because I all the penalties all say
around half a mil

403
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:16,330
you know which is cover-up for a college
student gather I'll

404
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,439
the point is we're not trying to to doom
and gloom in

405
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,039
and frighten you I actually as I said
more morley

406
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,890
we don't release see any problem with
what we did I mean yes

407
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,480
we acknowledge it would be wrong for
someone to go out physically vandalize

408
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,340
systems in

409
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,360
and do particular things but in the
spirit of independence security research

410
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,490
we are all for that and the key is watch
your back and protect yourself

411
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,100
arm as I really think that's gonna like
I would like to

412
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,659
try to discuss and certainly answer any
questions tree wells here would

413
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:49,799
document your steps document what you're
doing

414
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,850
on and virtual height had this
discussion before

415
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,460
anything you're doing anyway results in
possibly threatening some type of

416
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,370
corporation before you publish your
research go you know by an hour to

417
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,490
overtake lawyers time

418
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,850
and talk with them about what you're
doing on the

419
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,399
easiest way to protect yourself this
document every step of the way what

420
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,049
you're doing

421
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:12,820
so after the fact they can say oh you
did

422
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,840
XY and z. and that's why we're suing

423
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,350
ya I would like double second that I
mean

424
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,700
again like not on billy I we're not
expecting

425
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,480
like this to happen

426
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,510
I mean to put it lightly com Maria

427
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,830
and know if

428
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,850
if EU like in if you're like own
research

429
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,010
it easing that you do could be a threat
to some major corporations revenue

430
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:40,510
stream

431
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,230
you should you should think about this
you know before you actually publisher

432
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,900
or do it on because they will be all
sorts of weird things you

433
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,070
you can never heard of that will be
brought to bear on you if they so choose

434
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,700
to bring it and if they do

435
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,240
there's not much you can do about it
yeah that the best thing is

436
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,400
to really do research site near steps go
to be at that website

437
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,970
learn about the difference tween a trade
secret a copyright a patent learn them I

438
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,340
mean

439
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,440
we we were getting nailed under Trade
Secrets Act

440
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,270
I think just recently the study CSS some
judge overturned

441
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,320
some ruling it was basically saying

442
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,960
dcfs is no lockers CSS is no longer
trade secret you can possibly prosecute

443
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,640
people for

444
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,929
continuing publishes code however if
you're going after someone who has

445
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:29,780
a a patent or copyright on this on they
can tell you

446
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,309
on in our particular instance what we
were examining

447
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:36,470
they were saying oh that's a trade
secret information trade secret

448
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:40,690
information it's only trade seekers they
take necessary steps trying to protect

449
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,590
like

450
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,600
I from atlanta and you know coca-cola
has like the coke formula

451
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,850
in a vault inside another fault with
guard dogs in you know

452
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,390
like guards in notes of anybody actually
got the

453
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,530
trade secret you couldn't really
publisher because they've taken

454
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,158
accurate steps to protect they've taken
means to do so

455
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,409
on so go to web sites research arm

456
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:05,400
find out what it is you're tackling on
and

457
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,610
definitely try to separate the the
morals from legalese and

458
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,960
worst comes to worst published
anonymously you know you know they're

459
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,890
really defined

460
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,030
that if you're doing good in doing well

461
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:19,418
they will come and see you you don't
know what the hell you talking about

462
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:20,460
they leave you alone

463
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,840
yes just pretend you don't know anything
about it when I was in court with

464
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,740
DIRECTV

465
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,470
Larry wrestler who is the cheaper
security for DirecTV

466
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,289
pot the other side he said you know it's
a good day some he has been talked about

467
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,809
in our competence that you know about
the more about the internal workings

468
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:37,950
a bar

469
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,790
satellite system than we do well I took
it as quite a compliment

470
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,629
but then you know you stop and think
about it you can't figure out why you're

471
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,510
being seepage

472
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,810
you doing it good you doing it well
itself that happens

473
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,950
sir I actually have a quote on my
website and it

474
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,800
its political manifesto as as I'm a
hacker and you are frayed and that makes

475
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,440
you more dangerous than I ever could be

476
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,650
and so that's why I really liked the
color theme in this whole conference is

477
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,160
getting people to kinda breakdown

478
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,300
those barriers and curiosity in

479
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,540
and is not a crime it should not be a
crime %uh

480
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,030
and to some extent it is right now and
that's a very sad

481
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:17,180
think I think and

482
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,750
we need to try to take what steps
necessary educate people me

483
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,610
you actually sit down and explain to
someone the DVD region encoding system

484
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:24,920
like

485
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,840
that's the stupidest thing I've ever
heard Itzel

486
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,910
I bought that I bought this what do you
mean so

487
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:37,280
whitey yet so I'm left law school bit of
an idealist

488
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,330
thinking that whoever made the best
legal argument in court whoever wrote

489
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,419
the best briefs and did the most
thorough legal research

490
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,080
would be able to win and unfortunately
more and more

491
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,639
as i've seen the system in operation
since then

492
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,790
I've realized Howman much resources

493
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:58,500
often how much money it takes to get to
the stage where you can make that

494
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,460
argument

495
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,660
and I its a sad fact of life that's

496
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,740
the American legal system costs on of a
law that costs a lot

497
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,580
to defended to write my answer to
complaint it costs more to

498
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:17,300
defend depositions and take depositions
and to produce documents in response to

499
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,190
discovery

500
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,750
and it takes a lot to challenge

501
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,180
someone who has the resources to fight

502
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,990
out but we're not content leaving the
system that way

503
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,900
we don't want this to become a totally
corporate driven system

504
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,390
where even though the laws are nicely
written out on paper

505
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,660
the ordinary citizen can't take
advantage of them

506
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,990
on and that in part that's why

507
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,679
BFF exists it's why ACLU exists

508
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,539
that's why legal aid bureaus exist there
are organizations out there trying to

509
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:58,720
might help the individuals the
nonprofit's the disadvantage

510
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,059
the underprivileged be impoverished out
to fight back

511
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:06,269
and to fight for for justice

512
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:10,789
as the laws are written and it's also
why I am appealing to you to become

513
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,730
politically active to understand the law

514
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,019
and to understand how the law impact
your activities

515
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:20,230
so that you can go get back and educate
your friends

516
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:23,369
about why why it's important to vote

517
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:27,200
and so that you can go educate your
representatives start out on a local

518
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,799
level

519
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,639
school a state-level tell your
representatives about the importance a

520
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:35,419
being able to investigate the importance
of protecting knowledge and

521
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,360
understanding of technology

522
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,869
why it's so important not talk about
hacking talk about the freedom to tinker

523
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:43,749
and the freedom to understand

524
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:47,480
the freedom to know what's going on
inside that black box the sitting

525
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,999
under your desk or on your television
the freedom to

526
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:55,240
know what's going on so that you can be
the next generation and innovators

527
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,559
so that you can produce the next TiVo
the next PC the next operating system

528
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,019
the next jump up technological
innovation that

529
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:08,369
at that this country depends on for its
productivity

530
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:12,500
and tell them if that knowledge is
locked up

531
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,219
the way corporations want it to be there
will be no next generation

532
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,329
technological innovation will stagnate
it will die with what we have now

533
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:26,230
DVD hasn't changed in five years because
it's been locked up with the CSS

534
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,440
encryption format

535
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,059
and a way above contracts between the
major motion picture studios in the tech

536
00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:35,609
Knology vendors who make authorized DVD
players

537
00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:41,270
as a result we've got nothing like the
BCR improvement over

538
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,710
basic television with get nothing that
allows us to make excerpts from DVD's

539
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,230
and if you wanna store 100 movies on a
server in your closet so that you can

540
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,369
watch them by pressing a button instead
of

541
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:58,339
fiddling with discs in plastic cases you
gonna spend thirty thousand dollar

542
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:02,150
us that's not the cost at the hardware
that's the cost of all the the licensing

543
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,450
agreements and that's the cost of all of
these

544
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:09,460
claim to trade secrets and claimed
copyright anti circumvention protections

545
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,460
we want innovation costs less and is
available to more people

546
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,660
and that's what we need to be telling
our representatives

547
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,549
we need that for the general public not
these special interest protections that

548
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:25,450
they're being encouraged to enact

549
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,460
if you've heard about the induce act
that would

550
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,599
add a new level of copyright liability

551
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,029
to anyone who aids abets or induces a
copyright infringement

552
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:39,309
at that something that's that before

553
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:43,099
committee in the senate right now they
need to be told that

554
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,749
that could outlaw Apple's say love the
iPod it could outlaw

555
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:52,979
any a manufacturer Salem hardest could
outlaw journalists writing about

556
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:56,119
all of the wonderful things you can do
with technology

557
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:59,529
because someone might the aided by one
of their articles

558
00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:02,680
to infringe your copyright and we need
you

559
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,069
everyone in this audience and everyone
that you can tell to be talking to

560
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:10,499
your elected representatives or they're
serving you

561
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:15,960
need to tell them let's make the laws
work for us again

562
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,960
very good what she saying but they're
going to make a new law

563
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,590
if they're going to make a new law learn
about the largest don't ignore

564
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:32,050
even though doesn't pertain to you study
it if you think it pertains going to

565
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,890
hurt america

566
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,890
pipe for your rates your when he brings
up a really good point

567
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,118
and I think relates directly back to the
the shutting down of this

568
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:43,580
to satellite news article no you'll
notice

569
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,500
Packers if they have you know jobs IT
jobs they are normally

570
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,900
either in administration in the security
industry akers artsy or going man I want

571
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,980
to figure out how to crack this system
in NJ I can keep cracking

572
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,320
go is is a bad no he says the actor 15
and Richard at you want to break

573
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,880
something

574
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,970
but the bigger part attacking is the
creation

575
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,720
arm Packers you know you can expose the
problems in

576
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,940
leap so you don't make the same damn
steaks again arm

577
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,890
the just settling newsletter was
exposing the problem with having

578
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,049
the prom based authentication systems
for accessing satellite networks

579
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,090
and by having that information available
you know

580
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,520
the the 15-year the 17-year-old kid
who's entering college in his interest

581
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,170
in this

582
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,950
you know that's as a picky can examine
it something he can learn its

583
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,350
you can write a thesis on the next
generation way to do thinks

584
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:37,060
I mean marconi and everyone else they
would it make it

585
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,170
then shins if the previous inventions
have been a black box

586
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,420
with a little button on it that encrypt
it stuff coming out and if you took that

587
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,160
box apart

588
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,230
you get sued if you try to figure out
what that data coming out of his you get

589
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,140
sued its

590
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,509
the stagnation innovation nice basing
this is incredible

591
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,800
you wanna was really funny is the
encryption system

592
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,000
that direct TV use

593
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,859
in the United States was developed by
News datacom

594
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:06,549
the same that very same encryption
system the smart card

595
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,540
that was used by the very well-known sky
be sky system in Europe

596
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,270
it was wit it was cracked years before
DirecTV

597
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,750
implemented their rector home system
here utilize the same thing

598
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,119
I mean why would general motors by
unknown flat tire

599
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,530
you know it's pretty weird isn't it

600
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:30,980
it the nice thing to know though is it
work we are kinda being

601
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,619
doom and gloom askin single out and and
you know try to fight it

602
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:38,630
almost and for some extent people are
are our understanding

603
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,950
my dad asked me the other day so explain
this whole open source offer to me and

604
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,060
why it's good why is

605
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,860
publishing and set up up proprietary
enclose standards good I mean the MTA is

606
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,100
just trying to protect the revenue
stream that make sense

607
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,660
slight I understand protecting revenue
stream

608
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,740
but if you open yourself up you

609
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,070
allow for more nervy innovation I'm 20
minutes Gentiva 20 though i think is a

610
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,200
prime example

611
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,619
a company that understands the
importance are being able to still have

612
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:07,630
a business model

613
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,210
but make itself open for innovation I
mean TiVo's are starting to come now

614
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,340
with network ports and stuff built-in

615
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:17,190
because people hack the original TiVo's
to include network cards because they

616
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,380
didn't want to use a modem

617
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,470
I mean I'm a college student I don't
have local phone service

618
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,950
I you know buying cell phone and I have
high-speed internet so

619
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,360
TVA does me no good I don't wanna pay
thirty dollars a month so my Tivo

620
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,040
in addition to Tebow meets so you know
people took the TiVo part today let's

621
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,690
put this in

622
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,160
TiVo is sitting there going damn we have

623
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,859
a motivated intelligent and more
importantly

624
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:44,090
unpaid research pull out here which is
good in its market research

625
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,600
water people interested in we've we
develop this product people use the

626
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,868
product in them when they see

627
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,290
a niche that doesn't fill they develop
34

628
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,359
they release it under this License that
looks us use it to

629
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,119
everyone wins and I think companies are
starting to see that

630
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,580
I think that you need to encourage that
arm

631
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,670
it's the only way you're going to start
getting some these laws overturned when

632
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,650
pursues corporations realize that

633
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,359
arm proprietary and closed models

634
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,240
arm do not in any way protect the
revenue stream more so than an open

635
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,330
model or excuse me

636
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,420
rather than an open model does not
threaten the revenue stream that when

637
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:19,810
brace

638
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,350
they will because they don't care about
they care about the money so

639
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,100
you know she tell people about you know
Tebow's model love innovation

640
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,600
try to get more people interested in
this its it'll

641
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,759
open everything up pickings a lot more

642
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:39,520
easy for the rest of us we will get sued
are there clearly lots of things being

643
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,170
said here

644
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,880
II I think like line like real key
points that if you're

645
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,160
like nothing else archer for this this
is that

646
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,339
if you're doing research and you can
cite rights binoculars

647
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,140
but you think they say hey this might
threaten some companies revenue stream

648
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,790
in particular if if this company's
parent parent pant pant pant company is

649
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,110
G

650
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:02,850
year GM for someone really big no idea
on

651
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:07,029
well you know you should think about
this ahead because I'm the second you do

652
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,390
that

653
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,319
for the revenue stream a huge weight can
be brought on you in an instant

654
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,760
the only thing to do is catch their eye
Islands so

655
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,910
so before you like to anything are
certainly like reblogged they react to

656
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,859
talk to a lawyer

657
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,790
before you publish or research anything
that they might be threatening

658
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,210
like virtual our looking at our our
lawyer gives this nation up

659
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,210
approximately half a million dollars
worth of defense fees

660
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,440
army and probably a 23 year

661
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,580
trial with extensions appeals reversals

662
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,819
up what we're looking at just so we
could talk in front of 200 people

663
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,230
about something that probably not enough
people should

664
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,410
not enough people do care about me
should do more and just for the right to

665
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,310
talk to you for 200 people about a
security issue

666
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,520
we're looking at having to pay half a
million dollars and essentially three

667
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,590
years consuming

668
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,370
our lives arm that is the type of
witness people who bring to bear on you

669
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:04,270
I to be quite intimidating and so talk
with the lawyer

670
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:08,400
we analyzed what they were looking at us
with undecided

671
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,890
you know based on a few very slight
things

672
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:15,810
we felt confident in our ability to
fight this but we are worried that

673
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,840
one small technicality could overturn
the entire issue

674
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,470
and granted the entire case probably
thrown out would still have half a

675
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,970
million dollars worth of legal piece

676
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,940
these today your

677
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
I'm act

678
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,529
when Edward short just two to
reemphasize

679
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:36,839
thereof the the wait old legal fees and
legal expenses

680
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:40,720
there are add sir strategies

681
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,809
before I getting

682
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:48,109
getting beyond sum up that we can do
things like

683
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:51,430
declaratory judgment complaints

684
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,769
where before you get sued if you have

685
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:58,799
a threat that somebody's going to sue
you if you do something further

686
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:03,210
up then weekend bring the lawsuit on
your behalf

687
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:08,410
where at although it's still expensive
to defend you don't have the risk

688
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,328
love a tremendous judgment on the other
side on

689
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:16,990
and what we've tried that with a little
twist

690
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:21,910
in the D Bold case that was mentioned
earlier

691
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,910
Wendy bold was threatening people for
posting

692
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,629
excerpts from and email archives from

693
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,930
d bowls technicians discussions abode

694
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:38,000
in securities e-voting machines they
sent threat letters to ISP is

695
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,750
threatening

696
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:42,839
litigation if the ISP's didn't cut off
their customers

697
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:46,279
for posting colleges didn't cut off
their students

698
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:49,430
for posting these email archives and

699
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,940
on behalf of one ISP the online policy
group

700
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:59,130
and swarthmore students we took that
into court and we sue DeBolt

701
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:03,690
for misusing copyright and for
declaratory judgment that copyright

702
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:04,359
doesn't

703
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:07,740
extend to that prohibit to

704
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,049
blocking important political speech hot
and their

705
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:15,839
we're still waiting for the ruling but
we're hoping to get

706
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,009
a ruling that says you know there are
limits to copyright

707
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:24,250
there are limits to what you can
threaten and get away with it

708
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:27,259
and if if we can even rich

709
00:44:27,259 --> 00:44:31,450
recover attorney's fees in that case
then it will be

710
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:35,920
another avenue to go forward at to help
people say

711
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,960
you know the law stop some place

712
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,830
here's where we come back and reclaim
our rights okay we'll

713
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,580
with anybody has any questions for any
of us come on up where

714
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:54,170
more than glad to answer we have contest
we have some great souls

715
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:58,970
we have some tassels a I've got a
question for you to add a scab in the

716
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,580
interest of disclosure I said

717
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,529
say that I'm Johnny act sum up the
organizers up the inner zone convention

718
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:05,240
in atlanta

719
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,710
and I'm the guy had to deliver the bad
news to

720
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:14,460
are gonna set us up there I am will
background here the way that

721
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,500
they were served is that the other
convention organizer who's not here at

722
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:18,970
Hope

723
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:24,050
received and email cease and desist
about 12 hours before their talk

724
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,990
and that was followed up the next day by
a curry are delivering papers to the

725
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:29,710
hotel

726
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,800
and actually delivering them to the
hotel staff

727
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,030
at the front desk I the papers were

728
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:42,000
addressed to alias is not individuals no
one's real name was on there anything

729
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,810
like that

730
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,259
it's really funny when you get a FedEx
package for acid

731
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,700
brother Joel code poet

732
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,290
far interns own organizers and that's
how they were addressed and

733
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,600
we talk with these guys we know what our
legal rights where we were work has

734
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,780
stupid and that we didn't have a lawyer
on hand at the convention

735
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,300
we've learned sense and we figured it
would probably be

736
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,410
best to go ahead and just not do the
talk

737
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:13,100
and see if we get this resolved I easily
without anyone getting hurt

738
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,730
the lawyers being and the east and a
year on down the road

739
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:20,690
I am I've have changed my mind on that

740
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,359
I mean you guys got fucked and you can't

741
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:28,310
talk about this and you had legitimate
security concerns

742
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:31,060
and I feel like we kinda que bien

743
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,720
and it would have been very easy to
claim after the fact that

744
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,600
you know what the fuck you talking about
we were never properly serve to CNN

745
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,340
email

746
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,340
you delivered stuff too Virgil code poet
and had the front desk guy at the hotel

747
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,320
sign for it I mean I didn't know who to
get this to you we had no idea

748
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,550
that you guys were trying to get in
touch with this before this happen yeah

749
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,760
hello phone call to the hotel asking for
the organizers why use in cops down or

750
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,280
something

751
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,440
I am I I think we should be gone for

752
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,390
and our what you guys think I mean you
are the ones really who are facing the

753
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:04,080
five hundred thousand dollars and

754
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,490
fees in the NCAA charges and wisdom
other the other big domestic

755
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,220
economic terrorism or espionage and in a
long trial

756
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:16,560
what what your opinions now year after
the fact on

757
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,700
I think we're out there is mostly morse

758
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,270
pretty depressing on it was not see that
like

759
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,680
vast majority the laws the either just
flat-out bad

760
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:33,200
or no one really knows what they mean
and they all carry extremely heavy fines

761
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,900
or extremely heavy Prince Prince
incidences and

762
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,220
and Julia you don't want to be a one
that finds out with these laws mean

763
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:46,030
since no one really does and is because
wealthy comes out on your favorite well

764
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:46,790
that's very bad

765
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,920
on WEA

766
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,480
yeah i doubt i woulda dining differently
I must admit it really does suck

767
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,740
but well chip

768
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,210
II don't miss out to be the one who
spends like five years

769
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:05,069
losing you go into debt for a very long
time and then find out I go to prison

770
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:06,019
for 15 years

771
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:09,299
now we were never charged criminally

772
00:48:09,299 --> 00:48:12,509
I these were all civil cases and

773
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,740
we're says the gym with the civil
version of a lot of these

774
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:19,319
I'm criminal laws that you'll hear about
some other more them attackers can

775
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:19,980
charge with

776
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,430
om is actually came down to

777
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,490
with discussions with our lawyers we
felt

778
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:29,609
fairly confident with the intent

779
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:33,500
we ate we had a past history showing
that this was this was not for

780
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,700
economic gain this was for on
interoperability

781
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,829
or for education and security on we were
concerned about

782
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:43,900
a little bit with how research was
conducted which is why

783
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,680
stress document your steps and we were
very concerned that after five years

784
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,230
judge would essentially say to the
defendant's

785
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,240
you guys got nothin and then say to the
said us you guys did just one little

786
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:54,910
thing so

787
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:58,160
I'm dismissing this we we could not be
guaranteed

788
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,269
we went to its insane amount of debt
this so we reached

789
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:05,519
a settlement agreement which
unfortunately we can't tell you the

790
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:06,289
terms of it

791
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:11,309
on and all parties ended up walking away
from it

792
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:17,940
reasonably content this is a follow-up
to that I think it's interesting that

793
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,119
a all that I bowled I mean I partner
blackboard

794
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,240
I press releases afterwards for claiming
that

795
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,089
I it never would have worked on you guys
didn't know what you're talking about

796
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:33,930
yeah I'm spin spin spin spin spin and
under the mainstream press seemed

797
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,220
picked up or comment on the fact that if
you didn't know what you're talking

798
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,009
about

799
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:42,529
they would ensue a lot easier to let you
make fools have yourselves a technical

800
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:43,210
convention

801
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:46,529
then have I'm saeb law which is also

802
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:49,740
for president clinton's law firm in late
charges shitload of money

803
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,420
come after you guys yeah why not let you
embarrass ourselves in public and let me

804
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,569
know I get picked apart

805
00:49:55,569 --> 00:49:58,549
if they really didn't know what they
were talking about and now know

806
00:49:58,549 --> 00:49:59,619
everything yeah

807
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:02,980
well that was a rhetorical question that
directive you I would like to say that

808
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,180
closing that everything that you
couldn't talk about

809
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:13,379
and more is I am now on the Internet and
all sorts of fun new exploits have come

810
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,289
out and

811
00:50:14,289 --> 00:50:21,289
go Google so there you go yes thanks

812
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,180

or thank you and Dom I love it was
ninety six or nine

815
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,260
whenever Direct TV star US problems here

816
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,859
after I am I called up subscribe I
believe the woman taking prescription

817
00:50:38,859 --> 00:50:40,310
was your wife /url

818
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:43,599
know I've never worked for me okay but
she it said

819
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,670
where'd you hear about Sally watch news
and sad funny thing

820
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,980
I DirecTV used like to brag about it was
thrown its legal weight around you know

821
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,900
residential subscribers using it a you
know a bit a bar neighbor brag about all

822
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,020
the stuff and I saw

823
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,080
an article on DirecTV dot com about how
they were

824
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:06,180
threatening satellite watching only one
other many press releases I recall

825
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,880
I said what's a sadly watch news and
looked it up in subscribe so I thought

826
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,310
it was kinda funny that DirecTV
themselves are the reason

827
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:16,190
i subscribe well thank you that is good
to know what they think it happen

828
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:20,780
thank you sir got comment and then one
quick question

829
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,400
arm come until you guys have been a
proponent

830
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,369
love a satellite exploitation things
like that for a long time and also been

831
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:33,420
reading up a lot on the internet about
all the legal implications in the people

832
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,010
have gotten

833
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,570
screwed over like you have using and
they've just been reading every time you

834
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,570
read about some

835
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:42,670
some company that gets shut down by
DirecTV or whoever

836
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,150
I it's always for some strange

837
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:49,270
our reason that doesn't really make
sense if you applied that reason any

838
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:51,349
other like legal situation that wasn't

839
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:54,520
involved in something underground like
this all cases get thrown out

840
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,690
yeah and places like this a lot of
people do really

841
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,700
realizing got fucked over the whole
situation yeah and that's why this band

842
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,890
doesn't it's all good have this is right
back here

843
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:08,770
I 30 yea or nay they pretty well taken
away appreciate your candor

844
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:12,250
on the questions more for you guys as
with the satellite watch news is

845
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,109
cut-and-dried obvious arm you geyser

846
00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:19,150
but the average age a lot of people I
see

847
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,539
hearing your speaking in front

848
00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:25,799
a couple of floors a lot of people do
what you do like to tinker like to

849
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:29,660
go hey what does this do let's take this
apart let's see what it does and then

850
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,618
you get curious to know what if I do
this

851
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:36,559
and that applies the any situation not
even just you know magnetic stripes or

852
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:37,479
anything like that

853
00:52:37,479 --> 00:52:41,289
on and then the lot of people lotta kids
like us what they do when they find

854
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:41,880
something out

855
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,119
you posted on the internet 3 a type of
an article made you give a presentation

856
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,819
at school something like that

857
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:50,119
something you might do it for a class
all

858
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,119
what would you say were the three

859
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,859
biggest mistakes you you made

860
00:52:56,859 --> 00:53:01,259
that lead to you getting in trouble what
what could people do to avoid

861
00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:05,929
yet still presents

862
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:12,009
what they found okay um this is a

863
00:53:12,009 --> 00:53:15,009
by line up

864
00:53:15,009 --> 00:53:18,319
I I understand as a lot you can't
discuss

865
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:24,229
so I think it's more just one big
question what can people like us

866
00:53:24,229 --> 00:53:27,939
do to avoid getting in trouble yet still
share

867
00:53:27,939 --> 00:53:32,019
with the community what we found so even
though there are things like the DMCA

868
00:53:32,019 --> 00:53:36,380
arm and things like that I love
Australia which is when you buy

869
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,380
something in short

870
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,400
do whatever the hell you want with it
and that's getting routed

871
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,619
a good bit here in the United States but
there still is something other

872
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:47,319
if you own it it's okay to do it by
owned if I

873
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:50,509
bought some type of system that talked
like

874
00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:53,559
x11 cameras right i buy one those things
from my home

875
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:56,779
and I figure out how the excellent
systems and stuff talk I wasn't

876
00:53:56,779 --> 00:53:59,029
necessarily cracking somebody else's
network and

877
00:53:59,029 --> 00:54:02,769
i think im our case for you don't have a
couple million dollars to

878
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:06,099
go buy a card based systems we try to
use the one

879
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:09,709
we had it and and that was essentially
the concern is that

880
00:54:09,709 --> 00:54:13,589
we were using a resource that wasn't
ours to conduct research

881
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:16,799
without necessarily the consent to that
institution on

882
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:20,479
at least Georgia Tech they have
something that is a any research that

883
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:21,249
was done using

884
00:54:21,249 --> 00:54:24,530
Georgia Tech resources arm day

885
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:30,359
significant so I think

886
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:33,690
I think keeping someone there lotsa lost
that

887
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,930
you still hear about until you're
honestly yes on

888
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,270
before you do something that could
threaten a company's revenue stream

889
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:45,630
talk to someone about like in the now
answer and certainly try to publish just

890
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,839
published anonymously

891
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:50,119
just do not do not do it in person do
not do a conference

892
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:53,570
just some anonymous email to a list
somewhere and

893
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:57,930
course want to get published and its no
longer trade secret Danielle

894
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,310
later you can come out talk because once
everyone knows it's oscar De more

895
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:04,589
they will come after you try to keep the
genie in the bottle or being asked to

896
00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:05,839
start wrapping it up
