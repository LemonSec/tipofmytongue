3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,280
seventies

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,950
pig iron and I can really love when
having will sign it today so I would

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:15,360
like to

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,390
express some thanks to see what the
actor started my way many others with

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,480
the Apple 20 machine

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,240
our first Richard Cheshire as up

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,990
like many others have also had some
novel interesting experiences with phone

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:28,190
systems which also was a

11
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,010
a launch board for all kinds of exciting
adventures some documented and some not

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,289
on is also a top 100 some slides about
the inside

13
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,399
and the model 33 teletype or close to
our hearts

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
and he was in Iraq will do an impromptu
have any choice you want to discuss

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,079
and perhaps all BT doesn't mean that
uses K

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,460
arm ask which Cheshire to start speaking
briefly

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,659
and time comes I'll do a presentation as
well trash

18
00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:03,659
stalking

19
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,048
look for two years and you know
receiving

20
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:12,289
graduation night can never figure out
why I figures just my name is out all

21
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:12,630
those

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,070
really h2 kept it all text files about
the bad old days

23
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,240
and that you know anyway %uh

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,369
what I would like to ask it possibly
could are figure up

25
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:25,649
the character point I would have been in
know the gaming world

26
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,869
lucky plugins I'm email time you
Cheshire at 2600 dot com id like 2ca

27
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:31,229
makers appointed leadership

28
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,609
I are back in the bad old days

29
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,509
arm I got started with the I love

30
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,509
phones and things in teletype Ste I
heard that there are these personal

31
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,350
computers coming out and I was

32
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,570
are fascinated at science fiction
conventions are I hung out with people

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,039
from New England wanted loving

34
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:55,119
in our Boston because I put on a
computer games exhibit

35
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,020
at the boss can science fiction
convention Wonder Bread for company up

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,499
there

37
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:03,909
arm they went outta business six months
after they heard makes the just

38
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,920
can handle all growth they were getting
arm then

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,600
the the store opened up up in Braunton
called the computer store

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,190
they had an amazing new machine called
the LTR

41
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,810
8800 are working on and on

42
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,360
Intel a teacher and you would go in if
we could have the first slide please

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,670
in 30 seconds okay now unfortunately

44
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,500
Sam is my only be able to find imus i
8080 are with the front panel

45
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,120
again I worked on the L tears and what
we used to do

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,810
was we would using the front panel
switches

47
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,000
loading a 24 step

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,690
bootstrap directly in machine language

49
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,620
that would then load basic from

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,580
paper cheap of the model 33 teletype

51
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,100
now you know why they referred to as the
bad old days

52
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,850
then we got something in from
Albuquerque

53
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:05,930
basic a man cassette tape he had to
change

54
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,900
three or four the instructions at the
end of the twenty forceps but it still

55
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,600
took 24 steps

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,390
loading and book are the bits

57
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,660
by each switch being one bit and then
heading

58
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,390
the load button for still trying to
bring about 60 what those which is look

59
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,810
like

60
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,910
are but you'd load in the address

61
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,910
are no market as the address

62
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,950
then load in the contents for that
address

63
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,000
and then hit load and next in it would

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,100
then go to the next address and

65
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,510
you have the lights on top with the
address and then

66
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,209
what it contained are you would loaded
up twenty four times the hit that

67
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,100
all load next button until it was the
end and then you hit the button

68
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,770
%uh the switch Mark run and all that
little bootstrap program did was

69
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,970
reedy n the data from the paper tape
loaded into memory about their

70
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,609
and then jump to the startup that
program which was

71
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,260
basic basic was

72
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,820
funny little languages written a bio
young twerp kid

73
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,100
name gates I don't have you ever you
know something much

74
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,700
from that but arm the thing is that

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,510
might job the coming soon the job the
garbage in New England

76
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,330
are I was working on are deck equipment
a

77
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,800
PDP HBP tens and

78
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,260
PDP eleven's primarily and you know

79
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,690
this flavor basic that this gated came
up with as Alterra basic sure look a lot

80
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,480
like

81
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,150
our basic plus under wrist is eat for
the PDP 11

82
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,540
is there a look and feel issue here
anyway

83
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,590
hmm ok out we're getting close to
getting a graphic up

84
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,490
and didn't wanna show you

85
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,500
okay up comes the power point
presentation

86
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,750
and there's the Insight 8800 'em

87
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,389
okay you have your address which is

88
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,020
are and unload address to get you to the
address that you have

89
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,469
mark in the switches then you would us
at the switches to what you wanted to be

90
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,700
the contents have that memory location

91
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,889
when he finally had it all on the
machine you get the Run button and the

92
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,420
lights would flicker and flashing you
know all the cool the computer stuff

93
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,860
and the stuff that made into movies
because it was visual

94
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,930
that we always saw Mac 8 spinning
because

95
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,720
well these are motion pictures right so
union something like that for motion

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,880
and as well as other things

97
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,389
%uh but that a loaded the restricting
them to go to the next

98
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:52,290
slide with the motor 23 teletype see the
paper tape

99
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,780
and other paper tape arch was are in
pure

100
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,310
ASCII the telco corporation was only 50
percent owned by AT&T

101
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,010
but the other 50 percent was on by
Western Electric Corporation

102
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,960
which was wholly owned by AT&T don't ask
me and I'll

103
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,310
corporate lawyer but are ASCII came out
in time

104
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,380
when are the american Standard Code for
Information Interchange became

105
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,870
how computers talk to each other before
that

106
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,910
the whole ratko Egypt you when you roast

107
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,030
when you are got your badges for this
convention received a hollow earth card

108
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,060
and IBM card properly encoded areas

109
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,260
and those cards R&R

110
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,789
are a code called ebsen Dec extended
binary Interchange

111
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,930
whatever was but are you can google it
and find out what it means

112
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,940
but a for real computers they talk

113
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,370
ASCII the American sacred Code for
Information Interchange

114
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,230
and that out when and the control
character Kotov control cue

115
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,100
to star paper tape reader and Kontrol s2
stop paper tape reader

116
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,460
is how you always worked on the bulletin
board for a while because control as to

117
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,750
stop paper tape

118
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,590
reader well one gate is coming across
from a remote computer it looks like

119
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,980
someone just put on the paper tape it
started up

120
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,180
so he said the controllers to stop the
reader for a bit so your buffer can

121
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,850
handle it

122
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,070
and the control cute started back up
again

123
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,349
arm these became useful concepts in

124
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,820
the microcomputer world and also my
computer world something interesting

125
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,300
in the mainframe computer world you had

126
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,690
a computer operator you had a program
librarian

127
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,530
you had love the programmers themselves
you have people who handled love them

128
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,750
are the printouts I've also work in a
room at one large corporation

129
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,800
very early in my your computer are we
just took the printouts

130
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,889
which were 8 ply and Rd collated them
vertically to them

131
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,310
I'll large machine up each one

132
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,040
log on her on pile n/a roller to roll up
the carbon paper

133
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,229
that was between Ichi and to all these
different function in a computer a

134
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,090
when you had a microcomputer you did all
those jobs you were

135
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,240
the computer wrist and also I kinda took
that as

136
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,729
my title I am a consulting computer
wrist

137
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,210
and %uh that's how I hurt myself and not
everybody but I'll

138
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,410
its fine nice place in attic sometimes

139
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,800
%uh from the paper tape I think of
Stevens if you think bill

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,050
cool story great well yeah I'm I got

141
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,840
kinda started back like you mentioned
punch cards with punch cards in college

142
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,510
we bring our programs through

143
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,958
while I remember one good story when it
was finals time

144
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:38,219
everybody that use the computer in the
sky University Colorado the 6400 CBC

145
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,149
6400

146
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,649
everybody heavy use I think it was the
model 25

147
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:46,559
hard punch to type in your programs and
it would punch the holes on the cards

148
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,259
for you and that was just part of life

149
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:52,689
at finals time you'd show up and there
was a huge wait in line for people to

150
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:53,469
get on

151
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,800
the card punch as they were all in use
every one of them was in Houston you

152
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,540
have to wait

153
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,389
an hour an hour and a half sometimes
just to get your turn to tighten one

154
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:01,910
iteration

155
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,100
your program so well I him I was really
a touch typist on his card

156
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,360
punches and you hit the asterisk key and
something are there was a little ki have

157
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,649
it with your left

158
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:17,180
little finger next the spacebar as other
keys like the dq eking you get Prince

159
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,009
the season

160
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,509
percent signs what I did all by touch
instead of look

161
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,569
so what I did was I went over nobody was
usually

162
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:27,618
older model 9 team card punches

163
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:30,639
I went over to them and discovered that
if I punch by

164
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,790
tight without looking at the keyboard it
typed the wrong characters

165
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,459
but punch the right holes so I never had
to wait so that was one my little

166
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,839
gimmicks in college

167
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,800
and you know there were I think there
were like millions of people well

168
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,290
I think millions but lets a hundred
thousand maybe a million people were

169
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,509
like myself

170
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:51,939
hoping for the day we could own our own
computers because when we went to work

171
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:52,998
for a company

172
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:57,959
we would you know go up to our write a
program on paper and turn it over got to

173
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,180
win I give it to the some

174
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,449
usually a gal typing away on a key punch
she turns it into a deck of cards

175
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:07,589
we pick up the deck card from earned
over to a window and submit them

176
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,399
to the computer department and they
would run our program and which up later

177
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,059
and get a print out with our name on it
and it was like you're using this

178
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,959
company's computer it was so

179
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,259
far above us in value was like the
technology over the human

180
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:25,240
the technology was more costly more
important but we've somehow there were a

181
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,269
lot of us the just wished we had our own
computer and we were the owner Robert

182
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:32,970
and could decide what it was used for
women too quick jobs whatever we felt

183
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,850
like

184
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,879
and we've been sitting around so the
Homebrew Computer started up

185
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,959
and imus i computer had been introduced
and its

186
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,949
it told a lot of us that understood ones
and zeros and logic gates and chips

187
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:49,230
that this stock we understood was all of
a sudden affordable

188
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,809
you could buy the imus i computer for
four hundred dollars

189
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:56,779
look like an airplane cockpit you kinda
have to study computers to know how to

190
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,059
build it and use it

191
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:02,670
so it was for hobbyists wasn't for the
average Jones Street

192
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,670
but it was affordable because it was 400
bucks

193
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,209
well that was for 256 bytes avram

194
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,629
so in had a Thomas what's the plugin

195
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:16,069
all the pieces you needed to have a real
useful computer

196
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:20,189
a computer you could write a program on
basic you had to buy

197
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:25,319
teletype the cost maybe surplus 1200
bucks maybe new three thousand dollars

198
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,019
for a Sr 33 teletype

199
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,629
the slow its clunky s 10 characters a
second a tight

200
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:34,300
machine in the world with the of a
keyboard that was under case only

201
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,179
and it was so expensive you had to buy
RAM cards to get up to 4k avram to run

202
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:39,999
basic

203
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,610
and those ramparts were extremely
expensive than the plug in the slots and

204
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,639
they all had to have switches on the set
their addresses

205
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,819
had to be a real tech you do this stuff
so wasn't

206
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:54,170
for the masses but there were still on a
bus the now saw that we were closer

207
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,339
and we could somehow get there to waters
by a four hundred dollar computer

208
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,420
talk with a buncha switches on the front
and punching buttons to load them in the

209
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,209
memory

210
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,489
was greatest thing in the world it was a
computer

211
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:10,009
the could run programs it didn't matter
that it did anything useful

212
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,649
so there had to be a transition step
somehow between this machine that could

213
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,889
do nothing useful

214
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:18,059
but it was a computer and satisfied or
goals of our life

215
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,850
we have to make a transition to a
machine that could do what we really

216
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,860
wanted to do

217
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,079
we really wanted to write those programs
we rode in collagen

218
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:28,129
and for fun or work that played games
even

219
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:31,509
Bill Gates actually you know it's
amazing but I mean he's kinda known for

220
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:33,269
basically being a businessman at least

221
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,439
he had a technical start like myself I
mean I kept it up for life but

222
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:40,839
he's actually did write a basic or with
somebody else and that was

223
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:43,989
you know kinda a little bit admirable in
our club people

224
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:47,100
and we largely have a social conscience
that was roughly equivalent to the

225
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,809
people here

226
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,790
we came from a person walks of society
is the people in this room right now

227
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,639
looking around

228
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,170
we dress the same in you know we didn't
have money which was fortunate

229
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,279
but actually he was one of those heroes
here written a basic

230
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,329
every single person in the room knew
that name in you know it's like he'd

231
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,009
gotten frame for a little project that
some bus were smart enough to do

232
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:10,489
and it was very inspirational so you
know I did a lot of thinking watching

233
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:14,499
these complicated expensive machines
with all the cards plugin especially

234
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,939
if you ever wanted something like
graphics on a screen or caller

235
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:21,949
you have to plug into cards and add more
troops than the whole imus i computer

236
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:25,699
you must are thinking well fortunately
it was real lucky I was one of those

237
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:27,899
people that many years before

238
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,769
had pieced together some chips that were
given to me and managed to build a

239
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,040
little computer with switches and
lights. unload buttons on your part will

240
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,199
that in bit by bit

241
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:39,739
and you got a program in it really
random flack flickered some whites may

242
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:41,049
be all it did was take

243
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:45,439
two switches as binary are for switches
binary for other switches as binary and

244
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,099
multiply two numbers together

245
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,720
and display an 8-bit binary result on
some white media all it did

246
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,429
but I knew it was a computer in the sole
delighted with it I was really lucky to

247
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:57,670
have gone through the steps that was now
available to everyone

248
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,920
because I was trying to think how do you
really get to the point you really wanna

249
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,679
me and as

250
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,999
always for the wrong you really want
solutions in life

251
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:09,319
and i wanna basic I didn't i'd never
program in basic i'd never studied the

252
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:11,199
language I didn't know its syntax

253
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,379
but I could sniff the one with Bill
Gates basically I could tell that was

254
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:17,579
going to be the popular language for
small low-cost computers

255
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,589
because mainly because you could run
games in it there were books

256
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:24,279
101 games written in BASIC that sort of
thing so

257
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,569
are the important thing what you mean
what's the absolute minimum

258
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:30,619
I was a minimizer what's the minimum
cost

259
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:35,199
you can get things down to the could run
a machine that could

260
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,649
actually what you type in a program in
basic the two programs I want to type in

261
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:39,649
word games

262
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:42,970
like 1 posts that were text based games
at types are

263
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,199
you know a phrase have texting you
answer yes or no and

264
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,209
try this quadrant for Star Trek in
whatever those were

265
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:52,509
run was with the most amazing things you
do back in those days just like

266
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:55,889
the greatest computer games up today
a.m.

267
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,249
I also want to write little simulations
assimilated logic for my designs

268
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:04,799
at work Hewlett Packard God would I be a
hero I have a computer on my desk

269
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,290
like the type on and get answers back
immediately instead of

270
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,059
signing up for the company computer and
putting cards in or whatever an intern

271
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,179
programs and then waiting for my output
and turn it over to someone else

272
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,779
god that was a slower process I really
want to do these great things

273
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,910
myself and what was the minimum
configuration the minimum types have

274
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,779
chips

275
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,019
%uh memory a processor's I love

276
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:31,170
input and output that you could do that
would satisfy those two little means

277
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,470
games and work simulations and it boiled
down to you need 4k avram

278
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,929
4k RAM wasn't quite affordable like I
said that first names I had 256 bytes

279
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:47,040
avram that's where had to start for care
and was just becoming affordable

280
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,858
had to choose but new dynamic RAM took a
little extra thinking to design circuits

281
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:52,660
to keep it

282
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,730
keep its memory but boy that was worth
it save chips

283
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,689
arm to use the right kinda RAM have to
find a decent processor up the day at a

284
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:00,949
decent price

285
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:05,459
locked into a processor 20 bucks you
know and so

286
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,480
the biggest step up although I didn't
wanna hog all the switches and whites

287
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,720
so I put in a human keyboard now that
wasn't really a very complete step

288
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,109
towards humanizing the keep

289
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:18,709
the computer it wasn't going to give you
a computer that all of a sudden this

290
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,670
computer type

291
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,569
English and other computers pipe ones
and zeros minor

292
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:26,619
because all I wanted this keyboard to do
I wanted to write

293
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,149
256 bike program in wrong

294
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,869
which I did and took two chips back then
to have a 256 by

295
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:37,269
program in wrong it was their partners
or problems that we are

296
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,029
and all that we do is let you type base
16 numbers

297
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,549
0- 12 P project to make nine ABCDE a

298
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:47,899
type in hexadecimal and get the data in
the memory

299
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,790
little faster than talk later up on
switches but it was still a geeky binary

300
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,559
system

301
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,469
but it was just replaced that front
panel was switches and whites

302
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,109
with a keyboard that's human that was a
step a ventral E

303
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:04,069
somebody can write a language if you
build them up technology at the basis

304
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,188
somebody can develop a TechNet
technology to take it to where

305
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:11,019
you can get it to run a programming
language with the Apple to computer

306
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:14,209
was the first computer we actually put
the entire basis in wrong

307
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,120
so when you turn on the power switch be
you were typing in basic

308
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,439
I mean god I just wish something like
that ever existed today with

309
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,319
gone backwards in waterways it just made
the computer so accessible and

310
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,260
interesting

311
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,908
arm but you need to seen a lot of things
to to work out right knee below-cost

312
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:36,309
0 input/output teletype was too
expensive the only output device that

313
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,760
was free in anyone's life like my own

314
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,169
was your home TV Sunstar home TV

315
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:46,450
gathers limitations to TV signals you
can only put about 40 characters across

316
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,850
the screen be able to read them

317
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,059
I and its you know it's there were no
input there are no video in back in

318
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:53,840
those days

319
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,189
TVs in the video in so you have to be
hobbyists naked in her you had to build

320
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,210
a transmitter with no laws back in those
days arm

321
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,460
modulator I've been a ham radio operator
and I really respected ham radio is

322
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,010
having Potter somewhere the protectors
of the airwaves

323
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,860
we use them for good things you know we
not only you know jump in emergencies

324
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,220
the people communication but we need for
we prevent

325
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,870
spree is some missions those extra inner
extra radio signals in the air that

326
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,460
cause interference with people who need
to use radio for good things

327
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,539
employees when it came a time that we
develop the Apple to with the company

328
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:32,510
and we had to get the signals into a TV
on channel three

329
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,500
I just had a little a big ethical
principle I just wouldn't allow us to do

330
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,200
it

331
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,100
because there was no law saying what
levels could you transmit on

332
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,279
it's not right to build transmitters so
we actually had to get an outside

333
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:46,710
company marketing did this without
telling me

334
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,409
that they were arranging it all and tell
them where we worship it happened to

335
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:49,960
spur

336
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,340
doctors outside company to develop the
modulator I just

337
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,590
didn't wanna didn't wanna just I was too
scared to be doing these

338
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,639
some things are just order you shouldn't
do anyway

339
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,019
arm the Apple one took a big step
towards or

340
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,679
a human keyboard which suggest what was
next and what was next was I sniff the

341
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,529
air

342
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:12,370
has anyone written a basic for the 6502
microprocessor

343
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,950
like Bill Gates had a basic and
eventually time to arm

344
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,460
competent would have tiny funny basic
for I forget which movie maybe

345
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,100
maybe even 6502 and nobody had done it
oh my gosh

346
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,940
you know when you're your shiny can talk
to people the way you get in the

347
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,080
conversations it by doing great things

348
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,408
and people come up to wanna see what
you've done a new explain you know

349
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:35,370
so I thought this is gonna be great
underwrite the first basic

350
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,010
course I've never taken a class in
writing languages and I've never read

351
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,899
books on writing languages

352
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:44,289
but you know I prefer struggled in my
head to try to figure some techniques

353
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:44,908
out

354
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:49,139
i sat down and it room unbelievable
hardest job the most hours I spent

355
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:50,480
designing the first computer

356
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,179
the the Apple one was writing the basic
for many more hours

357
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,830
I was really a programmer's much the
hard work I am i software was low-level

358
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,470
kinda the way it felt like sought like
hard work very tricky

359
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,470
thousands of little lines of code you
have to keep in your head

360
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,200
at the mall right thing from another
idea to provide that you might have been

361
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,429
something might come up in

362
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,929
rearrange the code now the call I
couldn't afford December

363
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:17,019
you know how you write a program and you
assemble it and you doctor output

364
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:20,269
what we had in those days a lot of
people use and even the insights had

365
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:21,320
little cards

366
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,168
the total you wanted an instruction that
added a the dislocation memory

367
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:29,090
you have to type in 1 I'll get a
converted to a a certain set up ones and

368
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,120
zeros

369
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,440
well that was all I could you would use
the card I would write the program on

370
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,230
the left hand side of the page

371
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,409
is Michael card to figure out what the
1's and 0's we're gonna be over on the

372
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,190
right hand side of the page

373
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,019
and basically hand wrote the entire
basic that way if you had a jump

374
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,250
you had to guess how many bytes it was
jumping over you didn't have

375
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,600
when okay let's say you got a program
done it was in certain locations in your

376
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,230
ROM

377
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,389
everything was coated to started a
harder dress in a ROM I was making

378
00:20:56,389 --> 00:21:00,130
and if I had to go back and rewrite a
routine add code to it

379
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,779
I couldn't stretch everything else I
might be stretching out 4k a program the

380
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,070
basic not that you'd

381
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,720
and I was really good at typing basics
things I guess you take 4k in about 40

382
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,350
minutes

383
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,019
get it all into the computer i sat in
the back of the Homebrew Computer Club

384
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,279
the very back row because it was right
up next to an electrical outlet

385
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:19,919
likes it there during the meeting typing
my basic in debugging a couple more bits

386
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:20,169
a

387
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:23,230
bitter routines unplugging I lose
everything

388
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:28,049
arm so it was a so it was really an
amazing process to get this basic done

389
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:31,399
but I had a big advantage I had not only
design hardware

390
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:34,440
I had written the software all a bit for
the computer

391
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,610
you can make changes in your head this
would be a neat thing to add to the

392
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,210
computer a step to take

393
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,269
and because it's one person you don't
have to go through committees that sat

394
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,940
down what each one's gonna do and how
they're going to communicate

395
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,769
just add something to the basic Monday
reburn the ROM

396
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:53,019
and come back and I'm and change the
hard work you have to add a chip

397
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,350
so it was really easy to get things
develop extremely fast I would estimate

398
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,269
to the bottom ponders past

399
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:01,789
as you know projects are developed today
if you can find you know one engineer

400
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,240
the gonna do it all

401
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,179
so I have that what going for me the
Apple to came about very quickly after

402
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:08,360
the Apple one

403
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,090
and it was you know thinking about other
things are done one of them was working

404
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,939
at Atari

405
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,009
company in Los Gatos Calif started the
arcade game revolution

406
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:20,700
and they have paw and I've got my own
pong Steve Jobs came to me and got me

407
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:27,460
design breakout any you remember
breakout

408
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,250
recognize matter one of the foremost the
actual formal steps in arcade games ever

409
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,889
break it was such a huge hit Nolan
Bushnell was tired of games with more

410
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:37,120
and more chips in one

411
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,610
me design one was Steve Jobs came to be
with the project was I could design it

412
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,809
few chips and actually my design was the
coming to redesign it there because they

413
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:46,000
couldn't understand my design

414
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,500
so clever but that was different that
happens

415
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,120
arm but anywhere when in the lab four
days and nights the jobs I both got

416
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,659
mononucleosis didn't shut down our lives
and that's amazing time to develop a

417
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,769
game when it's in hardware

418
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:02,299
not software they had no microprocessor
games I heard

419
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:06,149
hints that there was gonna be a
microprocessor game well in break up

420
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:09,090
that they have they have colored strips
a plastic over the screen so

421
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,789
the bricks look colored a little I
thought were wouldn't be me take to a

422
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:13,950
trillion collar

423
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,539
and Sunday wanna be need to program a
microprocessor a million instructions a

424
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:18,490
second

425
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,759
you could play a game at that speed you
know a real arcade games were things mu

426
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,960
not type in little words like you know
the one person's near you

427
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,230
arm so so the Apple to West

428
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,759
was you know I'm you also some good
design work but also was largely adding

429
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,549
color was a huge element

430
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:40,240
but you know what I wrote the basic I
could go back into the basic and at a

431
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,320
blue team it draws a colored wine

432
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,759
about vertical or horizontal line a
certain color because I'd written by I

433
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,899
could do that instantly

434
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:50,169
and they go back to the hard work at the
chips that make it make it right there

435
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:53,100
and I could had some chips for paddles
and the golden software right the

436
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,940
routines

437
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,279
and put it into the basic as well so I
have huge advantages jumping over the

438
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:58,889
whole

439
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:02,720
machine in getting anything done very
easily and not quickly

440
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,080
arm wanna I wanted this computer the
Apple to

441
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,009
to be able to play games like arcade
games don't know why I design break out

442
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:10,429
right

443
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:15,169
at the park I wanted design the
possibility could do programa on a

444
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:17,299
computer microprocessor

445
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:21,418
somewhere along the lines I bought I
wonder if you could program a game we

446
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,309
also need a graphics unit

447
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:26,340
big solid color blocks on the screenplay
breakout

448
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,830
smaller ones for high-res this just
designed those in with

449
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:34,490
games in mind totally I thought I wonder
if you could program a game like

450
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,509
breakout

451
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:38,639
in base basic is a much lower language

452
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:41,740
base it sees a commander says added 12
the

453
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,730
so the number of dollars and it goes
through hundreds and even thousands a

454
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,340
little microprocessor statement

455
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,059
to do that simple little function
because it's what's called an

456
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,379
interpreted language

457
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:54,659
it analyzes your statements line by line
and goes out on

458
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,000
runs a program to get them done so so
the basic was

459
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,049
gonna be too slow for games or not

460
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:06,330
and it on this was gonna make computers
so human and give them a new view

461
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,289
i sat down one day and added the
commands to my basic for color

462
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,649
and then i sat down my little apartment
Cupertino where had been a big huge

463
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:14,830
boxes for

464
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,029
my spec my slain on the floors and Swire
sneaked into the home TV and you know

465
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:24,330
not the whole beekeeper chin i sat down
and I decided to write a little basic

466
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,949
steps now that I had enough hardware
software to

467
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:30,919
draw a line a bricks okay real easy for
loop in basic

468
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,190
and rock 812 bricks make an alternate
colors

469
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,440
and decide if we're gonna be space
differently you're next to each other

470
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,679
change a couple little for loop commands
and you know what I don't like the

471
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:41,269
colors

472
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:44,730
yellow and brown didn't work out let me
try blue and green

473
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,460
let me try blue and red your I'm sorry
martinis don't always look that good

474
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,649
with them the few color choices when you
only have

475
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,279
like eight colors but a sixteen powers
I'm so I took a little while like

476
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,519
three minutes to go through about you
know thirty variations and get some nice

477
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,210
colors &

478
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,960
I like the most and then program a
paddle in basic

479
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,340
and make it slide up and down according
to your pot command

480
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,230
that you turn in basic and then program
a ball that goes in bounces with certain

481
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,980
angles and reflects correctly in

482
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,059
D but the program a little you wind up
with a basic programs

483
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:19,200
only about 20 lines long and it's the
whole game that would normally take

484
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,480
three-man months in developing hard work

485
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,559
and I played with hundreds of variations
of it

486
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,779
and those hundreds variations were taken
my entire life

487
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:32,230
to do and hard work I called Steve Jobs
over sat down next to me on the floor

488
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,700
and I was almost shaking progressive oh
my god you gotta see this

489
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,019
now that games our software the world's
gonna change never be the same

490
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:43,480
that was a great day now at one point I
went on the hunt for Computer Club where

491
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,629
course I gave everything out talk about
my

492
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:49,169
and demonstrated my project and there
was my friend john draper

493
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:53,190
Captain Crunch well I thought you know
this will be great the first time I'm

494
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,320
gonna show off

495
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,220
areas back there somewhere John so I
thought I'd show off my

496
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,559
on he doesn't know the story either but
he was a victim

497
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,220
I I thought I'd show up my breakout game
playing on my Apple too little bore

498
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,470
little tiny board about 30 chips or
twenty chips on itttt

499
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,840
on was I use them liked impress people
now I had

500
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,970
a collared game on a machine not just
some color demos

501
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,830
and this was gonna like theoretically
blow people away in the first demo

502
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,610
product demos

503
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,960
the Homebrew Computer Club white little
sneaky thing in this program

504
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,749
if you type controls Z it would go into
a mode

505
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:31,230
where the pathological the little but
always wind up with the ball

506
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,269
never mister so I got john draper

507
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:37,590
would never played arcade games in his
life I don't think

508
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,080
on the spot trying to her hit a ball
with the paddle

509
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,080
and I and I could control Z and where
every turn the pot right or wrong

510
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,279
direction to seem to jingle little

511
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,779
to follow to take him out but it would
always get the ball

512
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:54,029
and he will everybody watched the John
playing this game is about faster and

513
00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:54,779
faster

514
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,249
for about 10 minutes anyone happen

515
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:04,809
a style

516
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,928
okay okay that's that's probably enough
for now so I'm

517
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:11,140
you know pasa back okay also

518
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,700
his life device only about

519
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,350
awesome either I actually just a few
slides total that the future and the

520
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,399
past a computing

521
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,169
arm the replica one some of you may or
may not be familiar with

522
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:29,169
is a functional after one clones have
you spent a ten or twenty or fifty grand

523
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:30,990
pineapple on the you're fortunate enough
to

524
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,350
chain arm p5 her to have them some
hundreds here term on

525
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,679
gonna pop capacitor don't wanna rely on
it wrong

526
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:43,159
our mental are behind last well man
mister brill

527
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,200
has replicated basically an apple one
Prien 98 99 percent after it won from

528
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,130
what I understand i'm dumb Hansel yet

529
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,380
and you throw yourself on there in
modern power supply

530
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,659
a modern keyboard you've got an apple
wanna play with I think this sort of

531
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:59,440
thing is a wonderful device going
towards the future the past

532
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,950
computing actually it's a real good
retro one because it even have the same

533
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,899
oddball connectors for connecting 8
wires to a keyboard and

534
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:11,730
on the way it connects to the monitor
into the to the Transformers so

535
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,980
it was really kinda true and I moved up

536
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,809
up

537
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,678
I believe it's got mmm the rocket I'm
probably wrong I believe

538
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,760
actually if I could I'd just one should
I get to my material online questions at

539
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,309
the end

540
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:31,049
by I what time arm I wanna talk with you
about

541
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:35,309
emulators Apple two systems and software
are you gonna virtual Apple dot com the

542
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:37,970
inevitable your own software its online
java

543
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,470
got hundreds discs there to run any app
a softer you want virtually literally

544
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,080
virtually

545
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,720
arm Apple when I'm a show you a Dell
here about 10 my notebook

546
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,200
are mostly to a very brief distributed
emulated multiple Apple to processing

547
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,649
demo

548
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:57,950
the multiple Apple to Zack and
cooperatively and

549
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,860
all soldiers Apple CEO for Pocket PCs
I've got about

550
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,480
sixty discs for the Apple software
running on my pack

551
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,789
so I'm not running many Sumler I'm
playing Apple adventure and Apple track

552
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:14,480
are also if you ever want to I know your
boss when you want to spread sheet no

553
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,399
one delivered to him

554
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:22,399
in two min visit shock a this will be my
just reprocessing demo

555
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,090
are the first step is an initialization
hoping a text file

556
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,940
Ivan any given emulated system open
right

557
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,559
put out a zero into a text file close it
out that's a number

558
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,010
when doing is set up the thread
calculation

559
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,510
-ism opening this file called data I'm
reading a number in this case starting

560
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,260
at zero

561
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,750
I'm closing I'm opening it for right
adding one in closing it

562
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:53,240
I'm using timing I'm starting each
Apple's boot a few seconds apart

563
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,549
and I have delay loop she could have n
processors

564
00:30:56,549 --> 00:30:59,950
as long as you avoid a race condition by
saying a possible timing interval

565
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,970
each one's going to read Andrey
independently adding to an increment

566
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,309
this is a proof of concept to base a
case he would do it for simple problem

567
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:10,899
for complex problem that would be faster
than one apple

568
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:14,190
and again have to work if you do this on
actual hardware

569
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,240
you need an interconnected bus any
mutually exclusive exclusion solution

570
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,950
but I'll show you this is working so
simple and basic

571
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:29,049
yeah om them were discussed the Apple
cat and really wanna questions

572
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:33,418
om actually Apple catches for natalie
this application I'll

573
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,990
a number you may know the Apple cat was
a wonderful little device

574
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,549
I was really awesome the options some
the standards of three yet you could

575
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:41,679
dial multi-frequency

576
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,860
touchstones render busy signals rings
dial tones howlers

577
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:50,799
arm some other friends up you might be
familiar with the PayPal nickel sounds

578
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,080
time corder are having mister the Apple
to the payphone

579
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,649
arm with cheese boxing Emily pay phone
in your home

580
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,950
trip a switch in really confuse them are

581
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,070
there was ron could program it's
recognized touchdowns

582
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,200
big blue tones teleconferencing signals

583
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,590
up very easily programmable and Dom

584
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,950
unfortunately I will say that if we buy
one those little

585
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,960
phone cards now down eight
hundred-number them printed out 50

586
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,610
digits are under digits before you can
dial your number

587
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,169
well these to be five digit codes and
you a few people on the AppleCare till

588
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:29,500
start getting off by a digit access con
for phone networks

589
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,879
okay outdueled history processing demo

590
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:41,879
gonna questions

591
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,580
camera bring up the Apple emulator

592
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,740
me

593
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:57,580
faster while right actually

594
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,580
and dissolving the onlines you have the
links for all this material

595
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,230
I'm rebooting my Apple morning program
called 0

596
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,860
I'm running does your data file

597
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,760
now mckree that's in print Apple one

598
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,629
now will bring up another Obama called
aperture morning up

599
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:28,340
my demo and wasn't there that that
process arsenide

600
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,150
system setting as another processors

601
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:39,570
another app assist at another Apple
systems or come sister

602
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,110
problem I'm a pop-up one more just for
good measure now for

603
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,030
every time a rake not have any race
conditions will be stepping on each

604
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:51,770
other

605
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:57,610
and they're all working with one shared
file gambling that Apple

606
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,620
I'm moving that Apple I'm moving that
Apple

607
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,000
and I'm putting this out that took a
long time

608
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,690
half a second and now they're running at
the real time original Apple

609
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,159
the one who runs a hundred frames a
second and I've got

610
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,970
for Apple's each counting independently
on the same

611
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,679
dataset yup

612
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,610
that scenes in the first series second
series

613
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:31,610
third series and fourth series on lunch
in simulated drive 123 456 789 10

614
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:40,429
no race condition 10 okay it happens I
did a little faster live

615
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:43,940
if I time if I counted 23 between doing
each one you can avoid

616
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,520
races ok you're having a reason cycles
but powerful concept and

617
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,610
a little one race condition I run

618
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:56,050
I I think I'm not gonna do this again
drones time for questions

619
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,030
but because everyone wants to play with
it things may be put on one questions

620
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,610
and please use microphone

621
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:06,620
centers alert when it was actually if
arm

622
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:13,620
is likely wrap our this just one second

623
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,790
okay

624
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:28,380
I had source

625
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,250
okay move on a question basically are I
have to wake up there

626
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,750
are you could take Apple disks which urs
tinner format for PC

627
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,100
platforms now you load up about as many
as you want on any these devices

628
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,630
walking to the Apple eventually games
and if you do call me

629
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,970
151 drop rate to machine language

630
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,120
you can go to the integer basic into an
app 666 go

631
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,130
and your December many summers while are

632
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,280
if this gets going live will kick in
last few minutes

633
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,210
those for the AIPAC the

634
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:08,340
your Pocket PC

635
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:15,340
have got a better partner than an hour
Dutch his

636
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,040
does russians this question is risky

637
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,040
and your participation in vocal support
for the individual contributor in

638
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,880
technology in

639
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,680
individuals pursuing curiosity and have
an opportunity to participate not just

640
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,060
urs

641
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,290
members have a large corporation ur
legendary

642
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,759
I think the the hacker in computer
community in general osha huge

643
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,440
thanks for that thanks yeah in general
you know it's been

644
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,070
so deep in in my soul mark to lose your
values

645
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,710
as you go through even businesses and
I'm very proud also when

646
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,900
evert subject comes up I'm not really
major working real hard

647
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,630
on issues and political things and that
kinda work but I'm so proud of having

648
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,420
been one of the funders founders

649
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:11,420
regional board members of the affair
home are given and I

650
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,569
just there's just a water right and
wrong hands you know hard to deal with

651
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,538
I'm

652
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,329
I wonder if you could offers a little
perspective from that obvious position

653
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:28,609
as to the legacy /url love Apple is a
corporation's policy

654
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,730
love closed hardware and software in
specifically

655
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,619
the separation of the development tools
from the Apple OS environment from the

656
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:37,910
package typically so

657
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,799
delivered to the end-user the
development tools are separate very

658
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:42,730
expensive

659
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,319
too much einon in there until the recent

660
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:51,049
integration of the BSD derived colonel
with Mac OS 10

661
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:54,720
are there were no third-party
development tools whatsoever available

662
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,339
for the Apple environment good good you

663
00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:01,279
how did that evolve in in in an
alternately maybe you could speak to

664
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,670
sum up the litigation were Apple has
sued smaller

665
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,750
dog defendants under the DMCA get I

666
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,720
can't refer to the latter question but
I'm is not knowledgeable really

667
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,849
I'm don't have a strong opinion I but

668
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,130
you know the Apple started out with this
open computer

669
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,029
work everything I had learned was really
from openers up reading other computer

670
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:24,900
manuals rem

671
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,230
other people's programs been able to
learn on my own and

672
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,519
our president Mike Scott myself tried to
expound that and make

673
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,180
everything possible for other people to
a tagine and design their own

674
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,279
could great things for the Apple to end
it with every year it was just blew me

675
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:40,420
away what kinda party

676
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,720
reports they'd come up with them well
kinda programs so it was really a fee

677
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,440
a spear hoping this and Steve Jobs right
from the start

678
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,069
kinda wanna close system and Michael
back to little personal things like we

679
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:53,970
had an argument over how many boards

680
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,119
should be in the Apple to he wanted two
words all you need is a promoter

681
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:01,450
what you define your product and that's
it and it stays that way forever

682
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,680
i doing wrong computers my home I people
plug offer to things in you'd never

683
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,450
think government what what the board's

684
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,490
and I fought him on that by didn't
really fight him for the

685
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,839
for the the right reason which is you
wanna leave a lot of openness in space

686
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:14,710
for people it's been a

687
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,779
I really personally I have designed this
clever circuit the decoder

688
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:22,119
all eight boards with one chip in
Auburn's a second serve members is with

689
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:22,750
another chip

690
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,809
and I'd save about forty chips you have
to put into it the inside way with

691
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:30,269
toggle switches for addresses and all
that I'm so proud of my little

692
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:33,910
design the same so many chips I wouldn't
give it up we got under two slots

693
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:38,879
and get as much credit as if we have a
truth for that in internally so I'm

694
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,289
it was kinda funny but I was always
interpret the oldest open its cuz I saw

695
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:43,309
all these companies

696
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:46,819
that we're like a family and community
all these people were taken to

697
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:50,269
ads for the Apple to win the worst part
of us and they were with us

698
00:39:50,269 --> 00:39:53,920
but there was a lot in front in the
company to nope kinda always control

699
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,750
everything in

700
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,160
get as much from the software and
whatever locked up to where we got the

701
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,640
profits from it and by about the

702
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,410
eighties arm around the time john scali
came in

703
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,700
mom boy all the Apple executive team was
pretty solidly against

704
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,720
clones against having hard what you know
I felt that

705
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,390
our biggest assets were software but the
hardware be any work

706
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,879
as Microsoft model was startin work so
well on

707
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,900
but yeah they were pretty much for
keeping things as close as possible and

708
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,670
proprietary in that was the success

709
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,809
the road to the greatest profits not
maybe Apple is such an incredibly

710
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:30,900
successful company can't put that down

711
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,480
Apple has the most incredible leadership
products and

712
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,920
really taking the masses into the newer
technologies

713
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,690
they're doing a better job than anyone
else little more expensive by

714
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,809
on so it's so I can come up with an
answer what's is our right or wrong

715
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:49,619
I was just order the come along pretty
good I guess I'll

716
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,930
furnace wondering what your perspective
was through that experience and and

717
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,609
maybe do you have any comments regarding
the reason for you

718
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:58,970
where many it was their political switch
within the structure the corporation

719
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,650
recently

720
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:03,750
that led to the adoption well Darwin in
the B is the drive colonel in the

721
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,230
porting

722
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,849
X to the Apple desktop in there's

723
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:12,480
there's it's too complicated the
situation as the Apple buying next from

724
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,420
Steve Jobs and all that died I don't
think I think it's gonna waste the money

725
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,099
but it wasn't enough money to really

726
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:22,519
Mattern announced now looking back it's
we gotta such a great operating system

727
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,549
I'm glad that they're

728
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:27,538
purchase happened even whatever
high-price arm

729
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:30,940
you know I just I think that

730
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,940
our there was a a lawsuit against
Microsoft

731
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,150
anti-trust it was called what is

732
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,970
any trust well it's you know you got a
monopoly position

733
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:45,190
and you decide news for monopoly to
gather other markets let's say you had

734
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,089
all the gas stations in the United
States

735
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,538
is that i'm gonna start building a car
company and change the gas stations to

736
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:52,119
only work with my cars

737
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:55,480
general motors your business for your
business that's that's where the

738
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,539
anti-trust is

739
00:41:56,539 --> 00:42:00,279
is a writers are wrong is there a chance
that you cross over and you're the bad

740
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:00,740
guy

741
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,849
are you the good innovator Microsoft
every single thing in the world

742
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:08,140
across FM for one thing the company
could have done more than they did

743
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,779
in the case of what browser I'm Internet
Explorer soul

744
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,819
they're pretty guilty but if you read
the fine the fact that the fines

745
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:18,058
why they are a monopoly even though
there are companies like Apple

746
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:21,109
what actually if you really look at it
closely Apple's a monopoly

747
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:24,210
people know what kinda computer that on
a bike now when you're using

748
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:27,430
you can go back and buy american you
know if your Mac person or a PC person

749
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:31,020
and really it's not a competition we got
the same store compare 'em

750
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,538
side by side it's not that way some
really apples a motley because they have

751
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:36,259
a low market share the getaway with

752
00:42:36,259 --> 00:42:39,319
not being accused of anti-trust Apple
was just

753
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:42,400
music program it's apples you know
they're all great there have to be on

754
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,250
it's a great world when you have a kind
of like a real good dictator

755
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,240
you know that does good things for you
to open up the great music permits ours

756
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,650
the video programs are zero the overall
the software that you really need

757
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,980
you kind of get from Apple and other
little third parties

758
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,099
arm lost a lot of ability to succeed
there well

759
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:02,700
I think they were lucky to have you as I
very high profile

760
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,509
as a wealthy in a successful high-tech
businessman

761
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:09,579
to represent the position of openness
among

762
00:43:09,579 --> 00:43:13,319
your peers is CT owes in CEO's a

763
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:16,950
expensive corporations because I don't
want multi-party

764
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,520
there aren't many well I think appeared
most I hear you are

765
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,309
but %um many more questions but I

766
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:27,869
I gave his time with a true
representation for open

767
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:31,140
open source okay and a while next
questions being asked to outdo

768
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,098
I'll take the liberty Obama booting up
by Apple adventures well

769
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:38,589
mind that echo please I'll which
question please Stephen

770
00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:42,200
real quick question for you what have
you learned from the kids

771
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,520
I I'm I don't think

772
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,220
I don't know how many times the its
funny if I take a fourth grader and

773
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,509
start teaching computers to them

774
00:43:50,509 --> 00:43:53,880
what back when I was good I mean
nowadays kids are always so for him it's

775
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,039
gonna be fun

776
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,390
copper also their purses I understood
everything to tell you to fix this and

777
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:58,990
that

778
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:01,410
and I will teach the kids an answer
their questions when their fourth

779
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,558
graders but I'm their fifth graders

780
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,259
half the time %ah be scratching my head
about something in front of a kid not so

781
00:44:07,259 --> 00:44:09,069
here's how you do it

782
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:13,690
so I learned a lot of you know love the
little all the little

783
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:17,680
small things that are in any computer
shortcuts the ways to do things that you

784
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,009
can't know the mall there's

785
00:44:19,009 --> 00:44:22,589
10,000 up how can one my normal so they
were sharper than me in a lot of those

786
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:23,319
areas

787
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:26,599
but I don't like all that burning that
was really more obviously

788
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:29,829
a feeling a feeling of wonderment
whenever they learn something

789
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:33,230
and guards oh my god that's incredible
you can do that

790
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,480
that's that's the best for the future
could ever have the teachers

791
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,520
is really rewarded when the kids learn
and when you have a day in

792
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,038
class and they didn't seem to get it
those were my worst days like go home

793
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,789
and I'd be in a brown mood and I think
about it but I was so lucky I was in

794
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:49,119
part a school district ahead of schedule
you have to teach

795
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,759
on certain days and go on to the next
subject I can go back and do tackle the

796
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:54,460
same subject if I fail

797
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,890
because thy you know as a teacher didn't
you don't want to fail

798
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,538
with with the child you wanna you want
to get every single one that's the right

799
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:01,769
way

800
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:08,599
thank you thanks for choosing the 6502
and nearly 60,000 Monroe series with

801
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:12,150
wanted to throw the bum over the Intel
series Archer the Intel

802
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,440
was had no way to buy it like as a
normal person it was a four hundred

803
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:15,839
dollar

804
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,078
ship I didn't have the money I found out
as an actual packard employees could buy

805
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,269
a motorola trip for

806
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:24,819
the 640,000 City 104

807
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:28,910
forty dollars and them MI most
technology introduced this

808
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,009
microprocessor

809
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:33,779
the 6502 with a lotta have dressing
additions

810
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:37,339
am fewer instructions what I had come
from a background

811
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:41,880
really appreciating after scene modes to
the max the IBM 360 was like the dream

812
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,019
machine my wife

813
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:46,440
because the way that every instruction
use a reference and urs Watson of

814
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:46,980
certain

815
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,239
I love that kinda thing so I I really
thought this was the best processor

816
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,599
going and it was set to private universe
owner for 20 bucks

817
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,589
but you can actually bring a twenty
dollar bill one by one you didn't have

818
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:59,520
to have all these credits forms from a
company in all this stuff

819
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,529
there were no way to buy microprocessors
back them or any real any chips really

820
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:08,029
electronic stores just had transistors
so it was sold in a good way a bunch was

821
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:09,880
from the Homebrew Computer Club went to
its

822
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,950
a an event in San Francisco bought our
own microprocessor chips and

823
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,700
and boy it was a there was a big
marketing

824
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,160
arm incredible success really if you
look at how many

825
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,180
embedded processors around the world now
are 6502 based

826
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,710
ones that grew up with times other
companies I just unbelievable

827
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:32,130
wanna be your man they're all good

828
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,599
on speaking it even easier hardwares
truces quick opinion poll

829
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,829
RT Razvi your city trashy rices color 64

830
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,009
which one you like afternoon consular I

831
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:45,329
honorable well I'm

832
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:48,700
came from the Intel environment so I the
Treasury

833
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,140
that I still to this day termite

834
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,589
credited my

835
00:46:55,589 --> 00:47:01,279
one when everything else my life breaks
down I throw in four II's Nike bygone

836
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:05,489
however a good example of a closed
system like the Commodore PET versus

837
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,500
Apple's open system that can actually
spend two enough memory for a floppy

838
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:08,960
disk

839
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,569
or enough memory for biz account I i
personally

840
00:47:12,569 --> 00:47:16,700
like the tears any model one which was
nice early 1i like it was a very

841
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:21,469
basic machine no pun intended arm I like
cocoa the color computer

842
00:47:21,469 --> 00:47:26,210
but after that I pretty much go Apple to
and actually for the big time family

843
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,770
system 370

844
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:31,509
arm it's always fun to drop some losses
data cards but that

845
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:35,279
to actually we only have about four
minutes left size teacher

846
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:38,650
each one has appeared may be coming from
one to two minutes on something I've

847
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,239
interests

848
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:42,410
and also Cheshire Police

849
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:46,538
arms well I I need to plug my little
hyper book club

850
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:50,259
of course their secrets there in the
manual which are

851
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:54,119
my various exploits over the years arm
including my

852
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:58,500
I'll week in homestead florida after
hurricane andrew is a ham operator

853
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,960
are some other interesting sidelight
circles rose by Captain Crunch

854
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,839
are phone freaking Mike Mike Alex
exploits others bill for fifteen dollars

855
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,799
now the dusters registration area

856
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:11,869
all later in the afternoon arm

857
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:15,420
all I can say is what I've learned over
the years is tough I picked up from

858
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,819
reading manuals from talk with people

859
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:22,538
art from exploring and keep your mind
open for exploring

860
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:26,829
thank you thank you

861
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:30,059
well from

862
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:33,170
those yeah for me out there man

863
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:36,529
I'd love to go back and get back in the
Apple to spring had time for one more

864
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:38,450
thing they have in my life because I
read

865
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:42,109
run emails from friends that do that may
have the greatest time in their life

866
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:42,940
gone back to the

867
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,500
govern what that world was it how do you
recreate it when people do for

868
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,119
electronics today have a hooker on trips
together in

869
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,299
their garage right from little programs
and it's so hard to come up with the

870
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:57,089
answers that work but I think that might
happen in the near future with robotics

871
00:48:57,089 --> 00:49:00,788
the motors the parts the technology the
understanding the number people that are

872
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:03,109
interested in the quality of the
advanced robots with artificial

873
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:04,558
intelligence

874
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,969
is so great I think that even from
schools on up that's got a potential to

875
00:49:07,969 --> 00:49:08,819
be the next

876
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:12,700
home erector set where you build your
own things to get to really work on

877
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,779
the robots are coming in my only other
advice would be

878
00:49:15,779 --> 00:49:22,119
back up your hard disk and I'm I think

879
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:26,059
why I think I'd like to comment on arm
is for me one thing that really drove me

880
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:27,180
into security

881
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,440
long-term was when I was working Apple
tombs

882
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,819
arm it was just the flexibility in the
machine language is that

883
00:49:33,819 --> 00:49:37,299
you're capable surface key nothin rich
enough you could have this protection

884
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:38,288
systems

885
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:41,770
any the analyze them and break to my
favorites single disc problems

886
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,819
captain copies copy programs desk with a
series track enders

887
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:49,140
this free typing the name in the system
and you could point parameters you can

888
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:53,049
figure out where people put date in on
the half track with a modified the d5 a

889
00:49:53,049 --> 00:49:54,940
96 headers defy the

890
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:58,480
DB up and bring back some memories but
that was

891
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,630
for me the url Israel hacking that I can
remember and work with an

892
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,819
anyone could do it could be 12 years old
in doing intellectually rewarding hack

893
00:50:06,819 --> 00:50:10,038
bien have a software system what the
computer clubs all

894
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:13,950
everybody showed up with boxes for apps
floppy disks every game in the world

895
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,529
than ever useful program they wanted
their copy other

896
00:50:16,529 --> 00:50:19,559
and they have a copy others and figure
out how to do it I think we increase

897
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,849
intelligence in the world so greatly
that

898
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:26,339
repaid up the concept is share the
knowledge
