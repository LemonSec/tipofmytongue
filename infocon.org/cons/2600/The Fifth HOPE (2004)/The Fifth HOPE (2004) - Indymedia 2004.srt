1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,219
session right now is in the median 2004

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,450
before the beginning a couple
announcements to make first follow

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,110
it's probably going to be but

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,580
we're not sure yet but there will
probably be a remote the

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,910
to the video room on the second floor
for Joe BR for later

6
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,560
more on that later Area C has a
concurrent speaker schedule

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,090
going on right now it's scavenger hunt
RNC 1 o'clock you're packing the iPod

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,590
to why forensics sucks 3 Python

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,030
in the TCP IP stack for media streaming

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,629
so at the schedules every denouncing

11
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:42,190
just did and that's it

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:49,190
right now like changes in the million
2004 in

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,640
well

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,340
I ever on are so this is the

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,750
the panel on media the independent media
centers

16
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,240
all around the world and we have the
yeah

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,140
hey there I'll so my name is Mike I work

18
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,920
in addition to the independent media
centers where I work

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,820
largely on local tech issues I also work
with prices in a magazine

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,030
and when I

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,880
give a talk here about in the media and
some other stuff for planning

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,220
for the democratic and republican
conventions

23
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,250
and just you know what else were up to

24
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,149
my name is Lee

25
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:41,160
I am awesome

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,039
to work with global any media taxes
admin stuff

27
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:49,350
on and and how so work

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,479
million tons in Chicago marks now doing
the same

29
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,460
independent media suck

30
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,739
my name is a room

31
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,160
I work with the New York City
independent media centers specifically

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,450
its print project

33
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,949
work with a lot of other media
organizations around the city

34
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,950
and I'm working

35
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,190
with a bunch of different groups to most
independent media convergence under

36
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:22,329
during the conventional talk a little
about that so I'm

37
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,099
advanced first side since what is in the
media

38
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,049
say agassi

39
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,470
in in general it's a to global network
for

40
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,300
produces journals organizers and
technicians any ideas

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,720
that the media you can take it into your
own hands

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,720
and I guess is

43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,319
started centered around the internet im

44
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,220
1999 Seattle kinda for

45
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,830
from I never actually taxing individuals
involved

46
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,940
on have heard this many times turn
together at the last minute

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,740
like a this internet message word
content management thing

48
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,300
and you know it might be a good idea to
use it

49
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,170
for this big nigga protest and

50
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,010
Spina like like exponentially from there

51
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,060
and now there over 100

52
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,890
grasses collectives spending

53
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:33,310
6 continents says tennis amazing every
time I think about it I'm

54
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,580
there's a there's there's a lot of
involvement in

55
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,370
especially in South America Europe and

56
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,830
and North America there's also

57
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,520
there's upon Africa in Asia that

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,270
obviously there's a stronger language
barrier their for

59
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,970
Americans English

60
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:04,970
speakers so personally much

61
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,849
yes a.m. the whole composition at the
global networks rather fascinating Isley

62
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,780
said it started

63
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,539
I it was set up prior to the WT a
ministerial in Seattle

64
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:20,880
in 1999 and everybody kind of knows
about what happened there

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,110
the street protests love the violence

66
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,210
days a running battle but really what
what made Seattle Seattle was

67
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,440
in the media because people could really
bypass the corporate media

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,020
on a mass scale the open publishing our
software

69
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,870
allowed individuals to post all sorts of
contents directly to the newswire

70
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,250
arm whether that was audio/video so did

71
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,560
photos reports from the streets and

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,900
I think it was getting about five
million hits today it was beating all

73
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,940
the corporate networks and this was done
for free with

74
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,289
both freeware on just to a whole
volunteer network

75
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:03,930
they've had very little money operated
just spawned in

76
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,699
enormous response because people didn't

77
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,780
really have to rely on the corporate
bullshit

78
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,229
on anymore and they could really see
what was going on and

79
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,080
evaluate for themselves and that kinda
had this

80
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,550
I exponential effect both

81
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,240
in North America and around the world
and one of the interesting things is

82
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,870
wary in the media's tend to be
concentrated

83
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,680
there's something about like 50 in the
US alone so

84
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,720
maybe about forty percent of the global
network just resides

85
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,680
within the the US and then it's very
active in Europe and Latin America

86
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,539
basically where they're strong social
movements

87
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:47,199
you'll find in the media but there's
also a lot of barriers to technology

88
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,220
obviously in much of the

89
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,210
world the third world so like Africa
there's very few

90
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,159
in the media centers on is southern
Africa and I think Nigeria

91
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:02,110
and maybe some place in West Africa is
about it but most the continent they

92
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,750
don't have the

93
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,250
resources there was a conga Livesey for
a little while

94
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,870
they had like one computer and it broke
and

95
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,039
did there's just all these issues with
technology resources capital

96
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,070
like say the New York Independent Media
Center we

97
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,849
we go through maybe like ten thousand
dollars a month in terms of revenue and

98
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:22,710
expenses

99
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,659
in the third world country someplace
like bolivia might be a hundred dollars

100
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:27,610
a year

101
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,159
and they might have one computer that
everybody has to take turns on

102
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:37,090
so a lot of what we tried to do is
technology transfer

103
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,169
get computers and into the third world I
help

104
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:45,000
help them with funding and and to be
able to set it up but it is a real

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,130
barrier just as

106
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,469
is the language barrier also and you
also find that in regions where you have

107
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,729
a

108
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,000
repressive governments there are no in
the media's at all

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,630
like there's not one single in the media
in China whereas

110
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,229
there now I take at least three India
but again it's a reflection

111
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:08,229
both a strong social movements and
access to technology

112
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,870
al band and lastly in the media is you

113
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:21,550
pic cell

114
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,910
house Postmedia distributed cuz

115
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,040
its for me it's a

116
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,550
media as as like a name concept

117
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:37,080
isn't really anyone think just because
it's a decentralized

118
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,500
nature was explaining its

119
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,740
it's kinda hard to really put your
finger on the quad is

120
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,080
with doing that for me the most valuable

121
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,640
what's the most valuable for is a
distribution network

122
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,200
and I was showing that the global and
media website

123
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,520
on projector and that's just one

124
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,840
a hundred now so far similar format a.m.

125
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,590
ameri ichinose but there's open
publishing page

126
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,150
an its Agosto Suffolk leanna

127
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,400
a lotta started out as unmoderated

128
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,620
an unmoderated farm I'm you can imagine
attack

129
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,380
kassin problems over time there's a lot
of people that don't really agree with

130
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,070
messages very intent on

131
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,909
explaining so a lot of a lotta

132
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,150
policy kinda decisions when into that

133
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,348
on local in-season cells but nonetheless

134
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,470
and that's the main distribution fund
distribution is

135
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,920
the web and text and photos said the
simplest

136
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,180
to publish and can some

137
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,270
some sites can accept audio and video
but

138
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,579
its that again is usually dependent on
the local

139
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,130
tech collective and how much

140
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,650
storage how much they're willing to a to
work

141
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,420
Brussels a resource sharing among

142
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,990
global networks I'll web postings

143
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,540
some locals very expensive in New York's
were also very expensive that weekend

144
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,079
maybe

145
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,470
find some as a server all those put in
their basement

146
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,700
and sure those resources so that we can

147
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,730
you know attempt to distribute
audio/video photographs

148
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,410
throughout the web

149
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,060
fairly cheaply as cheaply as we
committed course web video

150
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,200
jus the technology really isn't there
yet so much

151
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,600
read it is like that a postage stamp
size things om

152
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,160
the sleepy one is free suffer to do it
so

153
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,589
you know but we try I'm have variety of
distribution methods

154
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:49,709
room just some copies of the paper may
be with you I'm

155
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:54,329
the back so if you look in the back a
the independent which is

156
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,300
New York City our folks are working

157
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,380
on this newspaper that comes out every
two weeks now

158
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,110
and so there's to provide access to
people may not have the Webmin

159
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,399
no to go in the media services time
variety distribution month

160
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,779
I think use really not just the webcam

161
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,420
the next yr

162
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,449
item siders newsprint to the collectors
maybe

163
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:25,600
I service led up to that you could near

164
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,649
a.m. I like that says specifically work
on

165
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:33,120
the newspaper and both for a variety of
reasons

166
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,240
we do publish a lot of stuff on on the
web obviously the web has

167
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,690
both an immediacy and reach and a
cost-effectiveness

168
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,820
I that newsprint dozen year every single
sheet of newspaper 'cause something the

169
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,800
web one chapter

170
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,070
technology its relatively inexpensive
you can usually

171
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,690
rely on volunteer labor that's been
mixed bag like we've had a lot of

172
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,410
success

173
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,800
but at the same time we have difficulty
like updating our website sir kind

174
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,350
changer code newsprint I'm it costs a
lot of money

175
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,100
we have a monthly printing bill about 25
hundred dollars to

176
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,620
by we produce about thirty to forty
thousand copies of the paper

177
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,940
and distributed but the fact of the
matter is that they're still

178
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,300
even I within New York City plenty of
people

179
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,350
don't have access to the web and
personally also

180
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,459
my opinion did newsprint has a
permanency

181
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,980
that you can't replicate on the web that
it does tend to get taken more seriously

182
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,519
because a lot more energy goes into it

183
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,399
anyone can post something on to the web
it's a lot more difficult to publish

184
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:40,880
your own

185
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,730
newspaper to go through all the editing
the fact checking the research that too

186
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,760
distributed out there and to get it
taken seriously

187
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,250
and so I think there is an inherent bias

188
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,930
in terms of readers two words trusting
something morning newspaper that on the

189
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,339
web it doesn't say that the content is
any better or worse but

190
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,410
I think that's kind of the way you know
we we perceive things

191
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,310
as consumers and news little

192
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,199
I dare as as oskar say there's all sorts
of print projects that are

193
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,699
going on throughout the world on though
the tend to be

194
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:21,390
concentrated in countries where you can
get access to the resources

195
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,540
on third world countries are more
successful

196
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,890
with the web sites because even in

197
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,529
you know what places like the Andean
regions people can still

198
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,750
access internet cafes whereas for them
to

199
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,300
produce a newspaper cause a helluva lot
more money and

200
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,430
it could take up their yearly budget
just to do one issue

201
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,730
I'm so in the US

202
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,140
and I think in europe you find like a
fair number newspaper

203
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:55,140
projects but I'm not so much in the rest
of the world

204
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,050
seller an the next distribution points
video

205
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,680
through public access television

206
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,190
mail-order and bit torrent and

207
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,730
that work on I think videos probably as
far as distributions

208
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,170
one of the biggest technical challenges
because you're moving

209
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,510
there's so many different digital videos
complicated faces person the different

210
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,890
codecs and formats and and ways to do it

211
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,510
edited whatever and then just disturbing

212
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,740
requires a certain amount of certain
those

213
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,050
come denominator resources which is
still kinda hi

214
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:38,030
here if you're thinking globally I'm
personally when the things that I

215
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,540
think I think as much promise is using
archived at work

216
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,400
as a distribution video distribution
point I have

217
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,120
as interest on partners archive direct
marketing hours are cut their

218
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,850
daily in a in uncompressed audio format
which is kinda unbelievable

219
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,600
just invited me to a ploy to see her
neck batwing file every day

220
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm and it does of their are the
transcoding and munching

221
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,550
on the server side and it's a public
service

222
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,970
and there's they're starting to do that
her they do that with video as well

223
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,900
I'm obviously a putting uncompressed
video over the Internet is kinda

224
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,140
ridiculous on by

225
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,510
actually did get an invitation to

226
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:25,780
us put a bunch of video

227
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,000
on a flower hard disk and mail it to
them

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,280
and they said that they would archive it
and transcoded

229
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,280
and put our on for me which

230
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,069
I was kinda shocked but they seemed very
serious

231
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,730
I'm may have a every a considerable
amount a band with

232
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,860
it's not am it's not amazing thing to
have a 10-megapixel

233
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,960
action and they have seemed to have

234
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,260
a and black holes storage space

235
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,189
Angeles yeah

236
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,160
and I don't know their last time I
checked they're not using any sort of

237
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,730
p2p

238
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,400
thing on a lot on the uses her a bit I'm

239
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,750
on and other p2p tech networks are

240
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,120
kinda depending on the on the local the

241
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,140
local collective that's doing it if
people are

242
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,520
you're savvy enough to set it up into I
would assume the team's

243
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:25,520
their own tracker

244
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,500
than audio through

245
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,660
low-power FM parent radio and the web
there

246
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,160
is in the United States there there I
know

247
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,319
there's a lot where there's a couple
other

248
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,740
in the media local the media collective
said

249
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,280
are using good old FM airwaves

250
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,750
to broadcast when other more notable
ones is

251
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,140
video water in Philly on and

252
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,300
day broadcast through help me out here

253
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,490
I think it's so that they local radio
station in Philly

254
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,640
that they have some no idea 9 in

255
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,660
well got it sir think its affiliate ID
media

256
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,370
that works and

257
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,490
obviously barriers of Mercy protests to

258
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,810
another pirate is not that hard Tom and
the past year there have been just in

259
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,690
New York City

260
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,190
this three or four spanish-language
churches

261
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,570
for some reason they all the side about
the same time to stir something up our

262
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,570
radio stations and

263
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,980
and of course is on the arrest there but
it's really technically not that

264
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,010
difficult to settle

265
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,490
are radio station there's a ban on on
Friday

266
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,959
and just you sharp writings and then
there's the web

267
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,339
which is as we know global medium

268
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:04,130
on and their is I'm

269
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,610
I'm there's a pearl

270
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,070
and nice Cassar

271
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,669
available and then where and its on

272
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,830
a global radio list and lot of people

273
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,649
especially in Europe and South America
are using to broadcast

274
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,390
their local radio shows in ninety-three
NOC format

275
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,060
and there is also a

276
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,129
radio that in the media to or bring

277
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,179
screen

278
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,080
and as a little bit less dynamic

279
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,780
as alive live stream and it's basically
a

280
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,210
when similar type of content management
system but it's a

281
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,730
specific to radio

282
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,030
and idea recordings and its yes

283
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:00,330
see there's the center column has some
pretty recent posts

284
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,678
from couple days ago so

285
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,660
it sir it's a lot to use and could slice

286
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,660
AFP reproduced clips

287
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,940
so one of the things that we do in the
news

288
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,140
founded largely on the web soul we use a
lot of Technology

289
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,380
media network are the kind o

290
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,390
yes we're going to talk a little bit
more about

291
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,400
email is bit but they're kinda the main
way

292
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,780
that in the media just run is by email

293
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,170
which is kinda

294
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,330
disturbing maybe but very effective for
communicating internationally with

295
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,090
people in different time zones and

296
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,550
much as their first language in this and
the other

297
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:50,030
and and so we use you know a variety of
technologies

298
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,670
to help us communicate but there's a lot
of opportunities for folks may be in the

299
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,460
audience or

300
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,800
folks you know to get involved within
the media

301
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,200
to start working on some other projects
that that we're talking about today

302
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,220
IOM so we have on on their

303
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,480
ringtone read it girl

304
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,600
100 I'll this is a

305
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,710
you notice stop by stop by physically
stop by

306
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,360
on the Internet and you know get
involved we

307
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,760
really would love to have people the
competencies that are

308
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,420
fountain there's also an this website at
docs

309
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,420
to immediate at work is a it's a wicked

310
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,250
and I can say that it's the

311
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,450
best-organized wiki but it is useful

312
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,130
and it has them quite a lot of
information

313
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,790
including points

314
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,020
on how to get involved with your

315
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:56,600
local tech collective

316
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,720
your basically the same issue just
previous side

317
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,340
there's a bunch introductory kind
Commission frustrated

318
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,279
you know

319
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,399
our the last witness I am there is a in
me does have its own

320
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:19,700
GPG keyser and a

321
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,580
it's a it's not like GPG signatures and
stuff like that

322
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,019
as is not use that much

323
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,210
by I found doing sis and work am

324
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,159
its incredibly valuable and because it
really is a good way to

325
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,019
develop that weapon trust and especially
if you could affect face meetings in

326
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:44,649
duty things like exchanged key
signatures in person

327
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:49,130
mister this happens rarely some time to
time

328
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,000
a good way to get com get plugged in

329
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,639
if you're into you nixon canister

330
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:03,000
so the this website's was not enough
open publishing

331
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,340
we talked a bit about where anyone can
just come in and

332
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,750
poser expenses and or whatever to our
website

333
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:14,240
a course in our so too artists mister
president software

334
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,809
there is no software to do this was is
project called

335
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:23,610
active which did it was great it was
great from the user's perspective it was

336
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,230
horrendous nightmare from the admins
perspective it wasn't it wasn't built

337
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,519
at at one time sir bill I think
collectively by

338
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,870
people all around the world over the
course of like two years

339
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,919
yeah uses only suffer ever heard of that
if you want to work you

340
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,269
must have on your server both minus no
Campos Press

341
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:47,860
it was is very on and PHP and Perl

342
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,210
yeah and as a SSI close it was a mess

343
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,669
so so a people said this is a mass and
the

344
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:57,740
some now not very many people are using
that horrible mass

345
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,759
3 kinda most popular a projects

346
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,289
to do this sort of thing now there's are
mere as a factor

347
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:09,330
and I A Amir is kind of very very slick

348
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,740
its it's a Java Servlet after publishing

349
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,080
but it actually generates stacked HTML
pages so you can hear these things you

350
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,250
can cash them you can do all the things
you can do a static HTML

351
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,679
very very efficiently throughout the web
on

352
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,679
and its is very neat the other

353
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,889
the others as affective which is a
written in PHP

354
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:34,340
and comes at a San Francisco as just buy
them

355
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,689
fairness and go

356
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,019
teams pretty its its colorful it's fun

357
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:44,480
and the militant CNN do yeah do

358
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,019
I guess is defending the CNN logo

359
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:53,730
ex-con him huh the third one which is
actually the one we use

360
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,629
here in new york is called on a IMC it
comes out of Baltimore

361
00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:01,519
there it is and yes easy installation

362
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,470
yeah does actors yeah pastimes

363
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,019
used and a local features is the
administration

364
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:13,299
Jens it's fun software and it's written
in PHP

365
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:17,330
summer the queen's PHP ever seen on

366
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,350
for free that when I edited nixon's
worse

367
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:24,090
you had to be in

368
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:31,090
excellent coder to work on it some
prerequisite

369
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,460
yes

370
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,360
whether the backwaters you know coming

371
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,170
screw things up

372
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,250
you are things happening it happens all
the time its funds and of course

373
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,750
authors offer packages are free software

374
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,770
I think they're under the GPL not

375
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,020
something I really detailed data is the
LG the LG

376
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,700
side National Library so there

377
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,350
there I'll the other offer software the
enemy movement in the free software

378
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,210
movement

379
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,140
of course a lot of goals in common and

380
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,960
Spurs sorry for us not use for sale
biggest

381
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,180
jobs but other servers generally

382
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:21,180
money Dublin beacons in a few months as
people so

383
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,950
re: some and are I'm wishin and back on
the Bruce I that there's

384
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,150
other kobe is a mystery there's a list

385
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,390
on the wiki are interested in I love
them

386
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,290
just a caveat allow them are out-of-date
and

387
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,620
just because there's a link there and it
says this in the media companies don't

388
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,600
believe it first

389
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,470
for example aims to slash it is based on
slash code them touch him

390
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,610
three years

391
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,600
so all this on systems require a lot of
work to run

392
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,499
and it's even more interesting because
love the time a few

393
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,490
running mall the time that you're
running it are in all different

394
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,190
countries

395
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,870
home because different languages a

396
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,720
so communicating this is a man I'm sure
if you've ever tried to community to

397
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,059
Hornets is a meeting with someone who is
in the same officers knew you know

398
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,158
has a look at me so a you know

399
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,940
global distribution network abuse people
have access to servers

400
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,470
even more fun but it seems to work most
the time

401
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,700
there's global text collective which is
a

402
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,019
multi-lingual course its all volunteer
base

403
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:36,100
add to that you were

404
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,640
with and on

405
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,519
most the did a texter

406
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:47,330
is done over IRC and I just found out
recently some people are saying

407
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,408
cell which think it's great I personally
don't sigh

408
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:56,000
very comment on on this year not from a
US cell

409
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,750
its secure internet live conferencing
and its

410
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,750
a key base

411
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,710
IRC kinda system and it's awesome there

412
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,710
think guarantee that I've read is that
when he send a

413
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,840
message to someone you can be almost
absolutely certain

414
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,860
are sending it that person which makes
it really confer

415
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,860
shuffling passwords back and forth

416
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:26,580
and feeling dirty about it

417
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,780
yeah having that probably the the most
difficult part

418
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,230
is is needed because it's global
everybody's

419
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,340
operating on GMT and they're all around
the world

420
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,360
and icing people's have meetings to try
and figure out

421
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,900
what time have a meeting and

422
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,320
eventually it does of all together but
sometimes

423
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,700
to commit to you know having a meeting
there

424
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,070
for you personally at three in the
morning when someone else's

425
00:26:54,070 --> 00:27:01,070
noon their know I'll awakens depend

426
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,010
what's next Alice Millar haha lobby now

427
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,720
the Sony media no

428
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,150
me even be the largest mailman side in
the world but we

429
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,429
we use email to communicate within an
imam

430
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:24,520
local sees Tom so

431
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,840
if you can modes page there's them

432
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,260
this school the GOM

433
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,950
as it has in the the page it's a cancer

434
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,040
on because someone some analysts that
the

435
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,480
the index page is slow to generate com
but we use is this

436
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,690
the for Corning you know among

437
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,930
and between low climbs is so for example
for the Republican National Convention

438
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,720
we're gonna talk a bit in a bit about
this media space for welding

439
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,060
now all these people want to come to New
York and help with the space and help in

440
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,710
the planning

441
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,210
but they're not here yet so they can't
come to our physical meanings

442
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:07,850
so we get a lot of import through

443
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,970
through the email this works

444
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,120
surprisingly well especially if you have
the time to read it

445
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,890
there's a course you know the problems
inherent members

446
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,870
there

447
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,519
them personal and

448
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,429
people don't read them and all that but
by a large

449
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:30,149
we do get stuff done with it they also
provide a really good

450
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:35,269
their good form institutional memory
expected cancer

451
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:38,499
they are all archived on the Web which
is both good and bad

452
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:41,649
people either for newbies Jennifer game

453
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:45,849
don't unaware and someone in some local
collective

454
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:51,340
meeting at their house come to my house
I live at now 39

455
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,030
now road in here's my phone number

456
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,770
so a search on Google from your name
monthly

457
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,620
realize when interest first year when
someone

458
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,190
pointed that out that everything on our
print listless basically you could

459
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,270
google it up

460
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,300
the traffic drop precipitously

461
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,560
immediately afterwards and its

462
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,990
it is a little bit of an issue because
you don't wanna talk about sensitive

463
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:23,040
internal matters when anyone 10 just

464
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,450
find it because like we've had
advertised issues about big advertisers

465
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,070
and so

466
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:32,700
we can really put that on the list
because they could easily find it but it

467
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,130
but nonetheless it is useful for

468
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:40,060
as analyst organism question do you
wanna come to the Mikes

469
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,669
other folks too on

470
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,080
just feel I'm whatever

471
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:55,080
just chill out

472
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,080
while some analysts to actually have
closer cuz we need to be on the list

473
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,949
to join but in general we want as much
as possible to determine

474
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,610
open network where were transparent like
if you're not

475
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,080
partners yet we want you now you know

476
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,020
what we're about so sometimes causes
problems but I think the general

477
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,650
consensus is usually that the benefits
outweigh

478
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,750
year 2008 as you can imagine it's also

479
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:27,840
its it's more along a spectrum like it
what what party you going to close in 20

480
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,110
keep open like for a general print lists
its

481
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,810
them the archives are opened but we have
I

482
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:39,110
administrator approved Ford

483
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,240
non-members cuz added

484
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,210
doing administration we get like
probably twenty emails a day after

485
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,610
Witcher spans so a I have to go through
and

486
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,170
sort them all out blog called The new
addresses

487
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,310
then generally there three or four five
that or

488
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,570
words sending along but in the past when
we didn't have it

489
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:04,860
like that we would just get overwhelmed
with all sorts of crap

490
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,300
on the lesser and then there's we also
have had it been a couple people from

491
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:10,680
our

492
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,320
lesser because individually they were
just

493
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,260
muck things up so much all it takes is a
one wing not to start a flame war on the

494
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,900
listserv

495
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:26,900
that can last for months now

496
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,820
up

497
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,580
people like email people understand the
email specially folks who are non

498
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,480
technically inclined Tom like

499
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,880
email well I'm sure is technically
possible

500
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,920
I guess that your its kinda

501
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,400
a good point as a corollary -ism a lot

502
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,630
because it is volunteer-based Thursday
that

503
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:05,190
labor and a and you know it's

504
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,400
it may sound trivial but it is you know
it is an issue and

505
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,480
allow to technical decisions may not be
the best technical decisions but

506
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,480
day have been made I'm just simply
because

507
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,410
well there are enough people

508
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:28,410
like like olive you the phone hearing
that a

509
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,590
you know in and now with Gmail gonna
revolution did

510
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,269
enough

511
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:41,080
yes alright

512
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,050
this is somewhat interesting

513
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,809
like a sweet threat talked about most

514
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:52,920
already developing the weather trust
obviously

515
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,570
here here administering network %uh

516
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,649
web sites hit just go around

517
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,830
giving everybody access

518
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,870
I guess you could here

519
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,590
really excessive about it but it doesn't
happen that way I'm

520
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,790
but a a lot of a lot of security
concerns

521
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,840
usually kind date they think it focused
around

522
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,330
big big protests and and

523
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,590
international defense like

524
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:27,170
the Republican National Convention
that's happening here York City

525
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:30,190
at the end our guest I'm

526
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:35,660
around the world enemy has been subject
to

527
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,200
quite a lot police

528
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,160
surveillance and to I don't know

529
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,200
just generally associated with

530
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,050
fairly targeted unpopular in the eyes of
the law

531
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,389
group even though it is a news
organization and to

532
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,490
there you know that there unknown author

533
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,630
against such a local collective but most
media practicing

534
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,730
I really trying to hide I'm Kaiser
objectivity

535
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,800
but it is news a.m. I am

536
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,899
ans journalists irony

537
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:14,089
not necessarily had kit for

538
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,270
thanks for a political where are so
friendly

539
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,199
I'm but there's your physical security
around convergences

540
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,350
and and is is a pretty

541
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,339
important thing there's been a number
undercover

542
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,639
police that have infiltrated

543
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,100
than convergence space is and offices
and volunteered to help

544
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:40,918
and just generally do stuff Witcher

545
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,580
usually gets people pretty paranoid find
it out and and if if you're not prepared

546
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,469
then a nothing really productive comes

547
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,000
except for a buncha people that are free
to do anything which is

548
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,510
dive to say there they're not too bright
because ninety percent of the time

549
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,270
the they look like cops the ring
undercover uniform

550
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,040
I think it's like a like tight jeans a
bomber jacket

551
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,290
actually kinda wide that doesn't have a
mustache in

552
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:13,170
the they're they're overly muscled I
must say well we welcome

553
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,440
for sports fans and to the immune
network a large percentage of them have

554
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,290
the cops

555
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:22,990
has yet season 12 the negative thoughts
are talking about sports and

556
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,800
to get really interested a course
there's also need to

557
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,000
to balance up the security culture with

558
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,210
the openness that we want as

559
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,230
as the Internet there are people who
just want to anything

560
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,369
there so afraid the Consul find out even
when they're not doing anything even

561
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:42,410
slightly illegal

562
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:47,700
on so there's a real need for balance
that I think as as a global

563
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,560
collective were still tryna figure and
Anna

564
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,540
another one is around these these
convergences

565
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,990
protests there's a there's ad hoc

566
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,900
computer networks for I guess a lot like
this place

567
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,920
wired sometimes sometimes weeks in
advance usually days in advance

568
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,430
sometimes neither usually far less
expert yes

569
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,669
now it's nice to

570
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,960
obviously security concerns

571
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,780
with that and I'm sure mostly in the
answer

572
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,880
really internet security so I won't
ramble on

573
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,300
have to but it's a concern and also I
guess

574
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,150
at Sir leads up to I'm a more as

575
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,470
as like you know someone who's

576
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,710
into networks K hacker ish type

577
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,369
on personally I feel certain

578
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:52,900
an obligation to try

579
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,160
and be condom knowledge and awareness
about this subject

580
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,580
and treated in a somewhat I don't know

581
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,060
level-headed manner and cause a lot of
people just don't think about

582
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,610
and you know they think I'm not doing
anything

583
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:12,590
that needs security so obviously need to
pay attention to it

584
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,300
unite nothing to hide la I'm and Justin
are getting people aware

585
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,030
for have how the internet is a public
media

586
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,190
had a transfer information securely and
to

587
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:28,730
just various excess ways to get
attackers

588
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:32,970
know a lot of a lot of Unix based
cryptosystems a great and they work

589
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,620
really well

590
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,359
use them but they're not exactly the
most successful someone who

591
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,740
isn't interested in that kinda stuff
sour even if it

592
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,230
if it pains you to when user friendly
staff it's good to serve have a running

593
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,760
list what's out there and what's
available and could recommend it to

594
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,690
people into

595
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:56,690
and if they don't use it then it's their
own damn

596
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,950
preservers it's really useful and it's
politically Great

597
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,940
and it works here must everyone here
knows that ok

598
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,080
rate yeah but it's on it's actually it's

599
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,160
everyone here knows that but again serve
same is it the security culture it's

600
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,830
something that a.m.

601
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:18,990
a lot of people don't understand one of
the most common

602
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:25,240
responses I get is on its like freeware
the car can I get enough download a calm

603
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,760
something and and a lot of people that
that

604
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,820
are used to adjust her no crap in there
their wares for their windows box and

605
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,450
whatever maybe even not even using them
it takes

606
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,740
it's a big philosophical leaped sale
limit this is like

607
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,620
now freeware its suffering have to serve

608
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,640
Noster stay up if you're not already can
upon

609
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,029
on their the flask be behind it and why
it's useful

610
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,290
and a tryin construct your own

611
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,310
sorta rhetoric and and argument as to

612
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,630
wives on Anna generally

613
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,980
at Sir if you especially within within
the media

614
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:07,880
I'm he could she gone and a capitalist
Connotea

615
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,080
now three saturns I think personally
think is essentially

616
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,710
capitalist former a technology

617
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:18,750
so that's a good a comment answer just

618
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,740
has promoted and again stay up on what's
available and even if it's not

619
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,060
necessarily your specialty your sister
asap occasion that am

620
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,240
you you don't wanna you don't use every
day just be aware of its existence

621
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,390
and certain general resources right to
point people to

622
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,580
like to know that's a must edit audio
I'd ask screen answer sonya

623
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,910
battery might not have to know how to
use Audacity

624
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:49,910
but the point people to it stuff

625
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:54,430
on time the republicans are coming

626
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:01,430
I don't want them here om so I guess
most

627
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,170
you are aware course I should say it
again in case anyone's

628
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,170
mccloud that the the New York City

629
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,970
the New York city is going to be

630
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,680
host to the republicans this I guess
where they will

631
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,680
apparently have to mention and

632
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,980
and most comments I've been to either
learn something or decide something

633
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,710
hope that the republicans are doing
either but they are causing a lot of

634
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,660
traffic jams

635
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,410
on and we

636
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,868
a the estimates are just the half a
million people are going to

637
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:38,890
either come out of their houses will
come to New York City

638
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,910
to protest the republicans and to say

639
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,000
you know stop your silliness basically
stop

640
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,819
evil miss and in the meetings going to
be covering it

641
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:53,038
and worse name your thousand

642
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,240
or so journalists from all around the
country

643
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,950
in the world yes are going to be coming
to town and

644
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,400
we need to you know help them do their
jobs

645
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,420
on so we're

646
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,720
we're building or we're working on
building a space

647
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,220
where we can have we can host these
trials and let them do their work

648
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:21,109
this is of course a huge logistical
challenge working on finding the space

649
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,670
anything will will get it done some

650
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:29,650
yet we're just nailing down the last
minute details

651
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:35,380
and we week could have like a couple
thousand journalists

652
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,579
show there's gotta be something 15,000
at the RNC itself

653
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:44,559
but based on our previous experiences at
the World Economic Forum we had about

654
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,210
250 300 journalists register with us

655
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:52,630
that was only about 20,000 people

656
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:56,440
the streets and that was one day
protests

657
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,799
and during the artsy the protests
actually start on Thursday

658
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:05,349
August 27 that for the next week there's
multiple protests

659
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:11,480
by every group you can imagine for the
following 7 seven days

660
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,849
morning afternoon and evening I'm all
sorts of stuff from

661
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:19,950
marches and rallies there's plan Ford
unemployment lines stretching

662
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,750
like to Manhattan some faith-based
groups are talking about doing a circle

663
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,960
light like having people wearing men at
and

664
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,240
I'll hold up late Saddam 31st that
should be

665
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,140
when things are a little more interested
there's been a lot of calls for a

666
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,670
correct actions

667
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,619
that day around the city and a vid
upstart to see the first calls for a

668
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,869
activists this start doing stuff there's
and

669
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:48,539
anything organized at its more just
general called but it be great if

670
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:49,279
everybody

671
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:53,809
King get involved either in the streets
are online because

672
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:58,500
I think it's clear you know whatever you
think the republicans economic policies

673
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,259
in terms of civil liberties

674
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:03,799
electronic freedom they're pretty bad

675
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:06,829
and they're attacking on the bus so

676
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:10,410
this week offers us our chance to show

677
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,420
up someone so

678
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,670
in addition to to

679
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,500
smother on the political reasons to be
here there's a lot of time

680
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:24,330
work that needs to be done and defend
you wanna help

681
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,810
you know come see us %ah where

682
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:31,270
word were attending a space should be
finalized shortly am and

683
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,320
once more we've got it will need to wire

684
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,130
renewed phone lines we need fancy
dispatch systems review

685
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,200
computers we need you know wiring for
all that

686
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,920
and be near you know we don't have a
budget some cell

687
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,590
so it's it's a challenge but I think
well

688
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,660
a challenge that enemy is well suited to
I should have percent were working in

689
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,060
coalition with the number of

690
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,369
other a local independent media
movements

691
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:01,130
Media Group on an hour to get all this
done

692
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,140
but but the more people seriously the
better

693
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,529
yeah I'm

694
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,780
our website's month Campbell your

695
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:16,180
know how to do

696
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,779
questioned yeah with 60 questions we
only have about

697
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:26,780
a little under 5 10 minutes left so
souls

698
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,290
I

699
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:33,660
my cup

700
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:40,660
stud

701
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,330
yes and no um its

702
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,330
was asking about press credentials and
whether I

703
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,549
in the media journalists get press
credentials

704
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,880
yes if if you if you doing going out and
doing

705
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,830
real reporting arm its it's a lot easier
to get press credentials especially if

706
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,460
you're working in conjunction

707
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,630
with a newspaper because that you can

708
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,520
give clips and usually who you're
getting credentials from is

709
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,360
is the Police Department %uh or some
other

710
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,020
I agency like within New York love

711
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:47,030
our reporters and photographers Arkham
credentialed by the NYPD

712
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:50,970
that allows them to cross police lines
and we also have a couple people

713
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,120
were credentialed at the United Nations

714
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,160
on me if you don't have a paper it's a
little tougher because

715
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,410
you can't actually they always wanna see
clips and so how do you physically send

716
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:03,839
them

717
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,050
a clip that something its online on

718
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,540
it's it's harder to verify regarding the
Republican National Convention that was

719
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,140
a bit a bit

720
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,049
interesting experience I'll a number of
us went there to get

721
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:19,770
credentialing we were blacklisted we
were already

722
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,150
in doubt this is supposed to be an open
to bed that's being put on with hundreds

723
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,350
of millions of dollars a

724
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:29,790
public monies New York City New York
State US government

725
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,400
you note all taxpayer money and they had
a sauna blacklisted

726
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,140
they would let democracy now get
credential either

727
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,370
on not not surprising I

728
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,859
you know but that's the way the
republicans work

729
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,140
very they're very sneaky oMG porn

730
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:52,210
sometimes free pretty up front they had
a so the media walkthrough

731
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:55,240
I in the summer actually got it or

732
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:59,250
the space pursue the republicans com and

733
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,230
and so I went into those from by six
under which I guess they never heard of

734
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,590
before cuz they let me in

735
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,620
up but a room went in cities from in the
media and was a

736
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,630
immediately buttons Secret Service
heroes told the talk to the nice secret

737
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:13,230
service

738
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,310
and so our lists air from 2600

739
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,860
yet well tomorrow doesn't work because
then they them

740
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,350
i jus actually read the publication gave
me some mine about how they don't

741
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:23,960
potential

742
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,090
portables I at the RNC I

743
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,660
however there is a publication called
congressional quarterly

744
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,990
which strangely enough is credentialed
so if you can figure this out let me

745
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:41,990
know

746
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:45,910
K I'll we will answer questions very
quickly and then we have to go

747
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:51,368
the question was being a global network
had we implement our editing policy

748
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,630
I it really depends on

749
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:57,999
it's it's basically whose doing the work

750
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:01,130
I'm so in terms of the global in the
media website its

751
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,130
the people who are day-to-day active

752
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,609
on it decide what gets put on there

753
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:12,410
what does and it also depends on what
part 2 any in the media site that the

754
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:12,759
pic

755
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:16,069
there's right hand side is the open
newswire the center

756
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:20,499
is the features at those tend to be put
up by the local

757
00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:24,059
collective themselves so there's a much
higher

758
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:28,289
eyes love standards in terms of what
gets put on in the summer column

759
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:31,719
and you know as as we've noted that

760
00:48:31,719 --> 00:48:36,219
in the I open newswire we've had to do a
lot more moderation because

761
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:40,680
on what's in the media start to become
well known it started be taken over by

762
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,469
right-wingers we would have neo-nazi

763
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:47,329
posts on there %uh creation is

764
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:50,489
lights premises and that just people

765
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:53,579
you know fourteen-year-olds posting
corner jus

766
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:58,029
stupid comments and so it kind of forced
a lot of a

767
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:01,630
the locals and each local would decide
for itself what its

768
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:05,339
moderation policy is in how much to
moderate in hell

769
00:49:05,339 --> 00:49:09,209
how much not too ended is often cause
like a little firestorms

770
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:13,289
controversy with people yelling they're
being censored on

771
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:16,759
and that you know it's it's the same
with a thing like with the printer video

772
00:49:16,759 --> 00:49:19,259
like if you're deciding what gets in the
video

773
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:23,410
usually the person who's editing the
video or with the print project it's

774
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,739
usually the people were

775
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:28,869
working on the paper that's what the
good things about in the media

776
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:33,849
on that those who do the work are the
ones making the decisions of course is

777
00:49:33,849 --> 00:49:34,619
that there's

00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:39,009
bias against those who don't have a lot
free time to put into

779
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,939
the project but it seems that belts it
out pretty well

780
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:46,808
and think

781
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:51,170
we have two go now but thank you all for
coming and if you want to get involved

782
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,369
do things on the sly

783
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:54,039
or in part 1
