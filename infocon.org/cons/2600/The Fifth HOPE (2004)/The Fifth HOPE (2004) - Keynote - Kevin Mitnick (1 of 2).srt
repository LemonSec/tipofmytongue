Sunday are but now

52
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:26,620
for today we have something that

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,880
we have never be able to have before
because back in

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,640
the first held back in 1994 kevin was in
prison and %ah

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,239
after that he actually not make any for
he was on the run 1997 he was imprisoned

56
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,000
and then there was

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,150
there's always a reason for Kevin not to
be here

58
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,760
but there's no more reason for him not
to not to be here so

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,390
he is here finally this is this is the
combination

60
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,530
as the reason we started the whole
converts the first place to get kevin

61
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,560
Mitnick to New York and

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,739
help with it I'll says one hr

63
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,230
a couple really special people Kevin's
mother and grandmother are here

64
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:07,230
I think it's and

65
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,240
throughout throughout the entire ordeal
I've kevin's imprisonment in prosecution

66
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,760
they have been the the the the strength
behind

67
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,920
everything as far as Kevin standing up
to

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,750
for his rights just knowing that there
are people out here supporting him

69
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,890
they've always been there

70
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,890
and they've been a real inspiration to
me too just people who really understand

71
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,820
what's going on what he was accused of
what he did

72
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,820
what's unfair about it and it's just I
think that makes all the difference when

73
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,930
you have people who

74
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,470
who give a damn who are standing behind
you so I just wanna I wanna thank you to

75
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,220
you for being there

76
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:47,220
and for being here and I we can also say
kevin is the only a hacker to bring his

77
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,500
mom and grandmother to a conference

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,800
alright I without the words I've been
wanting to speak for ten years

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,800
ladies and gentlemen kevin Mitnick the
now

80
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,400
why

81
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,380
the

82
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,030
the

83
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:26,030
good to be home well first of all I want
to thank everyone for showing up for my

84
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,130
talk

85
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,669
its third great to be back home again
and

86
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,969
I want to thank everyone for all their
support they've given me over the years

87
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,460
in today by talking to be a little bit
different I usually talk for

88
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,630
companies and conventions and stuff like
that but in the talk about me

89
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,840
and the stuff that I've been through
they were I'm going in some entertaining

90
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,270
stories I think everyone will relate to
and enjoy

91
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,000
and I guess I am really for soccer bring
my mom and grandmother

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,860
to a conference so I Cove interesting

93
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,570
anyway I think I wasn't born about by
the way by talking to you

94
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,530
of about probably an hour 15 minutes to
an hour to happen to have a 30-minute

95
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,659
qns beso

96
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:15,770
everyone's where the time constraints
here I

97
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,068
born as a hacker because it ten years
old

98
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,349
I was fascinated with magic I love
allusions

99
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,650
and I would hang out at the corner magic
store for

100
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,849
hours and hours just to find out the
secret to a magic trick I always wanted

101
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:31,419
a bite

102
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:35,120
the forbidden fruit the forbidden Apple
but I always was and pursue

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,690
have information that should be secret
but for entertainment

104
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,719
I love doing allusions I love the
pulling pranks on

105
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:46,570
friends and family so about two years
later

106
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,570
the first system I hacked was in the
computer

107
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,240
was on the telephone but was the Los
Angeles

108
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,460
RTD unite our TV is for the rapid
transit district

109
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,289
so the young kid I i by hobby was riding
buses

110
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:05,050
I just like ride buses around all the
way through Los Angeles and San

111
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,719
Bernardino

112
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:09,919
my mom worked well long hours as a
single mother supporting me so Kevin had

113
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,430
to find something entertaining to do

114
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,930
so when am sitting at the back of the
bus

115
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,590
and i'm looking at the transfer go he
could pay a certain feeling by transfer

116
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,849
to transfer a different line

117
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:25,820
looking at it and it has a special punch
in its punch with the date in the

118
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,800
direction we're going.

119
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,630
and you can use this as a ticket to go
on the next bus something to myself

120
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,190
about 11 eleven and a half years old
this is kind of interesting

121
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,580
so I got to the bus driver has about 20

122
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,789
get off the bus like a sir are work at
his punches and a special project for

123
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,510
school

124
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,419
and I like the kinda shapes these are
these are really cool shapes were gonna

125
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:49,719
buy one of these punches

126
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:54,270
he told me the name at the store in
downtown Los Angeles

127
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,900
I get off the first time in the social
engineer well here's so I go to the

128
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,969
store downtown LA i by myself and I
shiny punch

129
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:05,949
oh wow this is cool I can punch my own
transfers

130
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,270
problem was I didn't have any transfers

131
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,909
just thinking my grandmother lived about
a two miles away from the

132
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,180
RTD bus depot I was taking a human
nature people are lazy

133
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,729
so I think these bus drivers probably
after a long day riding a bus to take

134
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:21,080
these

135
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,859
transfers they have usually just on the
track so Kevin at eleven and a half

136
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,199
became a dumpster diver

137
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,550
and I wanted to the RT trashing fished
are all these plane transfers

138
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,958
and I use the point when transfers and
ride the bus system bus drivers

139
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,930
knew what I was doing because it seemed
boarding the bus let the outgoing to the

140
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:40,589
punch

141
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,070
right prepared well be salt water pipes
the punch

142
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,920
another transfer on the bus for somebody
else and the driver

143
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,959
thought it was cute right

144
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,530
everyone thought it was cute no one told
me I was defrauding RTD

145
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,520
right and I guess I have all been a
photographic memory because actually

146
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,210
ended up

147
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,490
memorizing the entire schedule for every
box

148
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,600
in los angeles county so find a way to
go from point A to point B

149
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,680
it. what time to be at what place
without referencing

150
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,170
any type of schedule so was kind of
interesting

151
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,729
one day I was riding the bus I met this
other guy who's a ham radio operator

152
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,180
response services hey are a kid I can
this really all

153
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,520
on the back a bus to go to Disney him to
go all that up held up in each day

154
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,630
but early age teenager all that a police
radio I'm thinking well that's cool I'd

155
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,750
like to listen to police

156
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,620
they got no this is a ham radio show
introduced me to the ER

157
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,280
to the hobby if they were to radio and I
was

158
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,880
so intrigued not with the radio but if
the auto patch people believe that

159
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,980
making phone calls over radio I thought
the RR Patil school

160
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,450
I could have a slow each T hand-held
this is like twenty years ago

161
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,720
like a diary phone number I thought that
was how I want to be able to do that

162
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,490
right so are going to buy autocad story
so

163
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,750
to be for the next talk but my most the
most fun I've had

164
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,590
with a radio for getting the phones and
computers was

165
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:16,360
the drive-up windows at McDonalds
because you can put a wiring some sort

166
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,960
of certain

167
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,460
certainly feels like the lingering you
can go out abandon transfer name

168
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,170
transmit on any frequency so we stepped
on a McDonald's

169
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,660
so the driver customer drive up to the
drive-up window and we now become the

170
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,699
McDonald's employee

he walks up to the speaker right and he
has a space in the speaker

191
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,180

194
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,740
they already don't like me

195
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,199
so what's up fast forward a little bit
too high school

196
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:03,199
I have radio pop I'm really into radio I
mean playing with the auto patch

197
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,829
maybe this other kid his dad's a ham
radio operator

198
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:11,199
and he was a what they called over so he
wanted to borrow my radio in exchange

199
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:11,860
for

200
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,860
showing me stock about phones and I
could really care less at the time

201
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,329
but then you start showing some stop how
we can call a secret number

202
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:22,470
in the phone company anything give the
phone number

203
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,160
and the operator get immediately give
the name and address without asking any

204
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,740
questions was called the scene a pure

205
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,899
how was able you taking the neighbor a
family

206
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,910
number that has an unlisted telephone be
recalled a caller bureau call the number

207
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,429
bureau

208
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:38,579
people a sweet talker at getting an
unlisted telephone number

209
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,970
family member the really think that a
treat me

210
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,410
he said I have this protest number the
call the stock number: you hear a tone

211
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,129
any putting five digits you can call
anywhere in the world for free

212
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,329
later on another sprint for that it
wasn't calling for store for free

213
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:55,869
somebody was paying the bill but I'm

214
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:59,389
no high school kid i'd so

215
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:03,759
whatever started in photo was really
learning about the telephone network I

216
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:04,139
have

217
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,939
passion for technology was just it was
fascinating and the people I read about

218
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:11,949
like a giant creeper Captain Crunch is I
know is here in steve wozniak

219
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:16,740
I read about their a experiments and
with the phone system in the kind

220
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,509
intrigue me and I wanted to learn more

221
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,160
more and more so the rotator

222
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,749
was a very risky route this is where I
first learned about social engineering

223
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:29,189
because I learned about the phone
company was it like you can

224
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:32,410
go down and get a manual I did read the
the

225
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,889
a the bell technical journals at UCLA
library I was pretty cool

226
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,610
but a lot of it was about pretending to
be another employee

227
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,519
calling up another department within
phone company and sweet talking them

228
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,949
how to do something campus customer's
phone was a disconnected by mistake I

229
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:48,829
would connect

230
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,069
and in learning about their internal
operations that's where I first learned

231
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,509
about

232
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:58,029
social engineering back in the late
seventies but a little bit more bold

233
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:59,720
than that I wanted I was really

234
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,139
want to learn about you know the
equipment how it worked so late one

235
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:04,569
night

236
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:10,009
around one in the morning I guess it's
an actual story got right today

237
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,429

277

about 15 minutes later that same God
percent authorities looking all around

280
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,730
crazy stop

281
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,929
I mean I cause so much I guess for

282
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:48,179
such a pain in the ass to the phone
company but they eventually had to take

283
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,519
out or telephone

284
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,029
I was at home living with my mom is a
teenager and the phone company actually

285
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:53,870
removed

286
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,269
are follow can you imagine there they
said no phone for mitnick

287
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,339
and I was thinking oh this is not fair
so I lived in unit 13

288
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,530
they actually had a blocked off that
line assignment which is a special

289
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:07,908
division

290
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:12,829
uncle be no photo okay Psycho author of
Facilities Department

291
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:17,898
and I tell them there's a new unit being
installed will be

292
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:23,780
okay so so we might as well be shortly
see you two should allocate if they need

293
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,119
service

294
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,429
you know them a customer may default on
their wait about three days

295
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,070
I got a hardware store forget well-being

296
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,600
about 12 a but

297
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,820
phone company was not happy about three
months later they figured it out there

298
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,899
they need a couple together

299
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:46,210
I I think anyone to their apartment
building

300
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,429
let me go through security for the
beautiful rope

301
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,289
know why these guys ever since humor

302
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,580
so let's summit high school really in
the phones

303
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,129
into switching learning how to stop work
and that's when the phone company was

304
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:02,580
going from step-by-step

305
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,210
crossbar yes trucks switching systems

306
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,020
and computers time for the front and to
control these

307
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,340
these devices and I like to pull pranks
on friend so I was like to get access

308
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,980
to the switch electronically so

309
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,889
when I was in high school this friend
introduced me to the computer instructor

310
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:23,340
its

311
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,199
and try to get me in the class news
article here trigonometry what would

312
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,559
your prerequisites

313
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,210
I don't know I don't have those about
medical prerequisites but still like to

314
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,450
take last year let me in

315
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,929
as well and my friend my friend says
social some other

316
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,039
phone freaking stuff a course I start
showing the teacher

317
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:44,240
some other cute things I could do with
the phone anyways the prerequisites

318
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,190
for oh that's cool so first assignment

319
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,529
write a basic program appoints the first
100 100 production numbers

320
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:56,659
barring I decided I wrote my first
program was to write

321
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:00,090
a login simulator so when the teacher
would i look to the

322
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:06,020
PDP 11 off-site he be talking to my
programs to the operating system

323
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,320
giving me the password he was using

324
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,520
air its stores password the following go
have a login

325
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,129
and every time I go up to him and given
his new password it would drive him

326
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,970
crazy

327
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,299
even to the point he put it on paper
tape

328
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,690
like the password the six character pass
reduces the risk to see operating system

329
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,389
for all your old timers outer

330
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:29,820
and every day I remember the
configuration of the holes

331
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,549
in a right and a good friend so what's
the second line right down we figure out

332
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,250
the password right

333
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,309
so I got bored with the they have an HP
2000 at school

334
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,990
a lot of issues to play games like Star
Trac torque adventure

335
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,690
but USC always had the better games

336
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,260
and our modem at the school we had all
abedi

337
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,260
110 bout terminal so got to the school

338
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,690
1110 by these days we couldn't go
outside

339
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,820
we can only die within the campus so
nice news call the operator

340
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,309
hi this is mister Crist I'm trying to
get an outside line to connect with

341
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,899
such-and-such number

342
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:11,000
the people the dial into USA we pay per
play the games they have on their

343
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,440
computers

344
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,470
so the teacher got when did this because
it was a teletype terminal go back on

345
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,470
the paper go

346
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,070
what are you up to again Kevin drive me
crazy

347
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,320
so one day he walks in the class
renounces get everyone together cuz I

348
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,678
found the solution

349
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,780
the stopgap

350
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,760
any holds up a telephone lock this is a
dial telephone

351
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,070
they probably places the lockable number
one position

352
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,129
is a big smile on his face ago

353
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:44,909
this is gonna be part you up

354
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:48,580
so you're closer Chris were with the
phone number for the main

355
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,770
school no one was me probably gives me
the numbers

356
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,020
he wants to meet Rick pick up the phone
and a possible number

357
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,580
predicted he got so angry the teacher

358
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,859
his face turned red in turn white be
ripped up the phone and threw it across

359
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:05,820
the river

360
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,359
so as you can see I started off on a
good for

361
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,629
right so my first app people alike

362
00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:16,760
the first time I packed into a system
and

363
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,070
I met the system admin it was the
administratively

364
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,899
leus de los tenis while Los Angeles
Unified School District computer

365
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:28,210
and these guys are really are clever
with computers these guys were like

366
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,879
your true hackers and I want to I want
to learn from these guys I want to

367
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:32,690
become a member

368
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,990
their peer group and these guys were in
the hacking risk to say

369
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:41,169
any word hacking different types of doc
operating systems

370
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:44,600
so they had a friend that work for risk
to see development

371
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,820
and the obtained the dialup number to
the to the system

372
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,340
and this was the system for the
development of its operating system

373
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,790
so they said they said Kevin if you can
get into that system

374
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,280
you can join our group and we can share
information

375
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,619
I think to myself I don't know much
about you know hacking at the time

376
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:07,220
by I don't know much about that
particular operating system also has

377
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,590
dial a number one negative

378
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,780
yes a pass for this is what I say to
myself

379
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,629
so I do a little research I found out
one of the developers names as Anton

380
00:22:15,629 --> 00:22:17,080
Chernoff

381
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,500
I call the main number attack and found
out the

382
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,210
name and the person that was responsible
for administering administrating system

383
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,429
something I give it a shot called the
system administrator

384
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:32,629
got a great this isn't always so what's
going on with the system

385
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:35,679
as we talk about I try to login to mike
l

386
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,970
saw one comma 113 someone me and I i
work to do

387
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,409
because a hold on a second he comes back
and goes you don't have one common 113

388
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:44,149
you have

389
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:47,609
other account number I said I know I
have that one but also one color 113 cuz

390
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,799
work in special project

391
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,859
said egos ago what's going on well for
some reason

392
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,760
its the account doesn't exist so we can
create it for me I'm really in a rush

393
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,970
your password you were a jellyfish

394
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,970
okay he was okay great egos thank you
and i got thank you Collins

395
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,649
i dial up in all happy but it won't
cover 113 put in jellyfish it says

396
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:15,139
dialup Password well they know their
I'll pass for

397
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:19,549
so called the guy back they are what's
up with a dialup Password

398
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:22,668
I R to change once more because he had
been together

399
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:27,289
emailing ok what's going on you know
that's buffoon

400
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:30,549
okay right

401
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:34,020
thursday was the food

402
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,020
so as well my first act into

403
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,460
Daqing actually I was into their network
for

404
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,240
for many many years in then I but my
goal was

405
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,960
as a as a hacker was to find I what my
goal was at the end of the day

406
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,700
was everything was in the further into
becoming better at the skill

407
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,059
circumventing security finding a way to
pick the lock

408
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,099
in the quickest way in the most
effective way possible

409
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:03,189
another time be a mess which is a
different operating system

410
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,240
manufactured by Dec I was close source
like Windows

411
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,470
lets you get the access a source code
the publisher after ripping off

412
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,730
University

413
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,859
arm and what it is I made another stupid
decision in my life I figured it

414
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:20,520
I'm gonna go get the VM a source so

415
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,849
i'm looking source code again a transfer
to USC

416
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:27,470
because I I don't have enough stored on
my laptop told the whole source

417
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,419
countries I think I think on USC

418
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:33,599
well look to the code was plus 32 and
I'll look for

419
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,599
0 comments on any security patches that
were applied in there be able to work

420
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,908
the patch backwards with the whole was

421
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:42,149
or to be polite and potholes that they
haven't even figured out yet

422
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:45,929
that was my goal but figured be much
safer for me to look at the source code

423
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:46,970
tree

424
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,940
on USC's computers but it would be
adapts there was a lot less chance of

425
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,010
detection

426
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,970
so my cohort that was working with me on
this another of fellow hacker that I met

427
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,080
in high school

428
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,418
he ratted me out the feds it's a long
story

429
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:05,659
in the one-day he calls me up on the
phone this is less income each other

430
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:09,750
come to my office II need I need a
couple those discs that have

431
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,970
some information that we worked on
before

432
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,849
so one Friday night 5 o'clock in the
afternoon I Drive down

433
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,149
to his office may go in the underground
parking garage and surprisingly he was

434
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:21,789
like outside

435
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:26,460
lego halo become your in a goes oh yeah
do you have your blue bag with

436
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,530
but I was going to wear your brother
this so I going to the truck to get my

437
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,389
DS

438
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:33,690
the Leveson all these car starts
reaching right

439
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,190
so was a setup was a FBR and

440
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,750
the probably are promptly arrested me
and took me to the terminal island

441
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:46,399
federal prison Sam Peter California and
all I was concerned about was how much

442
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:47,760
is my bail

443
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,190
I want to get outta here so I stay there
the weekend

444
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,549
and to Monday morning they take me down
to the FBI office and they take

445
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:57,570
photographs

446
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:01,158
everything electronic terrorist
photograph but the other media loves to

447
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:01,889
use

448
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:05,470
that was that photograph back in 1988

449
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,849
so they take me down and taken to court
affiliate finally go to court to set the

450
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:13,168
bail or get out will be a ton story

451
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:17,490
so show up to court and the introduce me
to this public defender

452
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,059
spoke to me about for five minutes
anything even know how to turn on a

453
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:21,668
computer

454
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:25,330
the only question was your passport well
yeah but

455
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,990
a my family will bring it that's an
issue we going to court

456
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,940
families there I'm sitting down
expecting bail to be posted I'm outta

457
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,440
here

458
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,899
prosecutor stanza does your own

459
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:43,359
not only do we have to calmest mister
mitnick and attention

460
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,510
so we have to make sure he can get
access to tell

461
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,260
because i picking access to a telephone
he could pick up the phone and call in

462
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,299
or red

463
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:56,220
any kid with all the codes to launch a
nuclear weapon

464
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,500
I'm thinking by self ago nobody could be
that stupid

465
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,539
the victorious a and your honor we have
evidence that mister because compromise

466
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,230
the security of the National Security
Agency

467
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,710
and even though this hearing is open to
the public we feel comfortable we can

468
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,080
discuss this

469
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,240
and so they found a a filing with those
floppy disk all

470
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,609
in SA tot text and what I did there is a
system called dock master

471
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,809
was run by the National Computer
Security Center and I did who is on it

472
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:25,470
remember the old days how you people a
list of the registered users at the

473
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,349
house

474
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:29,849
by capture the output into a file called
in SA tot taxed

475
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,899
and the prosecutor turned that into I
compromise the security of the National

476
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:36,289
Security Agency

477
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:41,230
they talk about war games and how the
movie war games is probably based on

478
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,230
what I could do

479
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,639
they were scaring the heebie jeebies how
this federal magistrate

480
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:53,129
so at the end of the day the prosecutor
asked for a special detention order

481
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,609
that they keep me away from every
électronique device in detention

482
00:27:56,609 --> 00:28:00,349
no-bail and so the place where the only
place they could put me

483
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:03,530
the whole which is a solitary
confinement

484
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,629
I was in the hole for about nine months
what about you half months

485
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:11,580
that's where you lock down 23 hours a
day they let you out for about an hour

486
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,080
day

487
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,389
equally sized room but it outside we can
get fresh air

488
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:20,669
remember going to the shower which was
all like

489
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:23,820
10 feet away they actually have you
stick your hands to disrupt ornate

490
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,750
handcuff you

491
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,859
stick your legs are or your feet

492
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:31,500
through another door they put the lake
irons on you it walking 10 feet

493
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,730
to another cell that was a shower the
block you in there then they take out

494
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,020
the handcuffs

495
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,359
right that's how high security arise and
after about

496
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,399
eight-and-a-half months I started to get
a little bit crazy

497
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,879
so the government went to my turn and
said hey we have a deal for your client

498
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:51,059
deeply doubt 12 months in custody mealy
open a general population will recommend

499
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,099
while Park camp which is like going on
vacation

500
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:58,510
and it's a done deal we're going to
fight will keep 'em in the whole

501
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,350
and if he does a convicted and we said
so we're gonna ask the judge keeping

502
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,129
their

503
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:07,669
in four sets and so what would any sane
person do I sign to get the hell outta

504
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,039
there

505
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,039
so 1990 I was released from our long
Park camp

506
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,240
in the the campus a I was there for
about four months

507
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,840
so I'm released 1991

508
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,679
I get a phone call from my brother my
half-brother

509
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,259
he said his girlfriend call them because
she has a friend in San Diego name

510
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:33,549
eric heinz Eric always wanted to meet me

511
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:38,220
and he's a hacker himself and he just
wanted to see what I'm up to these days

512
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,480
my brother warned me goes I'd be careful
because this girl that

513
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,980

horrible

514
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,580
go out looking at her to talk to this
guy

515
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,019
so I call this other guy is given the
following this guy named Henry spiegel

516
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:57,690
who I was in hollywood every time I went
to the couple America have to call Henry

517
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,169
to eventually they're icky me his pager
number

518
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,120
inner was always asking like probing
questions like what are you up to these

519
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,990
days

520
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:09,980
who you associate with I go I'm not
doing anything illegal in just

521
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,730
you're just curious what you have to
what you what you have to tell me

522
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,350
we decided to meet for dinner one night
a hamburger hamlet in LA

523
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:24,620
and he tells us about the system that
Kevin Poulsen in Him found

524
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,950
called sets with the system we could
secretly

525
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,070
monitor anybody within pactel service
area

526
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,509
and you can even see is there a dial
tone I mean it was like this system that

527
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:36,080
had

528
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,830
hardly know security and the power was
you know pretty compelling specially

529
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,470
we could monitor data 1200 block

530
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,940
cycle wow that's kind of interesting
kinda pique my interest

531
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,610
even though I was on supervised release
and I was kinda out at the scene for

532
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,059
about a year and a half

533
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:57,889
so I decided ask a suspicious about this
guy air

534
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:01,679
wanted to find out who he really was

535
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,720
so at the time the PU C 10 terror

536
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,899
caller ID in California you can get

537
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,149
the service was there just can't get so
since

538
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,440
pack building implemented I decided I
would

539
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,320
I got the switch input caller ID on a
friend's number lol

540
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,499
yet a device at 3:30 in the morning i
paged

541
00:31:22,499 --> 00:31:26,789
Eric to my friends number but the wrong
number

542
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:30,230
they're called it displayed his number

543
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,279
and I got up that I turned the caller ID
aw

544
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,789
so when I look at that number through my
phone freaking knowledge I was able to

545
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:42,049
determine what address that phone number
worked at it was the Oakwood apartments

546
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:44,830
in Los Angeles

547
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,600
so I call it the awkward management ago
hey this is Jerry over ok with the

548
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,940
you know Seattle I have a a customer who
says that he

549
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,009
he's already renting with you in Los
Angeles spring application over here

550
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:00,399
and/or systems down people's real
application

551
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,940
so the nice lady on the other end to the
phone calls as rental application

552
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,129
then proceeds to rate me everything on
the Rental app

553
00:32:07,129 --> 00:32:11,200
and what you gotta do employment there
was only one phone number there

554
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,499
but thats was listed the self-employment
I still remember the number to 1350 77

555
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:19,279
78 to

556
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,490
got interesting I don't know that number
so I decided I'm gonna pull the phone

557
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,409
records

558
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:26,950
the south or was a self up so pull the
records in the sea

559
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,679
you know what interesting numbers I
could find who is this guy

560
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,529
the other interesting thing is that
number that I i deed was interested in

561
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:34,309
the name

562
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:38,200
eric heinz but was in the name Joseph
world

563
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,139
I thought that was odd when one person
lived in that apartment

564
00:32:42,139 --> 00:32:46,190
I pull the phone records the media at
Lee I find out something's wrong I see

565
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,549
this number on their over and over and
over again

566
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,580
310 477 656 what

567
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,619
that never happens to be the the
telephone number for the Los Angeles

568
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:57,610
headquarters at the FBI up

569
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:02,149
what I saw that I knew something was
very wrong

570
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:05,580
so then I start digging a little deeper

571
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,700
and I decided I was gonna pull the
Social Security record so I can find out

572
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,330
where this

573
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,529
Eric Hines had worked before call the
deck where you can find over some things

574
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:17,070
work since 1978

575
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,320
like I find out the mother's maiden name
the father's name

576
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,809
that the birthplace of Pennsylvania for
this guy Joseph oral

577
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:28,259
and that they proceeded to find out try
to track down the parents

578
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:31,460
and the pair mother's name was mary

579
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,559
Eberly the father's name I think was
Joseph world senior

580
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:38,940
so go on to some databases and I find
out another show support all in the same

581
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,340
city

582
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,179
that the Social Security record indicate
it was the father and the mother and I

583
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:46,159
call up and I said

584
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,499
never speak to mister world whose goal
Social Security Administration

585
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:54,200
how can I help I think we got a record
skewed arm

586
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,649
on this benefit up application and a
string string it out

587
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:01,100
may speak to marry up early plays or
she's my sister

588
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,450
I'll check your white she's my sister or
okay

589
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,440
well here's another person on your list
as Joseph world user

590
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,270
goes well that's me goes another Joseph
/url thats younger

591
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,299
years ago because im Mary up early have
a assign

592
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:22,909
years or younger sons names Joseph Joe
ways but he's an FBI agent in el

593
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:26,250
well no way so just a portal

594
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,500
the cover identity for Joe way so that I
knew something was very wrong

595
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,279
so in my I guess my obsessive little
behavior finding out the answer to this

596
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:39,359
a problem in a question of who Eric
Hines was

597
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:43,440
I decided I'm gonna get DMV photographs

598
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,049
soccer I call it Department motor
vehicles and in Sacramento

599
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:51,399
a given the proper requester codes and I
have them

600
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:55,100
fax over the driver's license
photographs for Joseph ways

601
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,960
Joseph portal haircut

602
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,589
and I had to go to a Kinkos in Santa
Monica so

603
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:05,750
they would have impacted the key not
really grainy in the fax

604
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,400
was cool I could see the pictures
clearly

605
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,750
so be it I'll try them another weekend
with another fax machine probably be

606
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,190
better

607
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,250
so this I'm a week passes the pic I
wanna get those photographs again

608
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,900
so I decided on a different a different
kinko's

609
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,630
Studio City Calif so

610
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:30,020
Christmas Eve 1992 I show up at the
Kinkos

611
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,759
now go in is a super busy and

612
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:36,859
I'm really anxious to get the
photographing the rather

613
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:41,160
so by the counter and nobody's there

614
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,980
so I figured okay I'll just grab the fax
to leave a couple bucks not be up there

615
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,779
it's done I don't want

616
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:50,049
I got behind the counter I go to File
unplug the fax

617
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:55,660
for the name that I used a request from
the DMV it was a picture this all-woman

618
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,839
like from like a textbook I'm pissed

619
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,210
because I have somewhere to get go I
have to get to somewhere at a certain

620
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,380
time and now

621
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,739
after compaq is incompetent people at
DMV because they screwed up

622
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:11,130
some looking for a farm in the studio
city Kinkos and walking back and forth

623
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,500
is no phone there for customer use them
trying to contemplate what I should do

624
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,900
little did I know I had DMV
investigators and FBI there were also

625
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,930
in the Kinkos that were calling me back
and forth right

626
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,960
so go out to the payphone outside well I
got my thoughts together for gonna call

627
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,089
these people up

628
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:34,970
give them my two sets because they can't
even fax over a photograph correctly

629
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,529
so I get on the PayPal right outside the
Kinkos

630
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:43,700
and I don't wanna die man of course is a
calling card up

631
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,799
not like a llegar butter I am

632
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,960
I I call up for dear be in office and
all these people

633
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,450
in suits coming up now looking at

634
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:01,160
and holding the facts oh yeah can I help
you

635
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,080
I think I'll no worries the delivery we
will have a conversation with you

636
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,799
playing up the phone ago really well
guess what I don't have a conversation

637
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,540
with you and I threw the backs up

638
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:17,369
a rare any no stairmaster does wonders
if you do a commercial for stairmaster

639
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,220
because I used to do it every day

640
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,220
and the I beat them in the boat race

641
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,059
yeah so I figure that's a good time

642
00:37:34,059 --> 00:37:38,079
a to go underground a figure that

643
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,690
something serious was going to happen
with the now I knew that eric heinz was

644
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,499
definitely

645
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:46,650
either an FBI agent or an informant and
I knew that

646
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:51,329
I knew I was a target for and at the
time I was really scared

647
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:54,690
being put into solitary confinement
again because if you're never locked up

648
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,029
in

649
00:37:55,029 --> 00:37:58,329
in a room that's like say 10 bike 6 for
23 hours a day

650
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:01,779
for a perhaps for eight months you'd
probably feel the same way

651
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,289
so I decided the change my name

652
00:38:05,289 --> 00:38:08,529
I moved to Denver but I became

653
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:12,410
Eric Weiss and

654
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,848
I work at a law firm it's one is anyone
aware crisis

655
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:21,779
Harry Houdini I thought it was funny the
FBI did

656
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:26,959
third the thing a magical solution right

657
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:30,319
Simon I'm I'm in December

658

account that actually extracted

709
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,630

717
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,380

program called

718
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,600
FTP

719
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,740
you have a file transfer program is a
purse

720
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:06,080
nicely and I'm thinking as a walking I
never expected this to work

721
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,790
this is all extemporaneous something you
working I have a transfer to that

722
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,340
doesn't

723
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,140
go back to Eric Weiss kevin Mitnick or
anything so I remembered I

724
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,359
new an account to Colorado super net
which was an ISP in Denver

725
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,820
that I remember the a I remembered the
account name and password I also

726
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,280
remember the IP address

727
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,100
thank God because I was thinking giving
a slated FTP the source code to

728
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,410
no super not da Colorado dodi you would
have been

729
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,100
you know a big red flag so instead I say
okay I woulda

730
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,620
have you open up an FTP session she
types FTP okay opening ever

731
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,240
the IP address and it just sits there
dead as a doornail

732
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,980
she goes it's not working chicos maybe
this could be a security related issues

733
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,900
i got really into government gonna let
me talk to my security minister gonna

734
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:57,840
no no she puts metal ready to hit the
end button on the phone right

735
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,120
and she comes back five minutes later

736
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,509
she said she couldn't get all the
security administrator but she spoke to

737
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,980
the system administrator in it is a
security issue

738
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,880
and since the files being transferred
outside world campus

739
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,370
you have to use a special proxy server
but he was kind enough to give the user

740
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,120
name password to the proxy server

741
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,540
i'm looking at my phone ago

742
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,980
if this be real

743
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,480
so by the time I put my key into the
front door

744
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,079

746
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,720
wasn't happy about that one so later on
a move to Seattle is going to be some

747
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,390

778
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,200

779
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,769

785
00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:44,230
I'm listening for that the stroke then I
get interested in the conversation right

786
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:49,319
so few hours later and done working my
resume to get printed on the ivory linen

787
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,739
stop and they decide to walk on the
opposite side of the street

788
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:57,599
hope walking the opposite side I see a
financing from the apartment to people

789
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,190
in their

790
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:03,420
I go around the block and I noticed by
lights were off in my apartment that was

791
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,529
kinda strange

792
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:08,650
say but the managers like them second
level was on so wasn't a power failure

793
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:12,690
so benchley I got enough guts to go to
the managers and they knocked on his

794
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,579
door this is like

795
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:16,880
after midnight ago hey this is Brian

796
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,999

797
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:25,220
and for I could you not only my
apartment wheels no but they let

798
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,359

799
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,480

800
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:31,930

downs a call right to it needless to say

803
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,399
I decided not to go to my apartment

804
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,930

00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:25,430
cracked the door much about twelve
people end up in my studio apartment

831
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,368
because sir are you kevin Mitnick ago I

833
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:36,700
new North Carolina driver's license with
the name or my picture course

834
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,400
and the FBI agent examines a closing
those

835
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,779
Scott this about two weeks ago okay us
along North Carolina when you move

836
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:48,239
you have to get if change a residency up
in your license before we're probably

837
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,960
gonna back up

838
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,200
so then the agent start searching around
my apartment

839
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,650
legal excuse me are you looking for
livestock

840
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,059
egos your article do you have a work

841
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:05,469
they hit me this piece a paper that says
US USB kevin Mitnick no address

842
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:09,289
ago goes for someone not this mitnick I

843
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:12,469
and second of all this is a look like
your search for I mean

844
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:15,589
does every hundredth because noted

845
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:18,660
to search for an I gotta you're not
searching here to get my attorney on the

846
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,170
phone

847
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:24,279
ago hi John this is a broader what I
think lines and he was using

848
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:28,420
and I he talked to the agent into bales
to get a search warrant so they all

849
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,450
also the case agent left

850
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,960
this when he did the site is gonna go
through my briefcase I knew that I

851
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,170
didn't want to go to my briefcase
because of something I had in there

852
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:42,719
other identity stuff so I was looking
through my briefcase I go up in a slam

853
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:45,440
it shut in a walk

854
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,799
and it goes he is very angry because you
open this up right now

855
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:54,579
I'm breaking into it so I stop people
breaking into it but I'm not opening it

856
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:58,900
the course in every day because he would
need a search for to open it

857
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,150
so then surely about an hour and a half
later

858
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:05,739
they're searching I'm yelling at them to
get the after outta my apartment

859
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:09,079
and I'm not this mitnick I so they hit
it with a

860
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,210
they got all the circle and put me in
the middle the circle and they have this

861
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,849
piece a paper they were looking at

862
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:20,380
it was a US Marshals Most Wanted Poster
my picture on it

863
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,809
so but I look different I'll dust ash a
very long hair

864
00:50:23,809 --> 00:50:27,349
I could easily fluctuate my way to
change my books so I don't look anything

865
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:28,859
like the pitcher

866
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,940
so here it to me they go does this look
like you

867
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,670
so of course I take it and study it
anything I'm in a sec

868
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:39,940
let me know if you look at me look at me
work like Mia all

869
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,219
in ago but after 15 minutes

870
00:50:43,219 --> 00:50:47,380
they're confused they go well sir
frankly we don't know

871
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,009
if you're kevin Mitnick but we want to
do something we want to take you down

872
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:54,480
to our FBI office and fingerprint you

873
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,339
it will do a fingerprint comparison I
said why don't you guys think of this

874
00:50:58,339 --> 00:50:59,269
earlier

875
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:03,049
what you put me through this three hours
ago this shenanigan many

876
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:06,089
just fingerprinted be back when we
schedule appointment tomorrow morning at

877
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:12,190
10 a.m.

878
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:17,880
they were never that figure they wanted
those fingerprints now

879
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,910
so inevitable that a an agent was
searching my closets

880
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:25,098
found a leather jacket and leather
jacket with a wallet

881
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:28,460
he pulled up the wallet I tried to stop
him but I was gonna touch a federal

882
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,630
agent of course

883
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,410
people that these identities of my
picture in different names

884
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,700
because what's this ago all those are my

885
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,999
alternate personalities

886
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:44,869
there they arrested me when they never

887
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:48,640
wasn't the humor so

888
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,038
every time I was the proud winner the
scapegoat sweepstakes

889
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,690
and thats were I letter my eye like long
journey through the

890
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:01,500
federal criminal system are immediately
I was labeled a computer terrorist by

891
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,029
the doji

892
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:08,130
arm you know the Osama bin that make up
the Internet

893
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:11,819
but I i helped some records I was first
place in the solitary confinement

894
00:52:11,819 --> 00:52:16,099
in in the county jail in North Carolina
and I was forbidden

895
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,920
I was like held incommunicado now after
about a week

896
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,059
my attorneys in Los Angeles negotiated a
deal the highway potentially waive all

897
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:25,000
rights

898
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,509
but they would let me are the whole in
at only be allowed to call certain

899
00:52:28,509 --> 00:52:29,500
people

900
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,699
so if they do I wanna spend do I wanna
be the whole for months more or do I

901
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:34,449
wanna get the general population

902
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:38,489
away the rights lightweight the right to
decide

903
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:42,579
and then I ended up in Hell its kinda
it's a long story but I'm going to cover

904
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,099
the highlights for about four and a half
years

905
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:48,710
without a bail hearing which is actually
a constitutional because

906
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,640
everyone thats arrested accused of any
offence

907
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,769
is allowed to get a hearing in front of
a neutral and detached

908
00:52:55,769 --> 00:52:59,599
decision-maker and this is where both
sides have the opportunity

909
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,029
to determine a to prove to unusual
decision maker whether there's any

910
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:06,440
condition or combination of conditions

911
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,789
they're reasonably sure that the
personal appear at trial

912
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:14,059
and the judge in my case was so poisoned
against me because you know I could

913
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:16,670
launch nuclear missiles by whistling in
their telephone

914
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,519
that she decided it wasn't necessary to
have a hearing

915
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:23,960
we took it all the way up to the US
Supreme Court and Justice John Paul

916
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,440
Stevens thought it was very

917
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,119
in a very interesting issue any refer to
the full court for hearing

918
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,960
but I didn't get enough votes so
unfortunately

919
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,369
the Supreme Court pretty much turned
their back on the case which happens to

920
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:38,150
a lot of people

921
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:42,680
so the first record i sat was the
longest held in pre-trial detention

922
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,809
the long is held without bail hearing
the first defendant to use a laptop in

923
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:48,699
prison

924
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:52,730
and the laptop was an interesting issue
because for my attorney to prepare

925
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,130
an adequate defense he needed access to
the evidence what evidence do you have

926
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,819
against my client

927
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:00,960
all computer-based evidence right

928
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,369
in my attorney was in the computer
expert not at the computer experts that

929
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:05,539
he found

930
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:09,640
were knowledgeable enough at the time to
really analyze and dissect the evidence

931
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:14,969
so he needed my help explain its him
what was important what was up

932
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:19,259
so he argued for years to allow

933
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:23,049
him his his assistant at the office and
myself

934
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:26,219
to be able to review the evidence
together the government

935
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:29,509
remember Christopher painter is now the
chief

936
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:33,049
see sips he argued to the judge if

937
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:36,980
you give mitnick a stand-alone computer
in custody

938
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,079
that he can and probably will write a
worm or a virus

939
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:44,529
and somehow its gonna find its way of
that stand on the laptop and wreak havoc

940
00:54:44,529 --> 00:54:47,680
upon the free world

941
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,329
not only their we believe that he could
engineer an escape

942
00:54:52,329 --> 00:54:56,750
with a stand-alone laptop and I'm
thinking to myself

943
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,900
how can we get away with us and faculty
punished or just came to mind

944
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,680
as I was so like I couldn't believe the

945
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,839
the excuses where the arguments that the
church's buy into something good

946
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,130
the judge anything or somebody somebody
with a credible background

947
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:15,269
somebody that's well known in the media
that she when to leave would be yessir

948
00:55:15,269 --> 00:55:19,690
or try to pull the wool over our eyes so
I have a friend

949
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:24,140
three where I I find your phone number
testy was here

950
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:29,368
night call information over the phone in
I didn't find a Steam account care

951
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:33,199
listed so I have a friend on a Sunday
morning freeway in the number I think

952
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,880
I'll call ask him maybe

953
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,680
be kind enough to come to court and
think it's up to judge straight

954
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,690
saw a I call the pit some a some

955
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:44,900
young young guy answered like I is Steve
there

956
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,680
they got on the phone in Ohio niggas all
its sunny morning I'm really busy can't

957
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,980
talk right now

958
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:54,640
and then I I felt embarrassed that was
bothering him so it is OK by

959
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,279
I and II hung up the phone so that was
why I guess first time that I met state

960
00:55:59,279 --> 00:56:02,329
I over the telephone so never

961
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:05,469
I was never able to find somebody that
would have been

962
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:08,960
credible I in the court eyes

963
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,969
so what ended up as I had a wave I've
put in the position

964
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:16,109
avoiding my speedy trial rights over and
over again

965
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:20,190
and how was put in a position is you
have a right to a speedy trial under the

966
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,369
Constitution

967
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:25,440
and under statutory law but a defendant
to waive that right

968
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,449
in the defendant has a choice meter to
trial

969
00:56:28,449 --> 00:56:32,920
with ineffective counsel but doesn't
have any sense of the evidence

970
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,910
or you give your attorney time to
prepare an adequate defense

971
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:40,420
and since my attorney had no access to
the discovery

972
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,839
I was put into the position where you
for what you could stand on your rights

973
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,828
mister mitnick go to trial immediately

974
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:49,480
you're turning us listen to the evidence
or gonna lose why wait my trial right

975
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,329
speedy trial rights

976
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:50,739
over No
