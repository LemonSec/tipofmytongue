1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,120
my name's Fred I drew the Big Brother
posters I'm doing an adaptation

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,590
in comic book format for a George
Orwell's 1984

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,590
order

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,740
I'm I'm benign and I'm responsible for
the arm and so

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,560
should you can blame Pune Paul

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,920
your I well at least

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,940
responsible for thinking all each

8
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,079
and idealize and

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,260
propaganda artwork they see hotel

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,180
or don't I work in my day job life as

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,300
designer and I work for advertising
people

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,440
corporations so I'm

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,670
propagandists and many was laszlo

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,000
I write and produce and host a
nationally-syndicated radio feature

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
called a technophile what's on

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,729
eighty radio stations nationwide as well
as XM Satellite Radio

17
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,999
om and I've also worked in advertising
age to work in an ad agency

18
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:14,420
I'm creating propaganda and find it out

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:21,420
you now how it's created public data is

20
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:29,409
everywhere I others all the

21
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:33,929
the mass media is very clever former
propaganda

22
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:38,049
%uh which is unlike the state-controlled
media

23
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:41,130
the former soviet regimes but

24
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,630
produces time new means obtaining some
the same goals

25
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,539
so you won't see a lot of things in the
mass media that they're not forbidden to

26
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,009
say

27
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,840
million don't say some kinda

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,789
great conspiracy up just this kind of
agreement that there's an acceptable

29
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,130
realm of discourse

30
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,339
from which we do not fear so

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,950
as we're talking about some the examples
a propaganda over the course of the

32
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,459
panel

33
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:10,829
I think it's important to keep in mind
that the

34
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:14,360
the most effective propaganda is the
stuff that we're not

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,390
about because it's just everywhere in
hand

36
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,650
I mean these these like these great
banners that we have around there so

37
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,819
obvious and their silly

38
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,040
and they're fun up but the Bud Light ads

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,828
block the windows on the on the
mezzanine like people don't think twice

40
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,439
about them so

41
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,750
so that's began I just first fred is
going to talk about

42
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,689
his comic work the comic book idea came

43
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:47,900
after watching a lot of TV yes

44
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,799
and

45
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,349
a I was adjust amazed boat what was
going on in american television for

46
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:57,010
smaller

47
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,518
may have to mention that I'm from Canada
so

48
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,510
we get a lot of lot of French TV you get
a lot of international news

49
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,450
that I don't see in the United States I
was here last year in New York upstate

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,680
watched just before the war started no
people or

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,269
down the streets protesting and I was
with the client know we were just

52
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,530
in for the TV and all we're talking
about the whole night

53
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,700
was this guy who wrote a book on how to
be cool they would like showing this on

54
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,249
repeat

55
00:03:29,249 --> 00:03:32,579
and there was this tiny little stream
under the TV

56
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,129
on said lotsa people protesting

57
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,159
New York City but they told the weather
several times

58
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,120
yeah might be was working so

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,349
and and yes oh

60
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:49,930
ninety-four's a book that hear about lot
in Canada

61
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,340
its mandatory reading some floss the
courses and C chip got there

62
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,659
so everywhere everyone around me had
already red

63
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,870
I just recently read it last year I was
amazed

64
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,049
but the similarities I saw in the book
compared to

65
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:08,219
what I seen TV when he seen the news
what I read on

66
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:12,689
newspapers and the Internet so I thought
in our

67
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,709
other people gotta read this you know
but I don't have the time to read it so

68
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,060
nobody has a time anymore is everybody
zones too busy

69
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,210
so I thought not heels to in comic book
form

70
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,258
notes easy it's quick and kids love it
eat

71
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,810
the markets so

72
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:37,630
well as some other process well first of
all I had to get some funding

73
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,500
don't pay the rent eat food and well
we're lucky in Canada galan

74
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,190
social programs and I applied for a
grant

75
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,259
and it was accepted so I can launch the

76
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,289
the project you know I've got like a
couple of months

77
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,479
good survival time to get a starting in
two

78
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,900
put it up get a couple of demos running
and try to find some magazines

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,919
and maybe a publisher Woodward wanna
take it up so if you know anybody

80
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:10,068
now I'm presently searching or publisher

81
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:13,319
is going to be in comic shops think
eventually I

82
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,550
I hope so definitely

83
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,160
you know where the the things about
propaganda

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,069
it like micro same the things you don't
hear a

85
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:29,610
had some amazingly frustrating times
with a gateway laptop

86
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,620
looks in the back three times over the
course two weeks and lost my temper on

87
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,590
the phone

88
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,849
numerous times and so I started to

89
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:42,580
talk about it on the air these short
technology news minutes that

90
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,849
are on the radio stations a talking
about how much gay wastes

91
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,650
sucks and I got a call from a radio
station

92
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,330
in Virginia that said dat to see you
know we're not airing the house

93
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,960
and as I can you know why people can
find them to be a little funny

94
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,039
because you know you us what you hear on
technology

95
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,729
technology journalism whatever's like
this is new cell phone and there's other

96
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,289
stuff that's really great and it's
expensive go by it

97
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:13,840
am so what so when I can go this is
ravished

98
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,270
and its its in quite annoying it and
they said you know gay we spent a lot on

99
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:18,530
my

100
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,710
spend some money advertising on the
stations sell anything that's not

101
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,990
not pro gateway we're not gonna run and

102
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,280
sy said you know whatever do what you
wanna do

103
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,789
awfully a few those people out there you
know would see me babbling about it

104
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:33,289
online

105
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:38,580
might website as well but its it's
things like that and

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,889
my when my good friends I'm is DJ for
the big rock station in Philly

107
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,039
om and I made he has me on the air like
every other day

108
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,909
I'm and I made some comment about

109
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:55,169
mumia and he ended it out and

110
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,219
he said there we've been told not to

111
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,289
say the word mumia on this radio station

112
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,568
and I said really and I mean this is a
rock station at the other place like

113
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:10,710
Metallica I'll cell I'd didn't think
those

114
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,409
a whole lot of for but you know really
socially aware folks listen to it anyway

115
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:16,599
but I am

116
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:21,169
sis commercial nonsense but he said that
the at CBS

117
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,359
had told the radio station to Billy
don't talk about me because when

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,520
the it you know if he actually does

119
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,780
get the death penalty in terms of you
know yet it does die

120
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,069
they think that bill is just gonna burn
down from the riots

121
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,150
and they don't want any part of it so
you can even talk about it

122
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,979
which is mindboggling to me

123
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,219
yes Pina censorship downstairs hit me

124
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:49,449
Ronald McDonald has been censored

125
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,310
yeah it was great couple

126
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,610
panic mode conference coordinators come
up to me in a day

127
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,159
and say we have to take your paintings
the front

128
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,330
said it's because millions like them

129
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,340
I know they're kinda cock now was that
the did the ROC government to condemn

130
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,789
the balkan take another one that I heard
complaints about

131
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,840
was the ass one which if any have you
seen said the top

132
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,349
squares right now it depicts an
astronaut

133
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:23,240
standing on planning planet Earth
holding upside-down flag

134
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,840
51 stars and apparently upside-down flag

135
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,599
is more upsetting then george bush Ron
MacDonald

136
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,000
makeup setting in France in Iraq flag

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,230
which is still up which is still up

138
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,550
well it's it's a it's in the lobby now
but that the one that was complaining

139
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,250
that

140
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,250
was the upside down black this is the
most

141
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,270
upsetting thing people in New York
walking the Huntsman

142
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,319
happening apparently the hotel was still
getting complaints

143
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,900
even after been taken down by people who
are so offended that I have ever been up

144
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,300
it i dont they were supposed to do about
this the site

145
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,610
get a time machine or something but to
so would like everyone not to mention

146
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,400
there ever was a poster with an upside
down flooded

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,910
you i think one other the big
transitions that that has happened

148
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,130
with propaganda is went

149
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,160
when I was as talk about this one time
accidents Italian

150
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Walter Cronkite was on the highlights my
career is talking to him

151
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,430
cuz he's amazing I'm what

152
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,330
when propaganda in the news

153
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,650
really begin to appear in in in my mind
is when it be

154
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,319
moved from I something that every
station had to do

155
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,370
was their duty as a station to have news
and they lost money

156
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,110
the news departments lost money the
transition from losing money

157
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,730
in the news department to making money
in the news department means that you

158
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,700
must target messages to a certain
demographic

159
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,970
whether it's forty-plus wealthy

160
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,790
whether it's extremely conservative
whatever when you begin targeting news

161
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,410
that means you begin filtering news and
when you're filtering news

162
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,459
you're creating propaganda because
you're only showing one side to the

163
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,960
story that you think that your
demographic wants to hear

164
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,000
it's like I was in Oklahoma visiting
relatives

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,860
a month ago and I was at a party and of
course

166
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,270
you know bush and and carry came up

167
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,210
we started talking about it and there
was a lot of things that

168
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,870
that it was is in the discourse that I
was bringing up that they never heard of

169
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,090
and I said you people

170
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,920
have to be watching Fox News net not
unlike this and I was like because

171
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,449
you know you haven't heard any these
things and bring in after like now

172
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,320
am sell you know targeted targeted news
i think is one have

173
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,010
I don't know how we solve it i mean
because you know you can't really bash

174
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,870
commercialism too much

175
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:52,540
I'm by its it's to the point where

176
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,099
you know when news became entertainment
its it's over

177
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,480
difficult problem because it's really
kinda art

178
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,090
looking at people sheep him and

179
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,890
what you have to do is figure out how
many people are gonna be looking at

180
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,410
whatever it is you're producing

181
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,860
and try to figure out what they want to
hear

182
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,110
and so when you're counting heads and
said dealing with

183
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,940
you now these are people with human
emotions well I got five thousand people

184
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,580
in this demographic

185
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,900
500,000 people in this demographic

186
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,990
then you have the problem dealing with
people's numbers which

187
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,440
is unavoidable I mean obviously this
there's so many people that you have to

188
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,610
group

189
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,990
and what's worse or what's better

190
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,700
depending on where you're coming from is
that it works it's very effective

191
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,120
like demographics stereotypes

192
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,250
everywhere and their true but I think
you got the sense that you can market to

193
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,520
you

194
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,569
a demographic you can market to
stereotype but I think the government

195
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,840
has to lead the way

196
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,170
I mean if you look at the if you look at
the BBC in where the amazing news that

197
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,000
they can actually

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,610
covering this thing shockingly and I'm

199
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,470
the be look at the BBC me. I think a
mandate on news

200
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,480
and has to come from the government

201
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,270
and there there was a mandate in this
country

202
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,939
all radio stations have to air public
service broadcasting

203
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,610
tomorrow morning if you're conscious
turn on the radio at seven o'clock

204
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,010
every radio station is bearings their
public service programming on Sunday

205
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,420
morning

206
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,449
every radio station in america because
Sunday morning is the lowest grade

207
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,740
de parte because everybody's hungover

208
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,790
when the you know methadone clinic or
whatever and

209
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,099
am sales the church same thing

210
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,540
it so they so they have so they

211
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,610
that's where they bury it and I think
that its

212
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,600
it there's a solution to propaganda and
you know actually getting

213
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,590
real news in all the information out
there has to be dictated by the

214
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,480
government because

215
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,700
if the commercial landscape is left to
its own devices

216
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,170
you're gonna get segmented and targeted
messages

217
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,880
did job is not to to inform

218
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,010
its to sell commercials I'm other hand

219
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,030
in the a.m I love it that's an
interesting claim you made by so that

220
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,530
the

221
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,310
that the government is to be the
purveyor neutrality right

222
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:23,100
I think the government should get out
propaganda

223
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,890
out but I think that it's the people who
have to regulate the commercial space

224
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:33,460
and like like this manner and here we
are media

225
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,890
this yeah even media plant

226
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,020
it's all about us and we all have voices
and we are the opinions and

227
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,020
the more people who are out there saying
their own stuff in

228
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,990
producing their own media that's how
you're going to regulate the commercial

229
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,480
space

230
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,380
and the government this is you know it's
a small group out

231
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,990
media and put bigger group but if the
government says they're

232
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,740
that one company can on 1300 radio
stations I mean

233
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,240
that's a huge government doesn't belong
in propaganda

234
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,520
now the government has to regulate media
somehow

235
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,100
I think the peak the people have to
regulate the media and the government

236
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,660
I mean thats wat the original setup was
right we're gonna have three branches of

237
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,310
government that regulate themselves

238
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,520
and a fourth branch made above the
people and the press

239
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,790
regulate those three but there have to
be rules I mean if you have one company

240
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,370
that owns thirteen hundred radio
stations the antithesis

241
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,700
that is that the government sets rules
that one company can only on

242
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,360
eight stations the something thus the
assumption you're making is that we have

243
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,630
corporations that on radio stations

244
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,670
Tom this corporations are of course a
total legal fiction

245
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,080
and we can change that system without
making the government

246
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,200
do it for us we can create alternate

247
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,040
and we do and we'll talk about this
better tomorrow

248
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,510
on a ban on in the media we can create
alternate

249
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,800
medio without the government's
permission without corporations

250
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,340
permission

251
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,500
that's the whole point checks and
balances and

252
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,300
its its its very productive to think
that either the corporation's control

253
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,690
the media or the government does

254
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,850
when there's obviously other means also
a return to a previous

255
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,780
point that was made this is kinda
assumption that a lot of people make

256
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,560
that

257
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,490
neutrality is is good or even possible
up

258
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,580
I've yet to see a a neutral newspaper
think if one existed

259
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,720
very boring but it would be

260
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,950
certainly very long if you wanted to
cover all sides view

261
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,970
there's all there's more that resides if
you read a newspaper article there are

262
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,320
there's

263
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,740
the person speaking and if the person
speaking as from the government

264
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,980
there's the opposing viewpoint I don't
know how many issues there are other

265
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,570
where there's only two viewpoints but
you'll read exactly two

266
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,370
every newspaper article %uh so this
notion of neutrality tell both sides

267
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,530
the story I don't think it works I think
what I prefers people who are up front

268
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,959
with their biases

269
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,710
newspapers and your by and large

270
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,460
have have identifiable viewpoints

271
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,200
read the such-and-such paper its I'll
alright

272
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,920
whatever and people know about that it
can take that into account

273
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,370
doesn't mean of course lie but a

274
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,770
this this notion that we can mute wrong
we must be neutral on this

275
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,490
serving the objective truth there's many
objective truth

276
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:27,640
and choosing which one is I think
something that

277
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,640
people should be aware that people make
conscious decisions

278
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,150
I disagree it and well then

279
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,990
it while Bieber what's the solution
everybody has an agenda

280
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:48,060
course but the Jersey come up front with
your gender so at the beginning my

281
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,290
article I should say

282
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,070
I am I I really hate the MPAA

283
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:58,190
so but here's a story about it sure you
could do that haha that's called the

284
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,680
features and journalism

285
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,510
up but but you can tell the truth
without for 10

286
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,520
without lying race Fox News other thus
like

287
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,079
giant ugly banner which i think is far
more fans have any john's work

288
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,270
over there this is fair and balanced on

289
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,250
and maybe they're on now with if you
consider balance like the republicans

290
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,470
and the people even further

291
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:26,470
writer I'm sure they're fair balance mom
I don't know

292
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,920
well but to us they're not fair balance
but some people they are

293
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,100
its objectives it said

294
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,980
to

295
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,920
that many it's a fact good

296
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,540
alright who is fair and balanced and

297
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,899
right well democracy now's not fair and
balanced a lot of my friends worker

298
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,060
termites in how they're very nice people
and they will tell you they're neither

299
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,970
fair nor write as many

300
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,970
they're not balanced

301
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,600
I agree I think the responsibility for
having fair and balanced information out

302
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,070
there's

303
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,270
in the reader I think it's your
responsibility to read different

304
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,580
viewpoints to read

305
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,730
you know the media sources that you
agree with

306
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,360
and the ones that you don't agree with
well I'm yeah I think that's it

307
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,250
what are the greatest things that ever
happened to getting other viewpoints as

308
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,760
is the internet I was being interviewed
honest

309
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,940
radio station during the war which I
guess for still

310
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:51,120
during the war whatever I'm and they
said you know what are you

311
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,140
would even check it out online lately in
a city not actually been

312
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,310
looking at Al Jazeera and I like what
you look at that stuff for a sec

313
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:03,750
well look at his at as many opinions as
you can and try to discern your own

314
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,250
your own thought process from there
because if you take one book

315
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,340
are one magazine are one Bible or
whatever and say

316
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,520
this is the key to everything in life
i'd I

317
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,700
I think you're setting up your own
propaganda filters okay

318
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,910
I think we're we're gonna opening up to
the ensena many actors

319
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,940
raise your hand CNN that sorta like
crazy

320
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,530
you know deterministic nonsense

321
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,310
okay will you can you can walk around
out soon

322
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:39,190
do do some work to do yeah I think

323
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,400
places RI I am

324
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,600
open it up Arthur yeah

325
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,270
because others they're attempting the
film this and basically on

326
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,280
on the film it's going to be like of
that for not

327
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,540
you're wrong sir her okay

328
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,080
looks area

329
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,270
is that on on I said

330
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,790
1984 are the copyright laws

331
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,610
you got permission to translate into a
cartoon

332
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,980
the question at George Orwell's work

333
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,610
is public domain in Canada Russia and
Australia right now

334
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,120
but I read on the internet that they're
trying to buy it up in Australia

335
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,850
so you might have to wait a while to see
it here

336
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,700
to lakes smuggling

337
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:42,700
with the cubans rising with each other
microphone

338
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,850
yeah hi I just wanted to come back to
what level said about the government

339
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,580
the government's been hijacked by these
corporate interests so

340
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,919
agree that that you have to be rules but
it's not the people who is setting the

341
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,520
rules

342
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,480
you know freedom in the press is belongs
to those who own the press

343
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,500
right so way we can counteract that

344
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,730
is somehow register the 100 million
Americans who are registered to vote

345
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,270
and maybe bring the government back you
know so it does represent what people

346
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,560
want and

347
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,060
be it's more diverse city in may be set
some rules that way

348
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,080
I i mean i created they disagree with me
but i i think the government

349
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,449
fundamentally has to set up some kind of
game planning

350
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,100
grid know but who is the government the
corporate in 20 right way

351
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,590
in the great is freedom of the press
right and

352
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,000
the whole point is that you know that
different branches are supposed to

353
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,990
regulate each other

354
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,410
and the press is supposed to report on
all this and regulate the three branches

355
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,010
so

356
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,520
that which ex announces means is when
one guy goes outta whack

357
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,610
other guys gotta come in and say you're
going outta whack it's time to fix this

358
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,970
rate so if the government and the media

359
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,090
are all outta whack then it's the people
and the media's responsibility to say

360
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,860
well who you're outta whack let's fix
this I also want to mention that

361
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,490
early American history the
government-subsidized

362
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,440
the Postal Service so that people could
send

363
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,360
newspapers out free or at a very low
price

364
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,020
and there with thousand newspapers all
over the United States

365
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,260
with very strong biases you know lease
we had a big marketplace

366
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,629
these and so I think there is a point
here too

367
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,700
you know government having an influence
you but I think

368
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,220
the we have to the attention to who's
hijacked the government we gotta get it

369
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:34,890
back again

370
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,640
and now they just give discounts at the
J Crew catalog eat

371
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,340
well the Internet is very cheap

372
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,580
cheaper than ever forget about postage
so

373
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,179
there's maybe some bold on and get back
to you know be

374
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,580
if if you've been the previous
conferences until the office as governor

375
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,820
about being the media

376
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,500
mean blogs as dopey as they are

377
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,590
I love going to one other be blocking
web sites at this point up a random one

378
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:09,040
and reading it's like to get my haircut
today Brian

379
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:13,659
am but some other some other ones that
are well done are spreading

380
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,380
knowledge and I think lot of times
people are more apt

381
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,710
pop around on those and share ideas and
opinions than they are to sit read the

382
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,520
NYTimes

383
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,230
home page laszlo you are commenting

384
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,480
on the whether government should be
regulating the media and that stuff

385
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,550
I think that can be summarized by two
saying that democracy

386
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:39,440
is conducive to capitalism but in return
capitalism is not conducive to democracy

387
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,890
I and I think I might be

388
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,510
stealing that quote from someone else um

389
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:51,520
Mike you're talking about down how

390
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,639
in some countries like its obvious that
people who

391
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,380
people who consume left-leaning media
are aware that people consume

392
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,000
right-leaning media are aware that and
in this country

393
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,650
what I've noticed is people who consume
left way

394
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,750
left-leaning media are very much aware
that the people who consume

395
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,990
right-leaning media think that its
neutral

396
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,700
and you know I mean how many times can
you repeat fair and balanced before

397
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,530
people start believing it

398
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,860
and that's the thing is that people who
watch people who

399
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,930
watch box is the primary news source
they don't consider it to be

400
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,870
right-leaning

401
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,430
they honestly believe that its neutral
and that

402
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,810
i think is the dangerous part where two
people just look at it and said

403
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,980
yeah it's it's right-leaning but that's
what I watch then it would be less

404
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,990
dangerous

405
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,810
my to say that the wrong means like all
these people believe it om

406
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:46,990
no I certainly have my biases I think
fox's like I'm watchable

407
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,380
om but but you know

408
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,860
there's as many viewpoints and you can't

409
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,930
inherently rejects any of them as
invalid

410
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,220
it's alright as stupid as they are
shouldn't

411
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,880
the there the strategy is repetition is
true

412
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,480
repetitions as ruler have I heard that
is true repetition repetition is true

413
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,700
so wished and so it's

414
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,240
in and that's like that certain the
strategy behind

415
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,850
any propaganda campaign whether it's
fair and balanced or whether its

416
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,760
left-leaning or whatever so

417
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,460
if you hear anything repeated too many
times it's time to start asking

418
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,330
questions

419
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,750
you know any terms their propaganda
posters

420
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,340
when we were doing research for this
conference and I'm

421
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,720
actually the SOM people in attendance
that help worked on one other at his

422
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,970
other 20 anniversary t-shirt

423
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,910
that is partially in Russian one other
designers

424
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,200
that shirt is in this over there Jamie

425
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,360
official goodness but when looking
through all that

426
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,240
all that stuff and looking at propaganda
posters from from days all these

427
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,980
really interesting and there's a guy
name i think is names Micah right

428
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:02,150
that's doing now the propaganda

429
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,920
remix project any takes old workable
posters and makes them

430
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,330
Apple to today's events insists on them
downstairs

431
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,240
yes right and I was talking to him

432
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,880
and what's really bizarre about
propaganda is when you go so far out

433
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,510
that people del see it because it there

434
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,740
to some of us the so blatantly obvious
making

435
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,250
you know and an ironic statement but he
will

436
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,290
have people come to his pages and send
them emails that are amazing to

437
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,550
reconnect absolutely agree

438
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:41,730
like right on man you know shut up
Downey by the doesn't believe us just

439
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,350
move out to the country

440
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,080
and and and it's so funny when you throw
something out there that's

441
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,870
kinda ironic poking fun and is in them
you know

442
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,970
is a is propaganda an obvious propaganda

443
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,620
but but people sees on it because they
believe the same

444
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,320
isn't trying to make a point about the
about government regulation

445
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,428
media we actually live in society right
now where the media is regulated by the

446
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:09,120
government

447
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,929
and I think part of the debate is really
the people being able to inform that

448
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,080
debate right now

449
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,530
media regulation is all about major
media controlling

450
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:21,970
Mesa policy this that busy the rules of
the SEC

451
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,530
you know the free market the that
they've set up to regulate them so

452
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,879
the people us we need to be able to you
to inform that

453
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,860
and you know it degrades to get rid of
government intervention

454
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,890
media gather but that's not a reality
right now so relates shipping a bounce

455
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:40,429
away from the mass media and those
control it to you

456
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:43,900
the people being able to actually
control the

457
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,000
that remark that agenda so I believe
there's a site Free Press that net

458
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,860
that is really big on me activism and I
would have incurred people check that

459
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,370
out

460
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,310
a lot about us localism and going to

461
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,570
because he's very assisi meetings
happening around the country where

462
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:03,460
with Michael how as

463
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,750
his finally buckled under to pressure
from like this

464
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,170
be surrounded year yes happen last year

465
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:14,490
in a free press that net and also as far
as propaganda goes I have

466
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,780
stickers that are very reminiscent of
that was putting them up

467
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,350
with that you're not putting I'm not
actually I don't know if these are the

468
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,120
same ones you're talking about but I'm

469
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,230
give you these me and now I'm

470
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,990
these are the ones with your the state
but you're usually accomplished

471
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,190
this he's wearing one of those

472
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,360
Nazi military to lighting bolts

473
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,660
capped his golf cap this is his

474
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,690
he's getting Hitler mustache I'd what's
interesting you

475
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,230
what's interesting about and yes the
ferry I forgot what the

476
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,950
what it is but it's like effect
discussion goes on long enough

477
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,040
somebody's gonna be compared to Hitler

478
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,570
what your endochondral

479
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,770
right so and it's interesting that

480
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,830
you know move on .org which is a clear
agenda

481
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,649
I when they had a contest where people
put together short films

482
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,960
anti-bush that bush in 30 seconds thing

483
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,660
that a couple of people brought up the
hill you know product comparisons

484
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,610
Hitler but if you go to the Republican
National Convention sigh

485
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,730
and the bush reelection campaigns
they're comparing

486
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,200
gore and other people carry and

487
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,780
neck and the whole group to Hitler
interspersing video from different

488
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,120
democratic candidates

489
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,610
with hitler's army I hit me with him
both sides I

490
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,030
equipment this is the text field

491
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,510
grr I think your argument starts get
lost as soon as

492
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,929
you start making references because it's
just so

493
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:48,030
field riders when you bring up

494
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,670
reminded me actually an anecdote which
is only tangentially

495
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,770
related but I'll sell it anyway other
Republicans are coming to town

496
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,000
unfortunately

497
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,020
month or so I and I i thought oh this

498
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,010
kinda fun to cover this convention for
26 magazine

499
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,310
I am so I went to this kind media
walkthrough I got it or

500
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,879
and I store the hotel Pennsylvania
occurs if the republicans

501
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,110
an so I I filled out the form for press
credentials

502
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:18,580
and there's this office somewhere in the
senate

503
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,879
why building which is in charge of media
credentialing

504
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,190
for the democratic and Republican
convention and their

505
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,260
they have this kind of arbitrary power
to decide who's me and who isn't

506
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,840
and I was told that if you work for a
quarterly publication

507
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,450
then you are not media and please don't
come

508
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,210
hours so there's time like arbitrary
division

509
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:45,179
who's allowed in who isn't they never
heard of crisis

510
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,130
magazine are some things so they just
kinda like reject this based on some

511
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,260
silliness

512
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,429
the independent media center on the
other hand was on the blacklist

513
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:56,880
and was told to talk to the secret
service as soon as they showed up

514
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,880
so out arbiter it's it's you know

515
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,120
especially you so

516
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,679
I get two things relating to move on the
first having to do with this commercial

517
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,260
on which is website arm so initially yes
there were two commercials that were

518
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,990
submitted to the bush in 30 seconds

519
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,120
our contest on one's website that made
comparisons to

520
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,970
bush and Hitler or you know the Bush
administration in the Nazi regime

521
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,720
on neither those commercials were
produced by move on they were produced

522
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,400
by independent individuals were
submitting to the contest

523
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,690
the one at the commercials had at the
end in order to save the people that

524
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,220
move on time should the

525
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,280
must be selected the word sponsored by
move on da toward

526
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,850
the video that interspersed Hitler in
the

527
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,510
commercial on bush's website is actually
the footage from that commercial

528
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,450
submission to move on website and so
what they're trying to do is

529
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,610
show OC with these democrats say about
to see how you know they

530
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,560
make these absurd contentions that were
like the nazis but the problem is the

531
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,320
majority people and how many future

532
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,939
how many here no you know what happens
with this whole move on controversy

533
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,380
with this commercial you know these two
commercials actually originally

534
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,530
appearing on

535
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,790
I move on website very few people
actually know about that so when you

536
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,129
actually see the commercial

537
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,240
you're getting this impression that
they're making a comparison to the

538
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:11,970
democrats

539
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,730
%um between the democrats nazis like
anybody who is aware a bit like

540
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,950
understands that they're trying to

541
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,640
make this you know not make that
suggestion but at the same time

542
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,550
anybody who is aware which is the
majority of the public is getting that

543
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,450
impression from

544
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,740
and so they're doing precisely with the
criticized Democrats for

545
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,810
great you know I'm confused already
you've just told me I've already

546
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,139
forgotten the exact details of who did
what

547
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,900
which is exactly what they want right it

548
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,240
on the second thing is our regarding
media ownership on there was another

549
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,800
incident

550
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,410
relating to move on downward I'll the
winner of the bush in 30 seconds

551
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,700
commercial contest

552
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,110
whispers Heather commercial aired during
Super Bowl and CBS refused to hear the

553
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,950
commercial

554
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,460
at that the reason they said that they
wouldn't have the commercial was because

555
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,100
they didn't wanna do any type of
political

556
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,400
ads during the Super Bowl meets on the
iran commercials from the Office for

557
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,870
National Drug Control Policy

558
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,870
and also a commercial from Boeing if I
recall correctly

559
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,740
so there was clearly like an agenda set
for who they would allow on

560
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,590
at the same time there's also another
thing they stopped they ceased a

561
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,429
the presentation at the reagans
miniseries that made you ronald reagan

562
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:14,400
looked very evil

563
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,030
wanted of to Showtime at the same time
buy.com CBS's parent company

564
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,250
I had a 30 percent stake in the national
market

565
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,270
which was over the FCC limit for what's
permissible

566
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,900
to the FCC try to pump up the media
ownership limits forty-five percent

567
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,010
and then you know concerned citizens
freaked out contacted the congressman

568
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,590
the senator said no way

569
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,840
you know like there should be like media
ownership over 35 percent

570
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,330
hell even over 25 percent and so
congress lower the level

571
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,740
and then what happened was I after the
Super Bowl the Senate passed through

572
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,330
attach the writer to another bill an
increase on the captive

573
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,640
39 percent to that viacom was able to
keep

574
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,990
I you know their share the national
market a tale what's really interesting

575
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,919
about

576
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:58,070
media ownership and censorship is at

577
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,520
I don't know if anybody here listens to
howard stern but aiight

578
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,800
it with all the cheerleading that he did
for the Iraq War II

579
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,880
never thought we would be where we are
today and

580
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,090
is seen this East as soon as he started
getting clamp down on by the FCC

581
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,629
air he was went out anti-bush

582
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:20,549
in Clear Channel shut it down Clear
Channel had been defending Howard Stern

583
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,210
left and right

584
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,418
they're making amazing money I on the
markets that he said

585
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:28,830
an eight flipped 180 degrees

586
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,569
not howard stern of in those markets and
then just said

587
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,220
you know that he's offensive have it was
right after he started going to get bush

588
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:40,690
and so now we've got howard stern who is
I

589
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,149
complaint center for a decade well but
who's complaining he's complaining about

590
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,359
Clear Channel owning all the radio
stations and how he's getting censored

591
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:51,609
meanwhile his show is responsible for
taking

592
00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:55,379
morning shows at their more morning
shows that have been fired nationwide

593
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,170
because they bring an issue now

594
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,450
took up a satellite dish in and and feed
him and

595
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,500
but I it's just such as such a bizarre
situation

596
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,140
that and and the republicans laughed it
off at first but I think

597
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,240
that they're starting to really see the
effect that that that howard stern could

598
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,640
actually throw this next election
because

599
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,060
let's talk about propaganda list which
show now in the morn it's not

600
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,460
it's like two percent you know lesbians
and ninety percent

601
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,490
screaming about the FCC censorship in

602
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,950
what's going on with his country it's
just bizarre yeah

603
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,430
it's a good point I mean if Howard Stern
is distracted from lesbians we have a

604
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,950
problem

605
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:36,620
right I want to make up on that

606
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,460
situation place in China much bars

607
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,839
you know they the government controls
everything

608
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,270
media control again Department

609
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,890
Andaman facing caught the Department

610
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,810
and ministry true

611
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,130
the people they are really don't have a
choice because like internet them

612
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,150
they blocked sites like that thought
call

613
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,680
watching times and the

614
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,049
they have TVs TV station like a

615
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,460
people watched like

616
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,780
BBC which is British what cast

617
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,720
cooperation and when BBC has some
reported on like this

618
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,550
dollars mission our satellite on that
channel holiday

619
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,670
and it's really really bad talk about I
radio

620
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,980
who sat on the radio over there you ppl

621
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,760
lit and we have friends went

622
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,200
when to China you with helping 25 set up
something like that and

623
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,240
jailed for three years US citizen

624
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,280
you know he's Chinese chinese-born

625
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,300
me with them for years

626
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,150
I'm either gonna start filtering text
messages to because they're afraid that

627
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,970
people are spreading

628
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:55,990
dissenting opinions by a technology has
been doing that all the time

629
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,220
you even if you can quit message this to
have a way to do it

630
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,589
so if you sent a text message to
somebody that says that the

631
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,839
to current parties Sox it that'll just
disappear to the either

632
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,040
it disappeared yeah well emails to and

633
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,170
website and proxy the clock block it

634
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:17,710
and you at like that though many are

635
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,700
network box in China and they have
surveillance system investing appears I

636
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,500
of

637
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,069
you F decryption the PS screen somehow
they can recognized

638
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:30,160
and this Salaam

639
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,670
good

640
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:36,710

641
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,810

00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,400
IQ is dropping quit plugin for anybody
listening

655
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,109

656
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:35,500
PDF so it's it's contact me 1984 coming
dot com

657
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,560
it was a great reminder that government
should

658
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,000
media regulation

659
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,390
I mean it's one thing to get your pain
taking out the front tell us anything

660
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,759
killed versace happen

661
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,250
let me what else can can can people do
do you think

662
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:57,430
terms if turning things around in China

663
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:02,660
doing is a trade sanctions is it what is
it

664
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,220
the they make okay and China

665
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,690
economy fast

666
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,120
I think

667
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,640
they don't have the concept with

668
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,640
the concept up

669
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,800
its like a when I was in college

670
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,090
I I read in a textbox from

671
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:36,390
text books like a yep talk

672
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:39,900
everything depends and all the time

673
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,150
and I was inspired by English textbooks

674
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:48,200
but island that I was like are in there

675
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,590
everything was calm you don't know
anything

676
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,400
same

677
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,700
today the its look the part look like

678
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,690
more all a steal the way the ed

679
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,960
people the way they controlled by mine
its

680
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,400
both I think that's the only place left
in the world

681
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,500
before Russian now

682
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:21,500
only world best deal has touchdown

683
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,869
it's really bad

684
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:27,840
well hopefully it'll turn around at some
point I think hong kong by

685
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,090
might be an issue that makes

686
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,110
change their now think on Kong's gonna
go down without a fight

687
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,180
that's so

688
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,440
thank you

689
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,140
lou

690
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,319
make well two questions really

691
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,310
this person is I wanted with we could
expand on the way propaganda as opposed

692
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,070
to censorship

693
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,380
so if I went to the message used to hear
what you have to say about propaganda

694
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,210
when I was

695
00:40:56,210 --> 00:41:00,270
16 in high school my English teacher
she's gonna jim DeMint

696
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,740
here this thing was to try and educate
assess the definition a propaganda

697
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:09,690
and she said things like propaganda is
when they take a complicated issue make

698
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,990
it very simple black-and-white

699
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:14,190
comp propaganda in a they take it

700
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,390
complex social dynamic and turn it into

701
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,710
you know his name you know like turning
things into

702
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:25,869
any next thing or auspices damn thing
and propaganda is when they take

703
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:26,589
something

704
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:29,990
you know political and turn it into a
very personal

705
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,150
you know individual person Mike I that
the leaders in individual as opposed to

706
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,970
huge state apparatus or the the person

707
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,150
who perhaps represents you know like

708
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:44,710
some poor bosnian mother with the baby
in her arms and

709
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:49,540
no like to or on you know you know that
the marine having

710
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,220
it cut off is very very emotional and
it's very very individual

711
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,470
and you know obviously both sides doing
their propaganda

712
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,250
but its that's what propaganda is as
opposed to

713
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,560
units in ship not citizenship as well so
I wondered if you guys could expand on

714
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,849
that

715
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:12,060
you have any comments but house on I
think it's difficult accepted

716
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,869
discern what the difference between
propaganda censorship is a mean if

717
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:19,740
if if a new station is now reporting the
full truth about iraq

718
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,310
as they want to keep you know somebody
bedded away or whatever I mean is that

719
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,000
censorship urs a propaganda

720
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,200
listenership to cook the two sides
calling

721
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,300
kinda I mean property and is

722
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,410
course active part going out expressing
an opinion

723
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,118
course withholding opinions me people
can express their

724
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:46,010
opposing opinions is right to send when
I was

725
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,329
when I was taught propagandize
propaganda unit in my eighth grade

726
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:50,300
English class

727
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,670
and beaten what they taught us

728
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:57,290
which I'd later when I became fascinated
her in collagen

729
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,520
dropped out wasn't logical fallacies I

730
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,800
I guess my eighth-grade teacher kinda
mixed up but what

731
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,069
wat we covered in that you was things
like that ad hominem attack

732
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:13,910
strongman attack in basically these are
ways

733
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,170
approaching an argument the XOR

734
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,329
different methods techniques that you
can use

735
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:23,720
to direct people's attention year here

736
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,760
right let's talk about this let's start
this kind

737
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,930
argument and censorship is

738
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:35,500
wanted us so what you can do when you
want to spread your opinion

739
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,599
is say this is my opinion these guys are
liars

740
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,810
or these guys have a battered these guys

741
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,900
you know United so I think he's really

742
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,230
I think you know sometimes talk about
the good old days media and

743
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,619
and you know perhaps a little days there
were some rules upstand discourse that

744
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:56,310
you weren't really allowed to do the ad
hominem attack and %um you know

745
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:59,109
whereas nowadays it seems like anything
goes and I think that's interesting can

746
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:00,460
I get my pic can

747
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:03,760
yeah clippings or another time but it
can wait appoint om

748
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,780
if you if you when dancers in the movie
room last night you saw some

749
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,500
North Korean property and very it's very
silly

750
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,970
I mean there's like these people million
people marching through this

751
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,079
streets of Pyongyang to celebrate the
fiftieth anniversary

752
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,180
great dear leader whatever they do in
Kyle

753
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,629
and that one works here I because were

754
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,720
were more savvy up so I think

755
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,960
banana hours worked hard it would it
would

756
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,329
marge is it was just his other day it's
a totally absurd

757
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:39,619
but so it's or more savvy than that but
them

758
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:43,540
the the propaganda some our server then
that too I mean so they they come it was

759
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,569
tough but does work

760
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,779
and the goals and methods are largely
the same even if

761
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,089
it doesn't fit into like the three
simple rules for determining propaganda

762
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:52,180
the first which is

763
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:57,770
is no simple rules something we get the
next question is about Louis next

764
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,450
question is with

765
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:01,880
if I hear love people who is talking
about you know be the media and and

766
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,140
and i'd I do believe in you know the
internet as the way around all the

767
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,470
censorship the problem is

768
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:10,800
that you know it and I work within the
media with alternate media and the

769
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,599
problem is that

770
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,099
you can I don't think anybody in

771
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:18,550
in this room within for instance invest
money based on something they read that

772
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,200
someone had posted on the intermediate
so

773
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,580
because you don't have you don't have a
condo deception up the accuracy of that

774
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,310
whereas

775
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,849
I mean I don't know obviously it's all
relative but this whole post Mon kinda

776
00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:31,260
believe that everything is relative but
there's no

777
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,150
workflow you know amongst the Internet
as a whole to

778
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,400
find a way whereby we can we can
evaluate whether someone's

779
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,810
just making shit up because people make
shit up all the time and you get these

780
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,210
rumors on the internet

781
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,970
and we never gonna be the media that
anybody's gonna trust into we can find a

782
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:47,330
way

783
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:52,130
and we have to say I think in a way to
make make it possible to discern

784
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,260
someone is making shit up from someone
who's a really hard-working reporter who

785
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:55,890
went

786
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:00,029
and interviewed the widow and you know
found out the spec conduct this up and

787
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,170
can be trusted so it so much

788
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,540
the New York Post make sure there's a
look I'm in the car with my cover the

789
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,640
other day with that

790
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,640
carry had selected someone else as vice
president again

791
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,319
you get with commercial media yeah if
you can have your propaganda filters up

792
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,710
with about anything online but I

793
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:24,520
me think where things up in the media
whether it's with the blog if you're on

794
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,700
the radio or

795
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,150
creating sound for video game whatever
you're doing is just throw some stuff

796
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,030
out there that makes people think

797
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:34,609
cuz that you can throw acid is a people
all day long but if you get one now

798
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:37,009
getting further had that they go
investigate

799
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:41,200
I they can go make up their own mind to
people needed makeup

800
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,859
trusted media sources who ask you to go
check their references

801
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:48,330
to answer the question directly yes I do
think it's possible to create

802
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,540
democratic structures accountability I
am

803
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:55,640
it you know the the the newspaper put 0

804
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,400
by the next independent media center
which I guess we'll talk more about

805
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,589
tomorrow

806
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:02,609
a you know there's editors and they
check fax and

807
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:07,049
there's people I trust to check fax I

808
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,740
but the you know it but do it without
the corporate structure and

809
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,349
you know doesn't mean after believe
everything you read

810
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:19,130
let's get to the next question smart
people the media talks a lot about

811
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,140
were the hearts and minds people

812
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,670
and i think thats that speaks a lot
about propaganda how much

813
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:31,290
disinformation again in other parts of
the world as well as

814
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,799
in our own country so me being a
technically minded person I get really

815
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:36,790
frustrated

816
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:40,540
bosko's have a meeting about how they're
too many meetings at our company

817
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,759
you men's I just want to get it done and
see

818
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,410
defect get fixed and on I get so
incredibly frustrated

819
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,180
with the way that our country works
which is why things like Jen's artwork

820
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,220
is so appealing

821
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,810
when I see it yes this is exactly what
I'm feeling

822
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,859
by 10 Jan as an artist how do you feel
when

823
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:02,830
other people on the street go by in
their their offended by it

824
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,920
they're not like no this is how I'm
feeling there they're like takedown

825
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,430
it %uh Jennifer briefly as electors were
just about all I make I think it's

826
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,919
hilarious

827
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,020
um a if you saw these paintings they say
on the top

828
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,319
this is not propaganda right I mean
irony is already here and when to me cuz

829
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:22,130
brian says

830
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,290
your sign of distress offends me the
irony

831
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:29,069
levels just kill him to the top so

832
00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:32,790
I mean yes it's unfortunate that lets
people get to see it but I think it's

833
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,140
a sign of the times it's a sign that
exactly what I'm doing

834
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,118
is its typical if they didn't ask to
take it down then they would have been a

835
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,520
very good post exactly

836
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,410
exact awesome thanks everyone for coming
we're out of time

837
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,710
