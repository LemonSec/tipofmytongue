irony ok am ready

31

too much time between sessions

32
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:11,730
a hurdle that span come from well I'm
gonna talk a little bit about all this

33
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,238
stuff

34
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,459
hamon hamon you hear Billy get a lot of
spam how many who would like to see

35
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,239
spammers

36
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,370
drawn and quartered and hung up on the
tower London for 30 days

37
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,660
third act okay we might be happy to know
that over the over the last month

38
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,349
maybe year year and a half I've been
there I've been one of the leading at

39
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,720
persons

40
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,510
in the war against spam and spammers and

41
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,540
it all got started about two and a half
years ago when I had a

42
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,000
my own web hosting company Web crunchers
and

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,670
I basically offer email services and
also web hosting services

44
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,040
and over the past %ah two years

45
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,269
spammers found out about my server at
the time I was running Mac OS 9

46
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,049
but that he IMS mail server from you
Dora

47
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:04,680
and that's not a very secure mail server
let me tell you for spammers found out

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,010
about it NewsCore stay a

49
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,040
day spam through my network and I one up
on just about every black oldest you can

50
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,608
imagine

51
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:15,400
so I pretty much gave up on using shop
IP for mail anymore Sodor

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,049
and a lot on my our customers bailout
for shop I P like rats

53
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,139
leaving a sinking ship so %ah

54
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:27,519
in love the fact that it had the web
countries up for fifteen years

55
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,950
have had about 150 emails in existence
for fifteen years

56
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,569
a they've been collecting the life span
they wound up on many many CD-rom's

57
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:42,660
spammers selling and of course my users
effort started using many more

58
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,760
so about a month ago I a took out that
Apple

59
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,620
and put in an OpenBSD box and

60
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,299
a really robust server on a really fat
type and

61
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,680
now I'm able to offer much better mail
services

62
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,370
and one of the things that I've been
doing is I've been basically studying

63
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:02,979
spam

64
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,989
are one of the things I wanted to talk
about

65
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:11,579
is early origin a spam got back in the
old days were open gateways

66
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,959
likes them before 1995 and

67
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,380
ISP's in spammer friendly countries
China Russia casa Rico and Brazil

68
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,790
inadequacy got spam proxies which are of
course

69
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,160
not too often used

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,259
and the current origin a span now is
still offshore mail gateways mostly in

71
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:32,780
China

72
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,660
but eighty percent if it comes from
infected hosts

73
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,940
that's right people who do real stupid
things like

74
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,340
opening up catchments and getting them

75
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,440
cells infected with a virus or a proxy

76
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,759
and that virus goes out there and phones
home to a secret server

77
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,750
secret server download to a Trojan into
the machine

78
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,870
and currently right now in the best
estimate I believe there's proximately

79
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,080
500 thousand to 750,000 infected hosts
out there on the internet

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,520
well he's infected hosts the course are
being controlled by a small

81
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,859
group for people mostly spanning gangs

82
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,259
operating at it Eastern Europe I've
tracked down quite a few myself

83
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,570
and through a number have

84
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,340
I might say spam spies have been able to
infiltrate into their system and learn a

85
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,740
lot about how they all work

86
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,639
a the myth that the the favor choice of
spammers

87
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,050
is but we called the for tacking
basically this means

88
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,060
writing an IRC bot which which can be
executed from

89
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,150
anybody joining a channel and it
basically tells

90
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,380
a our it connects to any other server
which is a master controller server

91
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,159
that master control server then
communicates to

92
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,949
a number previously selected infected
hosts

93
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,460
they don't like to use is infected hosts
all at once the use them

94
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,859
little at a time in hopes that they
won't be discovered

95
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,310
so they usually turned off a lot of the
more sophisticated spammers and hackers

96
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,470
who uses infected hosts use a

97
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,160
rather interesting way hiding

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,050
the fact that the machines infected and
this is done through what they called

99
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,850
knock knock

100
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,040
principal way this works is normally the

101
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,210
listener is turned off so when you do
port scan show up

102
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,420
it's totally invisible however if you
send it syriza

103
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,090
specially crafted paintings with special
part numbers in a certain sequence

104
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,360
well guess what you open up a port
listener activates and you now can

105
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,600
control that proxy that then becomes a
master controller proxy

106
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,139
it and controls all the rest so it's
almost virtually impossible to catch

107
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,310
this kind of level is spamming

108
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,340
and hacking me sir how the DDoS attacks
it happened as well

109
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,580
does anybody have a question okay %ah

110
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,530
so let's talk a little bit yeah

111
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,780
%ah mostly high speed internet users are
mostly the winter

112
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,110
there they're prone people either
machines on all the time in to have DSL

113
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,030
or cable modem in

114
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,450
and and you do really dumb things a
leader machine on

115
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,580
and the doc patch their machine and then
there's this new recent fires

116
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,060
out problem with the IE Internet
Explorer

117
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,580
where you visit our web site near
infected just by visiting a website so

118
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,960
mean as lot smarter ways these things
can be infected

119
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,750
let's talk a little bit about spamming
in general first thing is a chain

120
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,950
responsibility

121
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,760
only kinda explain that the company has
a product to sell

122
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,500
the company contact some type a mass
marketing company

123
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,990
the mass marketing company basically
outsources their work to

124
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,330
smaller companies for resellers

125
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,310
and they maintain and monitor their own
list or they can also get a list

126
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,220
from the actual company if that company
has a website

127
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,290
and if they have a website that I

128
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,960
that as a web site that basically asks
for people

129
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,080
for information for product information
me see what you want product information

130
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,280
fill out this form and we'll send you
something

131
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,490
and though often it often think that if

132
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,540
somebody's interested in a product that
gave the go and now that person to the

133
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,169
mailing list these are clean mailing
list by the way

134
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,719
these are people that are already opted
in and then of course they

135
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,310
they passed this onto the mass marketing
company which outsource it to

136
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,510
other people who tend to actually use
spamming and the out

137
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,250
the marketing company can be anywhere in
most cases it's in China

138
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,940
sometimes in eastern europe and out

139
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,149
so basically the Sony companies already
two levels removed from the spammer

140
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,740
making it really difficult to nail
spammer

141
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,290
in the best way is to go after this
amber ties website owners

142
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,260
and the beneficiary span

143
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,810
the mail trail pretty much dead and
trace the mail headers and find out

144
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,540
where the spam come from you can pretty
much guess is gonna come from some

145
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,399
infected

146
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,649
host and that's about as far as you can
get

147
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,010
and of course the ISP talking to tell
you that is because they've got privacy

148
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,199
policies they have to respect

149
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:14,519
spammer ties web sites also have no
contact information

150
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,350
but they have often have 800 numbers or
Forms page

151
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,570
for sucking in sectors that are wanted
by the wanna buy whatever they're gonna

152
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,579
knock out and sell

153
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,180
are registered to make contact info is
often falls in bogus

154
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,440
so he can really use domain ownership
and

155
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,360
who is to find the location of a spammer
most the

156
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,649
domains and in .biz are often in Custer
Rica

157
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,220
and often these these are registrars and
registries domain names don't really

158
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,769
give a hoot about whether the
information is accurate or not sexually

159
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:47,230
not a

160
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,990
good way track it down but the best way
is follow the money trail

161
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:55,040
yes go up by when these things that they
sell

162
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,620
look at your bank statement afterwards
find out what the bank years

163
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,000
contact the bank claim fraud do whatever
you have to do to get the information

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,230
and pass it on to the authorities and
you can pretty much get really close to

165
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,940
the spammer that way

166
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,100
and if they ship something to you can
also follow the shipping trail look at

167
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,980
the shipping label on your package

168
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,889
I know where it was shipped run okay
span gangs

169
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:24,180
yeah run that these guys spend gangs are
are an interesting lot

170
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,410
I to give you an idea let me see if I
can

171
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,760
show you a sample male here

172
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,980
in my I

173
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,140
my spam to investigate folder

174
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,199
well thats doing its thing I'm gonna go
back over here

175
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,200
to my presentation and go back to that
later

176
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,040
span gangs well I found I found spam
gangs basically

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,120
basically by accident one other
interesting things that I worked on

178
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,480
is when i send out an email to anybody

179
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,730
anybody that I know I have a hash code
built in a day

180
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,700
email I can stand my email being crunch
shop I P dot com

181
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,220
my email really is crunch 9364 chop I P
dot com

182
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,950
9364 as a random UT number that's
assigned

183
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,010
when I compose a new message to somebody
so if I send a message to somebody for

184
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,240
the very first time they get assigned a
number

185
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,720
uniquely identifies them so when they
send the mail back to me

186
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,730
I know where it came from he goes off in
tattle tales and tell somebody asked

187
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,089
what my email addresses

188
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,029
and that person start using my email I
can trace back the original personally

189
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,010
gave the email to

190
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,140
if a spammer finds out where my email
addresses

191
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,600
by know exactly who gave that email
address out I could go after the person

192
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:53,950
say

193
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,029
shame on you for doing it we hear
something else that done

194
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:00,209
for a while I can opting out as spam

195
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,510
just to see how effective it is and

196
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:09,079
well I found out some really interesting
things I found out it yes indeed some

197
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,730
time talking out does work

198
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,779
and on other times when I opt out all
the sudden

199
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,839
when I opt out I take that that that

200
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,279
task code it's built in the email
address and I i lock it into a database

201
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,930
so now when I get email from a spammer
see if it's

202
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:33,930
ready

203
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:38,319
having my emails kinda messed up some
reason now

204
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:44,060
don't worry about right now so when it
when I actually send it to a spammer

205
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,009
I the ESB amor goes ahead and gives out
that email address with that funny

206
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,110
looking coat on and I was gonna actually
show you

207
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,110
some sample emails from I some spammers

208
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,079
have gotten with this number on it and
it's not just one

209
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:04,000
it's twenty or thirty so I can I prove
beyond a reasonable doubt yes indeedy

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,949
spammers to sell your email address out

211
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:10,360
II can prove that I so

212
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,610
reporting spam yeah yeah well we don't
own any way that I went out and proved

213
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:16,959
it

214
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,060
span gangs okay spending is a
well-funded

215
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,680
mostly in Eastern Europe and the mostly
are the ones that are cranking out the

216
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,930
viruses and exploits for instance the

217
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,339
so big Paris was probably had developed
by a

218
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,699
Russian hacker somewhere out somewhere

219
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:38,139
that was paid pretty high dollar from
the Russian Mafia

220
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:43,139
which often is used to fund spam
operation mostly for their porn sales

221
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,220
and what they do is they offered what
they call

222
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,620
bulletproof hosting how many have you
gotten an email message

223
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,730
touting and claiming bulletproof hosting

224
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:59,360
well guess who's hosting Orser it won't
be a regular survey won't be sitting in

225
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,920
some

226
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,189
box on some colocation facility actor
sure you that

227
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:06,990
it'll probably be Aunt Jemima is
computer that you happen to like to

228
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,449
leave on the screen saver it's her
computer that's hosting all that's spam

229
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:10,839
mail

230
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:15,439
or could be the church group leader from
they know but that's who's hosting most

231
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,329
most to the span I did this by actually
tracing through

232
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:23,019
a a one particular one is called

233
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,500
cordoned tower dot com forward slash

234
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:33,379
something colon and its 3116 you
something like that that's the port

235
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:34,040
number

236
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,620
that you specify so it doesn't use port
eighty

237
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,379
it doesn't use any these other ports
uses an iPod port number

238
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:45,209
and they've got a little web server
running on their on their machine

239
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:49,380
they don't even know about along with
all the porn on their machine as well

240
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,709
in this was done and not discussed this
was

241
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:56,350
done through the use a infected hosts

242
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,569
and with the current a job situation
like in this country

243
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:04,420
all outsourcing going on a lease program
is at work somebody comes up to you and

244
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,939
offer you thirty five thousand dollars
by the virus

245
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,290
in your about four months overdue in
your renter car payments what are you

246
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:10,959
going to do

247
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,519
yes well there are people of course it
do had desperate needs

248
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,040
and no doubt they were often

249
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,230
recruited to do these kinds of things so
we

250
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,839
with 11 from with headline infiltration
in these mailing lists I have a lot of

251
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,319
people in russia that but I mean

252
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:32,439
90 II and very familiar with eastern
europe in Europe myself to travel there

253
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,149
many times in a lot of friends

254
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,559
in yugoslavia Bulgaria and Romania

255
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,250
and as well as Russia and also

256
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,509
ukraine and of course lots a German
people to

257
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:47,610
so I'm very familiar with these people
and I i I

258
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,420
and I can even read Russian so I have no
problem going into the Russian web sites

259
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:51,959
to

260
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,149
to learn what they're doing what they're
saying and

261
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:59,759
so this is sorta wanna things I've done
reporting span

262
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,089
I highly encourage you to report spam my
problem with reporting spam it's very

263
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,279
time consuming

264
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,370
several ways you can do it you can do it
the easy way since signing up perspire

265
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,600
for spam cop it's a good way to do this

266
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,420
but again it takes a lot of time to set
that up in to get in to report

267
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,610
and you can get free reporting or you
can get your you can pay for the

268
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,149
reporting

269
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,379
and it's about to a it's about a dollar
a megabyte

270
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:28,319
spam so if you wanna report fifteen
megabytes spam it's gonna cost you 15

271
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:28,910
bucks

272
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,589
so that's roughly what the spam cops
prices are the advantages paying versus

273
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,019
not paying is pretty simple

274
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,689
if you're not paying stamp app which is
think all the next screen up there

275
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:42,420
it's a built in 15-20 second delay so
makes it very

276
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,059
inconvenient when you really want to
report a lot of spam takes very time

277
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:46,699
consuming

278
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:50,959
the next thing of course is

279
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,980
what I is what you'd want to do
reporting

280
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,980
and the reason why I wanted to reporting
is the fact that you can point out which

281
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,049
where he's infected hosts are

282
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:03,720
they're actually telling you where they
are if you have a lot of spam sources

283
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,429
you can go and get exactly all these
infected hosts and of course this is

284
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:09,230
Kenny

285
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,990
I and if you don't have much to report
no problem is going to spam

286
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,409
country we've done it we've been working
on it very aggressive spam reporting

287
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,919
I have a patented system right now takes
an IP address a male

288
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,439
and it returns back a email

289
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,919
up the ISP with that mail came from so
in other words if this mail came from

290
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:31,710
Comcast

291
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,270
net Comcast dot com whatever they're
called

292
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,309
I take this IP and

293
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,678
I A I am I have a way of taking that I P
and converting it into a

294
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,580
into an email address and what I do is
to have a very very large collection

295
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,000
span in an in NM box format

296
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,090
I'll show you some in just a minute and
the sandbox

297
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,750
format it spam will then allow you

298
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,120
to I to send this to the spam reporter

299
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,139
spam reporter does two things it takes
it breaks up into two different sections

300
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:11,899
the first section spam that it can ring
you can find the act you can find the

301
00:18:11,899 --> 00:18:14,190
e-mail address out from the IP address

302
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,639
and of course is always going to be some
spam you can't find the IP address at

303
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,860
so it breaks up into bat spam and good
span

304
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,340
that's spam generate a list as IP
addresses

305
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,790
this list IP addresses and fed into
another program

306
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,970
goes out there and does who is on the
database

307
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,620
for that IP address and generate a file
not unlike

308
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,700
this file right here bring it up real
quick

309
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,500
let's see you go to my database

310
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,809
and it would look something like this:
%ah this particular file here has an IP

311
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:50,889
block caller with the

312
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:55,120
phone with the the property email
address where to send the spam from

313
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,030
and on this is generated in a very cool
way its automatically generated corks

314
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,760
it does who is term is the the IP block
the reading the

315
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,299
objects at a WHOIS record yet does a
really good job trying to guess what it

316
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:11,059
is an abuse contact the night if there
isn't abuse contact

317
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:15,139
tries it assumes are is one goes out and
actually try snake could make an email

318
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:16,630
connection to abuse

319
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,899
and essential probe message the probe
message is something to this effect

320
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:24,470
hi which we're getting spam from your
network we would like

321
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,679
we would like to know if this is the
right place to send it and I'll come

322
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,639
back with the report

323
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,100
into the connector port then went to
know if this is a good good email

324
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,470
very often of course I get bogus email
addresses because be

325
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,299
going with air n at Nick and the like to
these other registry systems

326
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:43,720
to find that the information in there is
often outdated an old

327
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,750
so what the spam report does it actually
will send

328
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:52,820
a report to the effing so let me %uh
Francisco through here

329
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:59,820
and I'll find say ethnic

330
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,570
here's one down here this 106 1.0 66

331
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,710
comic info at Epic died at that right
there

332
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,330
is had got that IP addresses god though
this WHOIS information

333
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,080
but when I when I say info an epic
dotnet what it does it sends a bogus who

334
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,059
is report

335
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,418
to the apt that net in request a a
tracking number

336
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,730
so it automatically does this so
whenever there's a spam it can't

337
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,570
determine what the IP addresses it does
that

338
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,370
now if it's a big IP block I can also go
through the looking-glass server

339
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,510
and extract the extract information on
the upstream provider

340
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,629
and I could have sold them if I really
want to so this

341
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,370
for what the database sort it looks like
in in one form

342
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:49,370
or another k going back to my slides

343
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,919
very aggressive spam reporting well the
very aggressive spam reporting in our

344
00:20:56,919 --> 00:20:59,820
survey do it right need databases IP
blocks verses

345
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,009
you support emails which has shown you I
can report up to 8,000 span today

346
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:08,809
from our users with our service service
they offer for us

347
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,859
for our people on my network an
automatic the airport spanner in the

348
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:14,049
report twice a day

349
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:17,570
so I do it into block so about 4,000
spans each

350
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,918
it's resulted in the shutdown
approximately 150 thousand infected

351
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,989
hosts per month not too bad

352
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:27,070
so we are causing we are being a real
thorn in the side

353
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,189
spammers as is causing a very severe
headaches and running out at these hosts

354
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,989
very fast how do I know this

355
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,809
I know this because I'm actually spying
on the spammers network by going into

356
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:37,809
their chat channels

357
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,509
and hearing what they have to say about
it their parts are

358
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,329
are sent within minutes getting are
newer system when we get it implemented

359
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:47,779
is going is going to incoming filter

360
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:51,259
the way that works is when spam comes in
it it's

361
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,349
filtered to be span if the filter
actually detected if it's indeed span

362
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:59,458
and but it does it immediately sent
report back within

363
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:03,369
thirty-seconds getting the mail so the
ISP can get in real time

364
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:08,689
indication that this spammers active and
ISP's subscribe to our service

365
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,399
can shut down the infected hosts almost
immediately so we're getting

366
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:17,269
we're getting almost real time span
shutdowns up the system now

367
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:22,009
and so here's a nasty things you can do
to spammers

368
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,379
okay let's say you have a a mortgage
spammer

369
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:30,320
any sense you a Anna an email address

370
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,908
and got a website in you go to the
website and usually

371
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:37,659
mortgage spammers are the best ones that
really pecan a gotta

372
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,549
Forms page it requires you to send in
your address

373
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:45,579
phone number your email and all that
stuff so you fill out the form stage

374
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:46,969
summer fields are required

375
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:50,219
others are but I do a sec take that
forms page

376
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:54,429
HTML that forms page and a copy that to
my own server

377
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:57,749
well the action tag

378
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:00,929
in a Forms page contains the CGI calls

379
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:04,200
which get called when you fill out that
form spate

380
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,309
instead of me putting in their CGI
action from I put my

381
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:11,690
own CGI action form in at two buttons to
the web page

382
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,229
when button years mass mass

383
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:19,479
a I can I can call it like multiple
submissions or whatever it is

384
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:22,710
and then another button is just you know
I

385
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,969
a figure with your button was when I
used it for but that when you click on

386
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,549
that and what happens is

387
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:31,668
a it doesn't go to their CGI goes to my
CGI

388
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:36,139
my CGI then goes to the Forms page
submits the form stage

389
00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:39,429
but instead at me instead it go into

390
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:42,649
so when I do is to take the the action
tag

391
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:46,899
and then I send the Actiontec through my
server so makes it look like as if I'm

392
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:49,339
actually going in filling in that forest
page

393
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:53,839
but this point does it automatically and
I've got a huge database a bogus email

394
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,829
addresses in

395
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:59,599
and bogus to addresses and I could just
want their server with thousands and

396
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,158
thousands of reports per minute

397
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,919
and its DNA can you know and of course
you've got to be careful you don't do

398
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,279
anything illegal so you wouldn't want to
do it too often

399
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,159
so I put a look delay in there you know
maybe one or two seconds

400
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,729
up well

401
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:18,019
suffice it to say that really got their
attention

402
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:22,440
the next day I got back I met an email
message because when I did was

403
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,909
I actually was using my honey pot email
addresses the crunch

404
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:30,129
8263 at whatever those email addresses
Rachna throwaway lines

405
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:32,979
they were sending me back email
addresses on the same thing why are you

406
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:33,779
doing its

407
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,450
and I said where you stand be

408
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,649
so in this works most the time

409
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:45,039
however it depends on how they've
implemented their pages now we're

410
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,309
getting a little lighter

411
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:49,678
and their preventing you from doing that
because what they do is a check to refer

412
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,299
to

413
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:53,729
and it's the reefer isn't the same as
your your

414
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:57,679
original page 2 mission than they could
probably block you it depends on how

415
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,719
they wrote the PHP code it did their

416
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:03,739
web page and so I and also what I do is
act

417
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:07,579
let the mailing list with bogus email
addresses and placing their list

418
00:25:07,579 --> 00:25:11,619
and that's when my favorite ones too and
and I just

419
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:15,749
and I just do as much as I can just give
damn as many email addresses are

420
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:17,519
perfectly valid email address

421
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,619
or they won't bounce when they send
email

422
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,849
to show that it's d truly an email of

423
00:25:23,849 --> 00:25:27,239
have a little lotto reply run their
dicks can I send something back saying

424
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:30,409
hi how are you

425
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:34,229
something like that and by the way go
out and find the lodge tomorrow

426
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:38,200
PCM around they're getting prank ideas
from him

427
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,359
trojans and viruses okay these are the
main tools

428
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,809
spammers and hackers used to send spam
to you

429
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:49,079
like I said earlier there virtually
impossible to trace

430
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:52,519
I be used for tacking IRC box

431
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,710
not not protocols of course and

432
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,729
we've got good success in stopping them
real time

433
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:03,759
but only effective in a large ISP level
his hind case I do it

434
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:07,849
take a apt take ass a honeypot

435
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:12,539
and it's on an isolated network I have
some friends up in 20 heart

436
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,408
which is in the motherload which given
me a beautiful fantastica

437
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,679
it. black I can useful whatever I want
to use it for

438
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,799
so what I have he's got a Windows
machine running VMWare

439
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:27,119
run several operating systems on it at
the same time

440
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,029
and 1 a.m. is Windows XP and other one
is Windows 2k

441
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:36,169
and I have another box which is an
OpenBSD box running all kinds sniffers

442
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:37,469
port scanners in

443
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:41,569
hacker tools and everything on it and
it's designed primarily to analyze the

444
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,799
network it's got protocol analyzers and
step on it as well

445
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,989
so what we do is we we we we take a
Windows machine

446
00:26:48,989 --> 00:26:52,349
we establish what is called the baseline
baseline

447
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:56,849
is an analysis and machine before
anything happens it ever attached to it

448
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:00,450
it's just an indication of all that the
dredged although the registries in Iran

449
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,719
on it currently it's a clean machine
it's just been

450
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:07,210
just been created from a the VMware
regional

451
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:12,499
install a Windows machine and then we
monitor the traffic on that without the

452
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:15,749
without the the a the a the actual virus
running

453
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:19,159
and we get an idea what kind network
traffic generated generate a little bit

454
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,589
network traffic but not very much

455
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:25,719
after we've determined at baseline we
then take one at the infected

456
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:29,639
PCs I take 1 I'm I viruses a whole bunch
of them

457
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:33,509
and i infected machine at the virus
around the sniffer

458
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:37,669
and I see what happens in a lock
everything I take every data traffic and

459
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,440
is completely locket

460
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,759
its NP cap format like most sniffers are
and then have another program it goes

461
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,049
through and wisest

462
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:48,379
to speak at staff and analyzes

463
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:52,549
determines what but protocol is extracts
the protocol

464
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:56,700
and then after that it can it then
generates a snort rule for it

465
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,299
and then I test the star of art by
taking that that peak at data feeding it

466
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:01,719
back into the store

467
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:06,529
and verify they can detect it and can
even detect the NOC NOC protocol

468
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:10,169
because all we need to do is is detected
who cares whether it's in crib that we

469
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:11,049
don't care about that

470
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:14,109
all I care about is can I detect yes you
know is it fair

471
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,119
is it not there that's all i care about.
its there

472
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,940
the IDS sent a command for firewall to
block the poor in real time

473
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,710
stopping the virus right in its tracks
the crunch box is a good for that by the

474
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,599
way

475
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,678
so complete spam fighting toolkit
includes a UNIX box

476
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,679
wind blows box which is our sacrificial
lamb and the ability to recapture data

477
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,519
and writes no rules for them

478
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,149
and I with this you can go out there and
analyze viruses in

479
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:44,149
are kinda neat things and the production
network this this is a network that

480
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:45,849
you're going to be using for your

481
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,658
web server your services whatever you
can use your company's

482
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:55,229
network you need an IDS nor you need to
start output couple to a firewall

483
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:58,829
again the crunch box does all that for
you but it's not very hard to write a

484
00:28:58,829 --> 00:28:59,690
script at

485
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,700
it'll take a snort output and control
the firewall got to be carefully

486
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,809
you want to do this on certain ports you
don't want it

487
00:29:06,809 --> 00:29:11,099
you don't wanna just be switching off
switch off your turn on your farwell

488
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,259
fittings in Ogden are necessary of
course

489
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,319
and then and then at that point it just
simply drops packets going to and from

490
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,719
the infected host using part numbers
used by the virus

491
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:25,289
texan not doctor cause well in a machine
owners not even aware this is happening

492
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:28,579
an to beauty of it is the order the
machine

493
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:32,450
it doesn't violate their privacy at all
it doesn't interfere with our service

494
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,200
it and cut off their service it just
disables a virus in real time

495
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,389
which is really important and that stops
the worm in its tracks

496
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:42,529
we've had very good success with this
technique

497
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:47,249
one more last thing I want to talk about
is avoid being spammed

498
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:52,220
I the thing you want to really have we
would have to email address

499
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,039
one your private email address use your
close friends associates your business

500
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,809
people the people you work with

501
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,139
in your cunt in your in your work or
whatever you're doing and that have

502
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:03,759
another email address

503
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,089
and it's not uncommon you just have like
Hotmail email address is something like

504
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:07,899
that this is

505
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:11,539
throwaway email address and you would
use this first doing things like posting

506
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:12,679
Usenet

507
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,789
going up on mailing lists filling out
web forms

508
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,408
pages website Contax and stuff like that

509
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:22,299
so use your private email of course for
close friends and never give out your

510
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:24,168
email to those your trust

511
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:28,129
another important thing okay to finish
up with my contact information this is

512
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:29,950
how you can contact me

513
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,389
and if I running a little early on this
site I can probably see if I get to

514
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:34,759
smell thing working

515
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:38,049
and the show you some real clad real
real cool things

516
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,149
I just neat and tidy sometimes it's good
to see me started

517
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:44,489
and in the meantime i cant I can answer
any questions at this point so if you

518
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:46,970
have any questions this is a good time
to answer them

519
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:53,970
for ask them

520
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,800
well I'm just using that as an example
you could read it in whatever language

521
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,800
you want doesn't matter

522
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,269
well I'm sure some people do that you
know but a lot of people that would

523
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:24,269
and he says people don't reckon we have
fun with

524
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:31,820
but said

525
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:38,820
we think yeah go ahead you in the middle
there

526
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,050
exactly and I don't I don't reply I to
report to the authorities

527
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,200
a reporting spam the thirties

528
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,560
wasted time mean for one thing okay I am

529
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,610
even on my server been attacked I had I
kid I kid

530
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,340
I could easily substantiate more than
five or six thousand dollars in losses

531
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,060
I have tried to report to the
authorities but guess what

532
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,560
there's not equal justice equal justice
for all anymore in this country unless

533
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,120
your Microsoft a tie with Microsoft
problem

534
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,820
I could probably get the attention to
the FBI but I have tried many times to

535
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,030
file reports and I have not been able to
do it yeah

536
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:19,030
absolutely in this is one of the reasons
why I am NOT

537
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:23,830
sports absolutely

538
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,960
and absolutely

539
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,880
and I have I have very very for more
stocks on that let me tell you how I'm

540
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,010
going to be dealing with that

541
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:36,820
a what number one is I'm not going to be
releasing this to the public number one

542
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,210
I only because it does have a lot of
potential for abuse

543
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,620
if your girlfriend's e-mail is in that
spam pot ready to send out spam

544
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,680
you can best bet your tweet defeat her
email address or the e-mail address will

545
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,530
be hosed by the Internet Service
Provider

546
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,050
I have on in early testing have
overlooked

547
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,830
some email messages should not have been
in there yes indeedy I have had people's

548
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,460
internet service is interrupted

549
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,860
and it has caused some problems yes sir
that is a problem

550
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,140
however I have way around to make it as
easy as possible for somebody to do that

551
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,230
if and when I get around to putting a
web-based interface on this and making

552
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,300
it available to my

553
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,770
web crunchers users I'm going to have a
system set up so that when i'd

554
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,350
when I DUI man have what is called the
viewings system

555
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,900
they can give you 50 messages at a time
when screen full

556
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,170
and it and you can use very quickly
glanced down through

557
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:35,440
page 50 at a time 50th time it's pretty
easy to visually spot HTML code because

558
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,240
of this that these HTML

559
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,040
so it's not too not too hard for me to
just click on the check box in the ones

560
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,990
I don't wanna send

561
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,580
and only when I page to every single
page %uh spam pop them in the San

562
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,390
will will it let the reporter actually
do the reporting so yeah

563
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,880
there's a definite a means that the
issue

564
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,560
things when use a turn off your DSL

565
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,950
I have DSL do you think you just turn
off the DSL modem

566
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,790
I me I turn off my computer but just me
turned up the DSL modem

567
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,110
saying absolutely if you're not using a
DSL modem why leave Iraq

568
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,200
you know a lot of people just don't
bother because they think they know that

569
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,970
taken the on forever and not have to pay
any extra

570
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,290
they don't bother turning machine of
these leave it on or

571
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,560
if you have like a Netgear router and
you kept your DSL

572
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,469
I you know unless you turn your router
of you know

573
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:29,290
normally use leave it on all the time
having subnet inside the house more than

574
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,489
one person can use it

575
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:37,110
I mean that's that's pretty common
skipping it is mail starting in some

576
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,140
reason as my mail

577
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:42,109
my pal program is there even functioning
correctly in

578
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:47,200
weird on the popular use

579
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,770
up services like span a spam gourmet and
mail in eight er

580
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:57,020
and also on mail filters as are your
spam filters as a defense against spam

581
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,980
yeah yeah yet we work with spam filters
and we have a Bayesian filter

582
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,520
plus 1i partners working on a really
really good filter

583
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,910
but the only problem is good filter is
extremely slow

584
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,140
I mean it's infinitely slow so its

585
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,240
its I'm not really sure are how

586
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,860
acker to do this but I can tell you this
that after filtering

587
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,520
250,000 message is not one message was
ham

588
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,030
and ham is and my definition of
something that's not spam

589
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,300
so it's it's a very very good actually

590
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,530
yeah I have a question about the
opposite of what you've been talking

591
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,100
about

592
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,720
I get barrages I'll bounce messages

593
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,700
from spam that's being sent out using
some of my domain

594
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,160
right there they're they're using your
their hijacking your email address

595
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,859
but they're doing I don't know what to
do that yeah that Scott that's often

596
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,340
referred to as it showed job

597
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,800
and this happened this this this happens
a lot

598
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,420
and it's not really much you can do
about it except identify where the mail

599
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,240
comes from and get inch up a host of
that sent you that bounce

600
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:10,240
has probably the best thing you can do
at this point

601
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,760
I've been having a lot of problems with
comment spam on my website and I'm

602
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,820
wondering if you can talk about the
mechanisms behind

603
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,430
that and then on they generally this
only and I S your IP address which

604
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,950
goes along with wondering if those are
generally use owners they tend to be

605
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,490
the first couple that is exactly the
same what comments panelists am on my

606
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,730
blog like they'll come

607
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,840
a personal web sites like you have a
great site my name is phentermine please

608
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,410
visit my site you know so

609
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,839
yeah I get a lot of that too and was
wondering if you know like how are they

610
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,070
how are you finding my side

611
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,240
is there any way to sort block what's at

612
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,770
I'm not exactly sure I'll where you can
do about that

613
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,640
what's at whether some ways around it i
mean you know you can

614
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,710
if he if he's coming in from in if it's
coming in from a single source

615
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,180
a single IP block you can you simply you
know

616
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,220
block II email coming from that IP block

617
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,940
you just block it by IP address yeah

618
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,010
arm two months ago I came across from
those web sites generate

619
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,960
fake email addresses and every time you
refresh they look legitimate could you

620
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,630
comment if you think those are affected
a

621
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,730
email addresses just you know was like a
random generator

622
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,460
at Sonso dot com dot net the Arctic take
up their uses

623
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,870
I would use that for instance if I if I
were to like fill out a form stage

624
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,350
and if I was interested in something but
I really didn't want these guys to spam

625
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,180
me

626
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,290
I would also use it if I wear let's say
one to post something the Usenet

627
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,710
I would do something like that if I can
read in if I can read mail from that

628
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,240
that would be what you would use these
things or it's the same thing is getting

629
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,540
yourself a hotmail

630
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,800
hotmail account

631
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,940
anybody else yeah

632
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,860
you yeah do you believe that

633
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,880
a perhaps a new protocol could be
developed

634
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,380
for sending mail that would prevent spam

635
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,690
well that would be really nice

636
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:18,370
now you are nice but let's try to keep
Microsoft Outlook show if

637
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:23,620
yes seem to be worthwhile reporting of
the spammed with that include even

638
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,850
flooring it EU CE FTC .co

639
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,890
what does that help them compile
statistics to see

640
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,240
then what exactly what it does the
latter it helps them pipe compile

641
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,410
statistics

642
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,790
in fact I gave a talk at an expo
security conference back in now

643
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,990
back last last last month that toward
the end over in the last month

644
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,760
and I was on a panel with the FTC and
that this person Jonathan

645
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,080
and got all the inside scoop on now

646
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,130
on what you know what how they do that
%uh

647
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,810
the best sir my recollection are getting
350,000 spam submissions

648
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,000
a day what they do is they have a

649
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,200
automatic system that to the Kb latest
information

650
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,750
and categorizes it in various different
forms in ways

651
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,810
and collects all that information at in
statistically analyze it

652
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,910
and what they do is they act they pick
just one or two is a really good like

653
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,089
the ones that are easy

654
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,290
for them to track down they're not going
to go after the ones that are hard to

655
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:26,970
track down

656
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:30,960
not gonna go after the ones that that
are sending it sending their span to

657
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,890
infected host

658
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,250
they are gonna go through once it is
sending spam through perhaps

659
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,040
proxies taken somehow get contact
information for

660
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,990
or if it's a standardized website they
can probably get

661
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:48,040
information from the domain name nets
possible to

662
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,150
the deal with that well again they're
coming from infected host so I'm don't

663
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:52,550
bother

664
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:55,760
trace them what they're trying to do

665
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,420
is they don't care whether or not their
advertising anything what they're trying

666
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,110
to do is they're trying to throw off the
spam filters

667
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,300
see what does this send out a bunch of
gibberish

668
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,540
knowing that it's not really going to do
any good

669
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,550
except for one thing it throws off the
filters so it's gonna open up

670
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:18,730
the filters to let more span through
when they send subsequent spans down

671
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,890
through their sort through their system
so it just kinda opens up there

672
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:26,910
system a little bit better I have it

673
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,950
yeah the report internet fraud division
of

674
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,290
your I once got reverse primer doing and
Scott

675
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,710
well that's all fine that's thats a fine
if you can do that

676
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:43,000
you know thats that's really cool

677
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,010
report yes I did I have I got quite a
few submissions already

678
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:53,760
already the it pending and they've just
been ignoring me

679
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,410
remember that I am John T Draper I'm not
very rich

680
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:03,040
I'm running a very small web crunchers
web hosting an email service

681
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,250
and I'm barely making a couple hundred
bucks a month of it if that

682
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:12,070
however if I Microsoft making millions
and millions dollars

683
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,480
an and I'm and I complain to the FBI

684
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,340
the FBI's can listen to me because I'm a
big corporation

685
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,740
like I said there's not much equal
justice for all anymore in this country

686
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,000
a

687
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,840
how you can just get rid of can you do
nobody could just get rid

688
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,520
all the spam in the whole internet
system I mean

689
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,150
the internet system so big it's just how
how you just can't really get rid of

690
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,540
the best thing you can do is used
technical means

691
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,220
to make it is expensive and it's hard as
possible for spammers

692
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,400
span in hopes to have discouraging them
and I seem to be doing a reasonably good

693
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,920
job that actually

694
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,470
according to the reports have been
getting from MySpace on my spam spies

695
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,660
question about following the money trail
obviously you can't really do anything

696
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,160
with the authorities to these companies
since their completely outside of their

697
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,950
jurisdiction

698
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,050
are this country in the Middle East in
Eastern Europe

699
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:09,630
we can really touch 'em is there
anything being done to boycott the

700
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,110
companies that

701
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,910
patronize them I mean you have companies
that use these marketing services that

702
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,040
end up spending

703
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,910
is there any kind a boycott list have
all these girls were people could find

704
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,540
out if somebody was

705
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,900
either knowingly or unknowingly
patronizing a spammer such a good boy

706
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,120
doing business with

707
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,380
not to my recollection however that
would be a good

708
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,730
that would be a good little project
somebody could take on

709
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,960
is to do that you know you'd have to
have a credit card have a little bit a

710
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,930
disposable cash in hand try to buy these
things

711
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,990
but eat but by East think casa serve
another vid

712
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,160
sir look at sure a bat purpose in a
conservative purpose

713
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,660
the bat purposes you're buying from a
spammer

714
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:54,080
and that encourages spammy we we wanna
try to discourage people from buying

715
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,069
from spammers

716
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,700
altogether because send mine spammers
realize it K

717
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,520
they're not making any more money
they're not selling anything cuz

718
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,710
nobody's buying anything maybe they'll
stop

719
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,970
well that's not going to be likely the
other on but on the other hand

720
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,290
if you have if you have disposable cash
on hand and

721
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:14,630
really wanna go after these people
that's the best way to do it

722
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:18,130
because number one you're going to get a
statement from your financial

723
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,250
institution

724
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:24,390
your credit card company on just exactly
who process that credit card

725
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,490
you can contact your bank and that
information is public

726
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:31,220
once you've contacted the bank then you
can contact that bank and say hey this

727
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,850
is a fraudulent transaction

728
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,040
and I know because I've had anemic
e-commerce account

729
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,450
we shop I P back in just before the dot
bomb days

730
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,490
took me out and what happened was

731
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,640
there very very sensitive about what
they call chargebacks

732
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,330
you know they'll hit you really hard
with these up the wise do it the charge

733
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,470
something back

734
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:57,090
a chargeback means you have to return
and item that they're not satisfied with

735
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:00,420
and if you let that bank know in no
uncertain terms that hey

736
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,580
these people are fraudulent yeah they're
gonna do something about it and to me

737
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,840
that's the best approach that i cant

738
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,790
I can suggest people to take but it can
it take somebody with disposable cash to

739
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:11,250
do that

740
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:17,550
I'm not one of those persons pic yes

741
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:24,540
yeah yet

742
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:30,140
exactly right

743
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,310
well what I do what I do is I

744
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:37,230
what I do is I this'll I take a message

745
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,290
and I evaluate each other words in the
message

746
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:44,730
how many of these words are in the error
in the dictionary and our English

747
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,860
language words

748
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,560
the less number words that's in English
Dictionary

749
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,190
is indeed it to the dictionary the more
likely it's going to be a spam

750
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:00,230
and my threshold is very very low so if
there's just one or two words in there

751
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,160
that are not in the English Dictionary
its gets considered spam

752
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,370
and so it automatically gets classified
and go to any other filters

753
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:10,740
I've got three filter system the first
filter

754
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:14,350
what it does is it takes a new UN codes

755
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:17,670
takes a you you decode the message in
the English

756
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,660
okay the next thing it does it strips
out the HTML tags are often used to

757
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,460
confuse the filters

758
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,930
you know it put in these be ours not
least HTML

759
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,060
angle bracket tags: in the middle of the
word

760
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,240
so if it says VI and then there's an
angle bracket

761
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,270
SP angle bracket a and other angle
bracket

762
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,630
you know and these peace with the the
things are embedded in a message but I

763
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,530
do is I take all that out

764
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:46,160
in a turn into a more than English E
type a word then I feed

765
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,259
back to the Beijing filters and getting
about 96 to 98 percent

766
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,720
filtering really good and in scammers
can't get past that anymore because I

767
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,420
just felt it out before

768
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,620
I do that this is called pre filtering
in a highly recommend that you do that

769
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,859
and all it takes is just regular routine
because in their looks

770
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:08,900
analyzes body the message looks for
things like HTML tags in HTML tag

771
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,410
is probably going to be span and I have
to do is tell my friends never send

772
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:12,859
email

773
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,140
in HTML and you're gonna be just fine

774
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,560
so let me find now an email address here

775
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,880

776

777
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,440

782
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,810
a looking for a message with the

783
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,390
with that with that hash code that guy

784
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,770
unfortunately max I'm now is so slow and

785

787
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,610
and i ended

788
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,510
yeah go ahead as one what's server using
on BSD known

789
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:17,620
you try anything like spam assess I
tried in actually am using the

790
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,069
the spam days Beijing filtering in
writing my own code

791
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,120
and the servers I use is most often
OpenBSD

792
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:30,880
I thats my servers choice because it's
scary what

793
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,690
yeah I use sendmail a must see as the
sender I don't wanna bother too much

794
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,190
with

795
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:38,580
with actual email coming in but when I
get my new system

796
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,680
built and I'm gonna be implementing my
own MTA

797
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,120
and I've already got parts is
implemented I'm actually gonna be

798
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,540
developing that in twisted Python

799
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:50,940
I might buy language choices Python and
and twisted pipelines got

800
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,250
very very wonderful way of handling this
thing's and have absolute total control

801
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,500
over how milken's in using twisted
pipeline

802
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,730
and it's very fast in it's also designed
for

803
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,770
multiple males coming in at the same
time totally a synchronised

804
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:08,370
and all that I think I'm about at a time
folks I want to thank you very much for

805
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:08,890
attending
