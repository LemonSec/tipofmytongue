1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,219
challenge that turns

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,010
anybody code into print Lasky loader
that's

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,510
will to the club owners up there by Kurd

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,400
so I'll

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,539
that's what I said a working yourself or
you can use it for voting ideas

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:27,460
are forced incurred in the bars service
for the way it works

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:34,460
is place and ASCII testing

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,880
okay so

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:56,180
mississippi's shocker right in

10
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,040
makes it into something like that songs

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,970
so

12
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,789
exit as adjusting for instructions pushy
expire PSP

13
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,920
and subtract and instructions for

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,930
yeltsin yeps years of me without

15
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,479
memory works in the stack just different
segments and

16
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,710
media just return

17
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,840
us cause and

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,030
records registers like

19
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,229
the stack is structure the cube steak
Rams

20
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,990
and see you get the heap and stack in
the stack grows

21
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,759
this way well he throws this way the
texting

22
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,119
which is up higher when you do like a
stackoverflow

23
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,229
your tricking execution planner into
going

24
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:56,640
in the stack memory where you have a
shocker so you get

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,700
the IP the execution and ESP

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,740
both in the stack so yes

27
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,200
yeah push here X alright

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,610
whatever value your ex's into the stack
by pushing

29
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,620
those four bytes honest each time you
push

30
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,049
builds towards lower addresses because
the stack

31
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:22,900
builds backwards and then

32
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,840
pop as people take whatever values at
ESP actually

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,370
right back into ESP register

34
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,860
so like this for instructions

35
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,630
and you assemble them and then he looked
then

36
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,160
just in a text editor I see that pussy
axis capital P

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,010
which seizes remember obvious P is
backslash

38
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,298
and track TX is the minus sign

39
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:53,720
followed by the for by word which is
attracting from yet

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,040
and and yet Arthur

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,640
author if you look at the very bottom

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,370
a she assembled pushy expire PSP so the
ex from

43
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,290
4141 for the monitors capital A and you
do it for those for instructions when

44
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,048
you assemble it

45
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,730
the assembled machine code a actually

46
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,850
is in a printable range

47
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,620
cells as for instructions around getting

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,359
questions alright

49
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,400
a I guess so there's a for instructions
written out

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,739
and as long as you use printable values
for

51
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,470
the the words that year home subtracting
you're adding from your ex

52
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,470
I you can use our printable

53
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,940
ASCII instructions so the way the loader
actually works

54
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,430
is so since the stack moves

55
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,620
this way and the AP is this way

56
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,810
i'd if you use biscuit with the loader
does

57
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,269
is its gonna build the bytecode onto the
stack

58
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,500
by pushing it so it's basically reading

59
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,380
is gonna write the the bytecode on the
stack backwards

60
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,798
%uh from ESP moving back

61
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,570
so you wanna do is you wanna first set
the stack pointer

62
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,080
com somewhere after your loader code

63
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,150
and then as yet he goes through their

64
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,669
so the way say is PE is

65
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,909
a first yet year x2 whatever value what
use p2p

66
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,730
and then pushy accident obvious P you
can do that

67
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,790
all with us for instructions other ways
EX two arbitrary values

68
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,010
is he just keeps attracting printable
values from it until it wraps around to

69
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,060
enter a value on a

70
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,500
you can usually do it in you can't get
into any value in

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,430
123 the subtractions threes the maximum
the autograph to do

72
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,010
so then he said he X 20 he is Peter v
say is P

73
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,659
and then after you do that

74
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,290
you said EA next to you the last four
bytes have your bike code

75
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,820
you push that the stack these attract
more values from EX to wrap it around

76
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,950
again to

77
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,360
the second to last four bytes have your
by child and push that the stack again

78
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,450
in just keep doing that and as

79
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,099
the AP reads through the lower QA this
way its building

80
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,900
the bytecode a backwards towards the IP

81
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,600
and if you said a ESP to be

82
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,330
right at that and the view larger could
a plus

83
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,190
the number reply to the biker that
you're building arm

84
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,800
Dhabi at the and if you look at the last
push instruction

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,160
European years P will meet at the same
address and

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,270
yep you're just flown to the newly built
by Kurd

87
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,570
their cup thanks gotta watch out for
like if its normal four fours and slowly

88
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,270
push for my words you gotta

89
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,750
pet was no ups and stuff but to

90
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,740
yeah it's basically a technique

91
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,330
oh and then to start out you have 20
year exxon house

92
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,590
so the way 0 it is by

93
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,240
ending two conflicting bit values and

94
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,470
do that you can insure that like if you
and

95
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:28,260
a any value with a and 8

96
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,770
you always good 0 because like the dates
they

97
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,099
she and yeah years the hand tradition on

98
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,030
yeah ok in an awesome if you can be
exact with putting ESP where you wanna

99
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,920
you can just sort of guesstimate and
threw it somewhere and then

100
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,090
a after you've built your by a code you
just

101
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,920
rap EX around to be Iraq's 1990 1990

102
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,380
and then with every one bite love push
instruction

103
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,180
you build four bytes %uh no ups lead so
I can build back to itself really

104
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,280
quickly

105
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,370
and then you just make a second no ups
lead to bridge

106
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,380
from the and the load occurred to the

107
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:20,380
home newly built by Kurd

108
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,700
that's a plus

109
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,830
searchers a really simple program right
that's cool

110
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:19,830
so

111
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:29,090
thanks

112
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,550
us victors dads

113
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,189
huge

114
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:09,190
good counsel yes but think

115
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,840
resolution yes

116
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,670
in years

117
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,020
okay it well it's a through cell %uh

118
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,800
this is the standard explain right just
show the shock good

119
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,920
into environment variable and alright
return address with

120
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,920
whatever the crap that is right on

121
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,990
10 are here on

122
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,170
I up fliers income vs on

123
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,400
so that's really simple

124
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,840
right then this one's a little bit
harder because it does

125
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,470
filtering arguments should market

126
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,720
is print it will only allow printable
characters for the second argument

127
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,720
so

128
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,040
so okay I'll try to put suckered into
the second argument but you couldn't

129
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,030
because

130
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,760
well won't allow it and this one clears
out all the environment variable see

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,319
can't put shaiken environment anymore

132
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,550
so somehow you gotta get shellcode into
you

133
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,140
that buffer that only allows print what
characters so

134
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:44,140
that will fit in there

135
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,560
on

136
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,130
okay so the couple dash and switch will

137
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,529
optimize which will just set the SP do
/b exactly at the right point so doesn't

138
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,130
have to build the crazy no upper age

139
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,580
on and

140
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,839
the right to let up stuff at the
standard air and only writes the

141
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,080
the shellcode to stand out so you can
just

142
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:22,080
on use it in like this

143
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:30,990
so so the reason that crashed right
there is because

144
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,500
it didn't know where to set pSP iso two
sons the very end at the stack

145
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,670
so in this case the the No ops let it
wasn't big enough to you

146
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,280
get to the newly built by Kurd so it
just falls off then to the loader in

147
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:52,280
crashes

148
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:17,019
I'll try

149
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,980
area

150
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,070
arm so yet

151
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,639
that time you give it the right target
address

152
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,050
and it money is not dead right and

153
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,399
years any questions if I was there do I
need to explain that

154
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,899
arm it just built a biker dance

155
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,320
a there's actually a point where your
penis be met

156
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,820
and clutter and bacon

157
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,660
and then as even more restrictive on

158
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:54,660
that sons

159
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:09,869
Academy seid to split

160
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,710
okay so this one a only allows a very
very restrictive character set

161
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,730
but that's okay because

162
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,930
you can

163
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:35,930
define the character set as long as you
skip everything properly

164
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,649
assists

165
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:49,880
okay so this issue is too small a
character set only

166
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,110
12 characters and when it finishes it
gets to

167
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,140
185 bytes have this one works on those
weird conditions

168
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:07,140
just because Maria has been weird place
here

169
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,610
apps

170
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,470
to sometimes him soon as it'll move
because the

171
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,390
the I could changed in length before
those two in 64 bytes long

172
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,319
the standstill in 59 that just because

173
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,990
it's trying to find sets values the
dickens

174
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,920
track to wrap around and sometimes you
know you have to use three instead of

175
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,339
two

176
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,640
depending on what the bakers and where
in his memory

177
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,120
again offices on the ones

178
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,899
canceling switched to area

179
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:25,149
so if you look at what that actual

180
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:32,149
make looks like

181
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,220
so

182
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,930
there there it is using only capital A
percent p

183
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:53,930
and you know others restrictive
characters again

184
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,260
lasting is I'm getting challenge good

185
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,569
on fire on his website and one other
challengers as this one

186
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,530
basically it clears out all the memory

187
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,380
so you gotten know where to put your
shock about it all.

188
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:18,380
sort of pain yes

189
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:31,310
apps

190
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:04,070
so

191
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,440
the stack

192
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,440
just

193
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:24,139
out is on the environment staff and
users are zeroed so

194
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:31,139
you see a whole lotta nothing

195
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:40,340
so for

196
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:59,950
a good

197
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:06,950
so

198
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:09,529
so

199
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:15,330
look at very and Marie

200
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,049
has very and there's the name of the
program that's running

201
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,509
so that's the one

202
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:29,509
thing that you can control really so
control

203
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,090
so snugs shocker to salute smaller

204
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:44,070
so

205
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,350
we're gonna do is Rena make a symlink
using this

206
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,420
to you the program and then

207
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,130
we're going to make make it we're gonna
expletive

208
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,730
by making execution plan to return back
into the name in the programs running

209
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,400
which will build the bytecode another in
the stack

210
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,940
exit from here as we have to make sure
we save enough space at the end the

211
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,510
stack

212
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:11,470
otherwise for any building right into
another kid so

213
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,930
40 bytes

214
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,440
should be good has to learn

215
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,310
and building from be a

216
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,320
other essay so track

217
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:34,320
to 1

218
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,640
this

219
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,640
first

220
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,670
this

221
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,790
so

222
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,158
so get this crazy thing

223
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,179
to run the crazy thing Islands

224
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,169
31 so

225
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:23,990
we just returned into you where's

226
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,900
star and

227
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,690
to

228
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,530
on

229
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:38,389
and as 17 questions

230
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:45,389
option anything shit

231
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:07,010
I'll it's just really sample on CBS code

232
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,280
basically yes it's really simple

233
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,470
on alls doing as its breeding through
the bytecode

234
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,660
and sick person sees if it's in chunks a
foreign if not a paired with no ops

235
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,590
and then it I use

236
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,120
because I see this function stir fry a
string Friday just

237
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,450
makes n-grams outta are anagrams and
strings

238
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,860
so use that to randomize the character
sir

239
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:43,860
so like at every time you every time you
do it it's a little bit different

240
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,850
because it just picking random
characters of it into

241
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,880
whatever have

242
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,580
on desert

243
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,409
is pretty simple code any

244
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,570
other questions like

245
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,159
if you do not a remote system Licensed
it's probably

246
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,880
really only useful for local explained
to him thinkers like unless you know

247
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,020
where some things in me happening in
memory or like

248
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:18,300
if you can build a big enough no ups
Latino the year about

249
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,530
where's was to be user only manner

250
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,700
nr7

251
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:32,700
questions

252
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,389
I don't know arm its

253
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:41,880
maybe as possible Ivan I liked and
instructions

254
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,880
there this is just rip well

255
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:57,150
this doesn't leasing for instructions

256
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,799
yeah

257
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,730
it is just a question of you know the
subset love

258
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,280
instructions are also printable you're
limited to those new can figure out a

259
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,470
way to do it using theirs and grape

260
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,289
and I down

261
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,240
and Creek I'll

262
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,620
higher no doubts questions

263
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,610
attack in alaska happen

264
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,610
book too and also to hand out some
things if he has one

265
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,710
but it and an answer your questions

266
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:40,710
shoot at us in a pretty things out

267
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,760
and access systems exactly the same way
I mean as is just

268
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,720
this is architecture level so on yes

269
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,070
it would work the same way just have to
change the memory addresses

270
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,460
on doesn't use any

271
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,840
sis calls or anything cell

272
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,090
I mean should be able to like an exe
systems will be able to build

273
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:16,480
by Kurd using this just the same way
just have to make sure you use

274
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,480
placard as he's a Lexus cars

275
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,740
so I get a new one have anything else

276
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,710
shit

277
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,190
yeah it's this possum filed a calm pH

278
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,409
hi RL on and

279
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:46,019
yet you want in you can put the stuff
architectural easily

280
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:49,639
120 I did accept stir fry isn't in

281
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:54,960
like the VSD stuff so just makin little
function that randomize is a string

282
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,960
its realism I just like to do that I was
a funny

283
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,350
say and went to those things here's one
on the list little

284
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:16,350
handouts and yes shameless promotion

285
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,010
yes that's it us
