conference on the five-year the showed

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:17,780
okay I'm and was gonna go and get
started

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,420
I'm with Annalee at the FF who I
encourage I love you

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,289
to please join I'm there's some pretty
tough fights out there and if everybody

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,150
kicks in 10 bucks 20 bucks

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,560
are these guys will have the resources
to keep the man

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,410
out your house am we also have doc

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,410
said doc taken away

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,440
pretty quick

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,050
as much details at like you know you
when you're more interesting people

13
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,739
the thing about the Patriot Act as we
heard a lot of hype we've heard a lot of

14
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:00,760
good analysis we know

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,129
really know what it means so what I'm
trying to do is drive together in the

16
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,810
context of all the previous law that its
modified

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,440
and that takes about an hour and I've
got about 15 minutes I'm gonna get

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:10,990
started

19
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,390
when you consider the seizure

20
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,280
electronic evidence and by the way if
yet and how they take it if you wanna

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,920
protected

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,530
we're dealing with four primary laws
here

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,080
there are other laws yes but these are
the big ones title3

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,770
the wiretap order the pen trace statute
the

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,259
ECPA and finally the USA PATRIOT Act
we've heard so much about recently

26
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,350
am

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,910
the thing to consider about each of the
instruments defined by these laws

28
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,899
is it the established a different set of
legal standards before

29
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,160
a search instrument can be issued no use
the term instrument very specifically

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,550
because they're not all warrants

31
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,060
the title three order now this is from
the highest burden to law enforcement to

32
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,740
the lowest

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,369
the title three order has the highest
burden there's a lot of administrative

34
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,130
oversight not get to that in just a
second

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,658
but you have to meet the full search
warrant standard

36
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,489
a probable cause with the title 31 plus

37
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,290
their minimisation procedures and
reporting procedures that have to go

38
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,380
into in their monitored

39
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,890
second is a Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 41b search warrant this is the

40
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,510
federal version of a search warrant it
meets the protections

41
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,679
that we've come to expect in our search
and seizure law its

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,269
in that is the simple probable cause
standard

43
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,880
get to more about that the second here a
the next

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,260
burdensome you know going down the list
on burden to law enforcement he had the

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,220
ECPA 2703 order

46
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,970
this requires a law enforcement state
specific and articulable facts

47
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,079
showing reasonable grounds to believe
that the records a relevant and material

48
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,980
to an ongoing criminal investigation

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,459
that's not a high standard to me right
however

50
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,200
full information that can be derived
from that order is less man a search for

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,709
less than a title 31

52
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,500
so make it down one more we have the pen
register

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,250
or trap and trace device order and the
requirement the law enforcement has to

54
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,890
meet with this one is that it's relevant

55
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,319
it's relevant to a criminal
investigation

56
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,390
that is an extremely easy standard to me

57
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:18,819
the next instrument as a subpoena with
notice this is notice given

58
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,090
to the person whose records were
subpoenaed from a third party in

59
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,300
the requirement the law enforcement has
to me with that is delivering a piece a

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,330
paper to the court

61
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,360
that's it or the electronic content by
fax or whatever the mechanism the court

62
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,849
allows

63
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:37,379
finally the least burden to law
enforcement would be a subpoena with the

64
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:38,220
late notice

65
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,170
in this case law enforcement can obtain
records

66
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,750
from let's say an ISP and not have that
ISP notify the owner those records for

67
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,170
up to 90 days within

68
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,370
easy extension which basically involves
taking we have an extension

69
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,700
in this the pyre

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,519
this requires upon written certification
in a supervisory official

71
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,489
read any sergeant any corporal in a
local PD

72
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,140
on up the food chain that there is
reason to believe that notification

73
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,360
the existence and subpoena may have it
in adverse result

74
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,500
an an adverse result is left up to 14
Smith to decide

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,488
with an understanding implants

76
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,960
I'd like to mention a little bit more
about the burden

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,109
title3 on law enforcement and that is
all applications for the

78
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,090
title3 wiretap orders are submitted to
the US Attorney's Office

79
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,300
generally title3 requires that all
domestic wiretap applications be

80
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,930
reported to the Administrative Office

81
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,550
United States Courts you can get these
reports back to I believe

82
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,159
am you know I don't remember enough bad
a

83
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:51,169
sixty hang on a second I get another
overhead

84
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:54,659
you can get these reports are available
on the web

85
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:58,099
you can go see how many reports have an
issue that's part of this reporting

86
00:04:58,099 --> 00:04:59,890
requirement

87
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,940
and and also to mention under the
clinton administration department

88
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,589
justice was directed to reduce the
number of applications

89
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:09,460
increase the productivity orders granted
what that means is there was a push

90
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,049
injustice to get the number down in the
number that produced

91
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,039
prosecutions up right so you don't just
have a title three order sitting out

92
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:18,969
there

93
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,250
having people's lines monitored with
nothing coming up was a little bit of

94
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,039
accountability that this kind of
reporting

95
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:30,719
added to it potentially that there were
some teeth to it

96
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:34,039
this is from those reports you can see
the number love

97
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,210
request from federal law enforcement
actually starting to taper off their at

98
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,560
the very end

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,460
once a clinton administration issued
that order

100
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,649
in here are summarized it numbers

101
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:51,649
there were fewer wiretap requests almost
1200 on them in the year two thousand

102
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:55,430
they were completed that year that's
down 5 percent

103
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,560
so that reporting prime it does have
some tea it's not just for show

104
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,500
sup perfect but it's there and it has
some effect when we put in place

105
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,550
there was greater precision wiretapping
during that year

106
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,830
for example wiretaps were in effect 15
percent fewer days per order then in

107
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,109
1999

108
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,930
in I think everyone would agree that
there are times when wiretap should

109
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,409
exist

110
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:24,010
if thank everyone but yeah I should know
not everyone

111
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,370
almost every law degree there sometimes
something may be very extreme cases some

112
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,190
the Minot

113
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,820
but the fact of the matter is it
certainly should be reviewed by an

114
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,339
objective third party as required by law

115
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,930
in it certainly should be monitored and
we certainly should be aware of it

116
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,200
at the very least we need to know that
it's going on how much what's going on

117
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,500
incriminating intercepts per wiretap
which means that there was actually a

118
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,240
crime afoot

119
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,440
that was detected with that were to
happen frankly they're gonna issue I'm

120
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,789
I hope they at least catch somebody
committing a crime with them as opposed

121
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:52,849
to just listen in and

122
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:59,800
innocent people's conversations were up
3 percent

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,620
I'm this is another thing to think about
now last year I was working in for

124
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,149
I'm addresses from last time I was
working the information desk in a guy

125
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:08,349
came up said

126
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:13,110
yeah I think I spotted a fed sick really
think it is

127
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,020
Mike yeah okay he actually looks like a
bed you surprised so I rode out

128
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,149
the average federal wiretap cost fifty
five thousand dollars

129
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:24,209
you're not worth it and gave it to him I
was hoping that that knowledge would set

130
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,880
him free

131
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,830
right but that's one agents year's pay

132
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,880
per wiretap these things are just
getting distribute around I'm not

133
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,630
talking about faisal wiretaps year

134
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:40,860
just domestic title three wiretaps these
things are expensive and I need to be

135
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,560
controlled

136
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,190
I don't want my tax dollars going for
these things the average class about

137
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,510
54,000 829 dollars

138
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,710
in the average cost was down 5 percent
because they were in effect fewer days

139
00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:00,710
for the year domestic wiretaps cost the
US taxpayers sixty five million dollars

140
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,360
a by the way

141
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,050
all that information is publicly
available the administrative office the

142
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,520
US courts provides for you

143
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,969
but take a look at its air home

144
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,250
minimisation procedures exist with title
three orders

145
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,940
to keep the you know keep

146
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,030
law enforcement from was in the
conversations are not relevant to a

147
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,169
criminal investigation

148
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,430
I want the techniques eases cold polling
with a listen

149
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,690
for 30 seconds every two minutes until
they hear something that's relevant to

150
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,669
the investigation

151
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,429
now that was recorded

152
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,669
doesn't work either ways yes I I think
we all understand it does

153
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,490
that agents may be listening in but
they're not recording because there is

154
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,390
an audit trail available should people
wanna look into it right so they have to

155
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,439
turn off the recorder

156
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,740
it's not relevant to a criminal
investigation that's part of the

157
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,860
minimisation procedures required by the
order issued to them

158
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,940
to tap that wire and one of the reasons
why tetra so expensive is because it

159
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,570
requires full time monitoring

160
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,089
thats part in the stink about carnival
in legal circles and the arcane legal

161
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,040
reasons carnival was so detestable

162
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,670
was that it was full time monitoring and
there was no mechanism to turn it off

163
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,420
because it was all filtered

164
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,860
by the equivalent the electronic
equivalent other person listening to it

165
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,410
that's a

166
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,329
extremely esoteric point law but it's
relevant because it will change the

167
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,910
president

168
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,689
about law want things to consider about
search-and-seizure law

169
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,000
is the huge distinction between
transmittal information and content now

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,700
the government

171
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,660
first recognized it information like on
a letter

172
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,000
I don t make it up that every hartman on
the stamp little small intimate

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,120
is there information out settlers public
information site reading a post card

174
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,620
the address for your sending it to where
it's coming from Waterbeach is right on

175
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,579
it is really not private you don't have
a reasonable expectation of privacy for

176
00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:58,800
the outside a letter

177
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,880
however you do have a reasonable
expectation of privacy for the content

178
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,589
so that letter

179
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,589
if you are a letter to Grandma nobody
needs to know what you're saying to

180
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:07,030
Grandma

181
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,970
unless they have a warrant in a Detached
third party has agreed

182
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,180
it could lead to legitimate prosecution

183
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,890
in there was probable cause to believe
it will produce evidence of a crime

184
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,810
this distinction continues to this very
day and it's a very important one

185
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,180
that

186
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,500
is what that is the maze the Naveen

187
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,720
copy this down this is amazing navigate
to figure out what particular search

188
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,300
device

189
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,870
need given the typeof information you
want this

190
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,310
started out as a stack the law books
this tall the US

191
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,280
attorney torrent year reduced it to
report about an inch thick

192
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,380
I reduced it to one page because I don't
agree that much

193
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,689
when I'm gonna do here's point out
certain decision paths

194
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,860
you know are read this one out to you
Easter with an ongoing investigation

195
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,100
you determine if you want telephonic
evidence the type of evidence he won its

196
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,930
content so the instrument you must use a
title three order which means you have

197
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,530
to meet the full requirements

198
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,670
up the title three to get that order if
you can't meet the requirements you can

199
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,380
establish probable cause you can't
convince a magistrate that you can

200
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,100
minimize

201
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,380
the search you don't get it as law
enforcement

202
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,510
I might go a little bit

203
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,600
more quickly through this one I want to
point out that there are exceptions to

204
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,950
the

205
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,380
title3 protections are offered your you
know all this of course is public

206
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,100
information if you want to know the
details

207
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,110
it's out there yousef

208
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:47,110
if you wanna look it up its in Title 18
the US Code sections 25-10 25-22

209
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,240
I recommend Cornell laws Legal
Information Institute

210
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,440
they have a nice easy to use site for
final

211
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,640
the click-through those killers who
cares

212
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,240
here's the important part title3 has a
statutory suppression mechanism

213
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,020
if you violate Title 3 you don't get to
use the evidence

214
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,560
it says so it's the law it's not just a
good idea and it's not just to fit a

215
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,050
peak

216
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,540
judge I'm really wrench or cared only
about that can trap we all know about

217
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,780
that right

218
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,819
basically that's a transmittal
information on the telephone

219
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:24,870
I'll

220
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,199
with the Patriot Act deal it redefine
certain aspects to this previously

221
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:30,980
established in laws that we had

222
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,900
it allowed the government to collect
more information in some cases very

223
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,069
reasonable

224
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:38,810
it updated the types of information and
it didn't violate the trends that we've

225
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,660
established in laws

226
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,459
not in all cases

227
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,180
one other thing to clear up his
long-standing debate about voicemail

228
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,770
what is voicemails stored electronic
communication or is a telephonic content

229
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,620
right Patriot Act to find that frankly
I'd rather live without the confusion in

230
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,990
my life

231
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,770
and best of all it continue the
protections that would reasonably be

232
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,050
extended to it

233
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:08,449
course I'm not a litigator cell you know

234
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:11,370
regular search warrant elements are
trying to clean up with you learn

235
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,329
elsewhere

236
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:15,640
here it is what did Patriot Act expand

237
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,160
in some the basic subscriber information
again this is not content

238
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,260
these are the terms of service that you
have with the third party provider like

239
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,579
an ISP

240
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:28,089
they can now obtain the link the service
the types of services you subscribe to

241
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:29,079
our use

242
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,209
temporary assigned network addresses

243
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:36,480
dynamic IP's in the means and source a
payment

244
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,110
meaning the money trail back to you

245
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,150
ECPA I'll deal with this quickly

246
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:50,600
basically three kinds of information
subscriber information we went over

247
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,920
above

248
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,870
records or logs maintained by the
provider about you

249
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,680
and finally the contents

250
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,040
me ECPA was good for us

251
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,569
it protected us from having information
released by a third party

252
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:11,610
service providers it increase the burden
on law enforcement clarify their duties

253
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,040
in many cases

254
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,860
if you want content you still need to
get a search warrant you still have to

255
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,310
meet probable cause

256
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,870
it does not provide a statutory
suppression remedy of course

257
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,920
constitutional violations

258
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,920
or nearly result suppression of evidence
wrongfully obtained blah blah blah

259
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:38,020
lasting voluntary disclosure third-party
providers

260
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,910
public providers are not allowed to
release your information voluntarily

261
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,180
formerly now

262
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,720
private providers like you know if you
have a company can see you work for AT&T

263
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,990
your email account may be provided to
law enforcement if you

264
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,270
subscribe to a service provided by AT&T
you pay for it

265
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:03,620
they may not disclose it until patriot

266
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,980
there were some recognized exceptions to
that for example the sub child

267
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,410
protection sexual predator punishment
act

268
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,589
you and I I don't know if everybody
would agree but it seems like a

269
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:13,740
reasonable

270
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,660
I'm willing to give up my rights for
that as long as its use for that as long

271
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,670
as its monitored

272
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,630
you may not be and I don't insist that
you be

273
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,640
I'm in a really tough here because I
wanna drill down a slide I think I'm

274
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,079
encroaching on some other people's time
there

275
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,240
disclosure may be voluntary right
formally it was not wasn't allowed under

276
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,310
the CPA

277
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,380
thanks to Patriot disclosure may be
voluntary

278
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,209
if ECPA 2702 be or USA PATRIOT Act

279
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,670
section 212 4505 exist basically that's

280
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,910
if someone in a very nebulous way
decides you might be a threat to

281
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,260
national security

282
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,189
if you are a cyber terrorists for
incident for instance

283
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:56,969
right what does it take to get labeled
the cyber terrorist

284
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,049
I'm probably one right now I mean just
standing here talking to you I'm pretty

285
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,189
sure

286
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:05,380
that someone would consider me a cyber
terrorists for enabling you by teaching

287
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,839
about search-and-seizure law

288
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,939
so it is worrisome but

289
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:13,939
to understand the real threat a patriot
you have to understand

290
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,510
all the legislation and modified where
the first drafts a patriot

291
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,329
simply removed a couple words from

292
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:24,350
some adult laws protecting us in reduced
the protections

293
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,600
for content down to the same as they are
for a pen register

294
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,720
for transmittal information that one got
shot down thank goodness

295
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,470
but it only takes a couple words in
nobody really understands ability no

296
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,799
all the underlying legislation is behind
it I certainly don't

297
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,880
but in this one nearly area you know I i
hope i laid out for you here

298
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,880
and I'm over

299
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,309
wendy is still putting her sides
together

300
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:09,959
this is an amazing race against time
think

301
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,230
I completed my graphic here good but see
how fast you can type the word trademark

302
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:22,230
you are it

303
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,240
here because me

304
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,460
this presentation is really going to be
questions and answers from you in the

305
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,080
audience

306
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,679
so as the slider getting them up online

307
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,140
I can when the Seltzer

308
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:12,140
Electronic Frontier Foundation I wanna
now 8 staff attorneys and

309
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,400
thanks and thanks especially to

310
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,970
you because it's our members that make
us strong its contributions from our

311
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,210
members that keep us

312
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,480
nonprofit organization go so

313
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,130
thank you thanks to love you look stop
by and I love you were planning to stop

314
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,570
by our table in the back

315
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,300
now 12 protecting your online right

316
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,919
there too important components to
protecting

317
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,260
your rights online and you're right
that's first

318
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,870
know the law and second know your rights
now another

319
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,920
reverse engineering his a minefield

320
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,740
reverse engineering is the freedom to
tinker to understand to enter operate

321
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,450
innovate to discover but it's under
attack from

322
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,310
laws like the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act

323
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,889
thank you

324
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:19,600
pecans

325
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,460
premium CA pretty much had the right to

326
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,190
takoma product and tinker with it and
figure out how it worked

327
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:31,520
you had bought it it was yours and you
could play with and you could open it up

328
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,310
and you could discover the schematic
even if the television manufacture

329
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:40,310
provide them to you the machine and you
could discover how the early computers

330
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,270
you could discover computer software
because you might even be given the

331
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:48,790
source code well potential 1 a.m.
Copyright Act

332
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:52,420
gives publishers a new way to lock up
content

333
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,990
and to prevent you from tinkering with
it to discover how it works

334
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,210
discover how the players work all in the
name of preventing piracy

335
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,980
digital media so preventing
circumvention

336
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,290
technological protection measures means
that the movie studios

337
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,710
can tell you how to build your DVD
player I can tell you that no you can't

338
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,240
watch

339
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,340
DVD's on a system powered by the Linux
operating system no you can't watch

340
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,990
DVD's from Europe

341
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,590
on the same machine that you watch your
American DVD's

342
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,159
BFF defended 2600 magazine

343
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,290
a few years ago 2600 published linked to
the code

344
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,909
DCSS in news reports telling people

345
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,260
this fabled security system from the
movie studios

346
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,340
is pretty weak here get around here's
how you could play DVD's on an open

347
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,899
source operating system

348
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:53,240
the movie studios and the court said

349
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,000
that's really what the law says really
does prohibit

350
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,100
tinkering with your entertainment system
lost

351
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:10,100
that case but we haven't stopped
fighting the law

352
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,260
we helped professor and felt in his

353
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,520
research team in after the heck is TMI
contest when they were told

354
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,360
first that they couldn't publish their
results because that might be

355
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,490
circumventing

356
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,530
the watermark on digital music samples

357
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,540
eventually they were allowed to publish
their research a funny way

358
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,280
book packing the Xboxes available at the
back at the room

359
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,410
from no starch press initially he tried
to go with

360
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,679
dip a different publisher while he was
afraid

361
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,870
that Microsoft might come after them
under the DMCA

362
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,330
because hacking the xboxs might be they
thought

363
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,360
team to circumvent

364
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,750
technological protection measures system
we

365
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,630
we work confident that

366
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,250
this book was serious work

367
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,320
technology and research and willing to
defend it if it came to court

368
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,350
court over that DMCA threat and
Microsoft to its credit

369
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,150
hasn't threatened under the DMCA the
very

370
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,470
authors have to ask their lawyers

371
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,580
before bringing technology in research
publication is

372
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,070
a scary trent Bakery Square

373
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,750
Alex Halderman other people me tree was
thrown in jail

374
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,280
a few for several months after
demonstrating make

375
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,428
in securities Adobe's ebook

376
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:45,760
encryption Alex Halderman got threatened

377
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,640
threats when he published some the new
copy protected CDC's

378
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,030
could be the copy protection could be
avoided if you simply hold down the

379
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,620
shift key on your computer

380
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,850
when you put the CD into the dry you get
one of those media com

381
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,559
CDs hold shift the first time you load
it up

382
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,540
because otherwise it's going to take
over your operating system and

383
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,850
for for 10 to prevent the copying

384
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,280
he got threat letters over saying hold
down the shift key

385
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:21,780
engineering

386
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,320
we also find it threatened by click rap
contracts

387
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,399
be end user license agreements

388
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,870
pages and pages or screens and screens

389
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,440
legalese that come up the front up
software packages

390
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,580
often claim to from

391
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,480
reverse engineering and we're still
fighting in the courts again on

392
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,390
whether companies can take by contract
copyright law doesn't give

393
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,270
copyright law doesn't protect facts

394
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,520
it doesn't protect methods and processes

395
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,600
but companies are trying through
contract

396
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,900
to lock those things up again to prevent
you from figuring out

397
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,750
hell an online game works we've been
defending

398
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,429
the creators at the net the project open
source game server that interoperate

399
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:13,880
with

400
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,340
lizards Warcraft and Starcraft they
wanted to give people a different place

401
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,790
to play games online

402
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,690
they read the protocol is it was

403
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,380
going over the network day looked at the
way their games functioned

404
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,919
and without copying any lizards they
built their own

405
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,179
game server to work with games that
people had purchased

406
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:38,419
blizzards any saying that this was

407
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:42,559
circumvention technological protections
and

408
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,428
breach of the contract they click
through when installing the game

409
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:50,159
on their machine are still fighting that
case

410
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,159
as well hoping to win a victory there

411
00:24:53,159 --> 00:25:00,159
for reverse engineering as fair use on
the flip side

412
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,400
although there are lots of ways that you
can get tangled up in the law

413
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,480
we also can Canton

414
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,030
continue to fight if you know your
rights and

415
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,070
know that despite day entangling
tentacles

416
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,158
on corporate interpretations of the law
not all of those

417
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,470
interpretations are correct

418
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,750
just because somebody says in a fancy
lawyer letter doesn't mean it's true

419
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,340
we we have won several victories

420
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,540
proclaiming the first amendment protects
code as speech

421
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,750
the government can't lock up encryption
code

422
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,780
by claiming that pizza munition

423
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,950
to be controlled by export controls

424
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,450
Co the DIS describing the way an
encryption system works

425
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,270
speech that's fully protected under the
First Amendment the court recognized

426
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,100
that

427
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,290
even as they were trying to lock up
pieces code

428
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:02,830
anti circumvention devices this is

429
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,730
an important precedent and one that
we're going to keep pushing forward

430
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,210
copyright doesn't protect

431
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,960
systems processes and methods operation
just because

432
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,620
someone has a copyright doesn't mean
that they get to control

433
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,700
everything you do with a piece of
software

434
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,030
over the piece of technology

435
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:31,809
copyright law still permits you to
figure out how the technology works

436
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:34,928
as long as your

437
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:38,530
being careful to avoid the anti
circumvention

438
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,639
copyright law still has fair use
exception so

439
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,640
still if you want to criticize a book or
a movie

440
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,370
you can take an excerpt from that and
included in your own negative review

441
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:55,419
and no matter how nestle they come after
you

442
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:59,630
you can you can assert fair use rights

443
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,850
and these rights are under attack as
much because people's

444
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,790
aren't asserting as because corporations
are bearing down

445
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,040
saying they don't exist if you're an
author

446
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,399
encourage your publisher to understand
fair use

447
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,909
understand that you don't need to ask
permission to take a 10 line quotation

448
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,649
from a book

449
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:26,570
understand if you're making online
multimedia art

450
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,990
but if you want to take took like a
scene from a movie

451
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,559
a few frames is fair use

452
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,860
trademark lansbury exceptions to if
you're not using

453
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,370
the trademark to promote a committee
competing product or you're not using it

454
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,850
to mislead somebody

455
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,240
that the trademark owner endorses your
site you can still set up a website that

456
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:54,240
says Verizon really sucks

457
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,490
a couple other projects that we can take
on

458
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:08,100
right now I currently in congress is the
digital media consumer

459
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,220
Rights Act DMC re: that's

460
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:18,470
effort sponsored by representative rick
Belcher Virginia

461
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,630
give him credit for that it saying

462
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,950
fair use rights back into the DMCA
saying instead of leading publishers

463
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,679
lock up more than copyright law gives
them

464
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,250
let's say that it's not against the law
to circumvent or to help someone

465
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,070
circumvent

466
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,559
for the purposes of fair use if you

467
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,240
same that if you produce tools that help
people make

468
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,679
fair use up their books on their videos
their music

469
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,690
those tools should be within the law

470
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:53,280
not outside the way the DMCA

471
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,059
and finally also encourage you to come

472
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:01,540
check out yes digital television
Liberation Front

473
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,010
because we have one-year until the
broadcast flag

474
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,830
takes effect on high-definition digital
television

475
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,668
and in that one year period you can buy

476
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:16,200
to your devices that are fully capable
of recording and outputting

477
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,510
high-quality digital signals as soon as
June 1st 2005

478
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,340
rolls around you won't be able to do
that broadcast flag

479
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,070
mandate is a sweeping technology M&A

480
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:31,120
said any technology inter operates

481
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,530
any technology that receives Andy
modulates

482
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,399
a digital television signal must be up
broadcast

483
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,540
one compliant and robust against use or
modification

484
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,389
so that means no tinkering no finding
out how it works no finding out how to

485
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,679
win

486
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,790
extract the full high-definition signal

487
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,780
and even know using that to your and
with open source software

488
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,940
that might not that might be modified
not to respect the broadcast

489
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,399
but there are two years being made now
and

490
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,060
visit the FF site we've got a broadcast
flag page

491
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,310

broadcast flag and get the most

492
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:17,310
your television signals

493
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,040
time for questions I have

494
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:33,040
that one more presentation

495
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:54,559
call again only manly

496
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:01,340
first policy analyst Electronic Frontier

497
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,169
today talk to you two issues yep

498
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,960
works on near and dear to my heart
obscenity anonymity

499
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,960
and basically I want to talk about the
current legal connections between these

500
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:20,809
two issues

501
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:23,979
historically of pride has been connected

502
00:31:23,979 --> 00:31:27,169
Senate you should be a lot

503
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:30,249
like these days

504
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:33,700
anonymity especially much more

505
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,659
current legal cases that

506
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:44,539
concerned any talk about basically

507
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:47,989
the question whether or not you're able
to

508
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,210
look at it materials online and when you
do

509
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,379
whether or not you can remain anonymous
or if you're putting

510
00:31:54,379 --> 00:32:00,529
materials yourself I think it's obvious
why people dealing with see Materials

511
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:03,869
what but I'll talk later

512
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:09,200
why other reasons why you might also
want basically a couple

513
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,509
court issues are making a possible

514
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:16,429
which is the primary category

515
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:19,639
speech to get to find seen me actually

516
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:25,169
break line in SA and

517
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:30,340
yeah how work how is it

518
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,950
porn could break your on it all boils
down to something called community

519
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,059
standards I put in red

520
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,039
remember red light behind on

521
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:44,229
most obscenity is defined I get into the
legal definition

522
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:48,940
minute most is defined in terms
community standards there's

523
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,450
no United States national standard seen

524
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,989
on the idea is that that would prevent
us from having

525
00:32:55,989 --> 00:33:00,409
lowest-common-denominator standard seen
the most conservative

526
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:03,649
most fearful sexual expect extra

527
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:08,539
exc Tory images basically a sec

528
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:12,200
shit okay people I X

529
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,190
Tory I don't know why maybe felix
Vicious basically the

530
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,580
38 to prevent the community that most
disturbed by issues from setting

531
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,749
nation in the past

532
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:28,799
courts don't syndicated

533
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,220
sense because obscenity is generally
been magazine

534
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,649
stories %uh videos being sold stores

535
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:39,700
there was a local community that could
set a standard

536
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,879
know in our community don't wanna images

537
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:45,929
Cisco okay

538
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:52,929
which it the quest

539
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:58,859
become course how do you determine

540
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:01,970
community standards internet right
because

541
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,729
do you think the internet itself is a
community standard

542
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:09,389
there's one community on the Internet
which case how do we decide

543
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:13,849
that community's ability to deal with
images

544
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:16,980
seen expression the other thing

545
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:23,719
difficult about that say I'm an adult
webmaster website has materials on

546
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,789
could possibly be seen I have no way of
knowing

547
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:32,029
what communities people are coming from
I can say

548
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,049
well dispersed your first Jersey

549
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:39,520
Jersey do although this is actually
changing

550
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,819
course the other key a lot of people

551
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:47,409
wants to be so they don't even if I

552
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,779
would figure New York

553
00:34:50,779 --> 00:34:54,250
Jersey they don't want me to taking tech
watched

554
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:59,150
you think make it extremely difficult to
determine

555
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:06,150
what community standard Senate be on so
just keep that in the back of your mind

556
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,190
if I take you on a quick two or three
definitions

557
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,710
fabulous court

558
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:19,200
not people talk about it

559
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,260
any what they're talking about is a
former expression which illegal

560
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,680
okay not ever alright have materials

561
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,779
and must be

562
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:33,569
sexual or excretory nature I did it

563
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:40,569
and and thank you you can alter
gradually

564
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,098
later so there's there's three prong

565
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:50,150
to the so-called Miller which came out
case California 1973

566
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,180
first must appeal to the free interest

567
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,940
average person I'm basing on community
standards

568
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,930
have to be different interest in San
Francisco first

569
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,618
because people in a lot very different
sexual appetite

570
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:08,650
very interested mean

571
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,980
it turns it must contain

572
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,720
been sex and or excretion again

573
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,910
based on contemporary community
standards there's always been

574
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,149
controversy on

575
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,900
offensive mean the answer is generally I
know it when I see it

576
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,180
and again all based on what you believe
that your community

577
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,919
would consider also in the famous

578
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,260
provisioning Miller flap for vision

579
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,730
can have no social literary or artistic
value taken as a whole

580
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:43,359
so that means that you have to look at
the whole you can't say

581
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,750
because there's like hardcore but one
seen

582
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,730
the entire book is obscene you have to
say actually

583
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,260
considering day 16

584
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,299
political issue yeah

585
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:03,700
the whole book is just

586
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,329
that Miller and again those standards
are you all the time

587
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:10,990
for determining what seen I'm now
there's another important case to

588
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,770
consider

589
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,890
which impact comes later in 1982

590
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,558
New York spur for case basically just me

591
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:21,849
all child pornography

592
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:25,619
now it's important to remember
especially since we just recently had

593
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,900
child morphing which to get struck down

594
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,309
all this mean people under 18 are not
allowed to be in

595
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:35,730
be it's basically at a child
exploitation

596
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:42,160
I think week no kids should be forced

597
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,290
if but if your child fictional
representation

598
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:50,940
making up

599
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,049
more images teenagers

600
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:59,150
teenagers it's just UN Photoshop program

601
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,380
it may not be and the final amendment

602
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,770
that is that their case

603
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,000
pacifica case which stated that
broadcast

604
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,390
are not subject to the same much more
strongly regulated

605
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,529
fucking scene in the book radio

606
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:22,630
okay to read any case we've been
concerned about

607
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,859
one is ask Supreme Court just

608
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:30,359
a couple of weeks ago about the Copa
case

609
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,598
Supreme Court upheld injunction against

610
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,359
forcing the case basically the child
Online Protection Act

611
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:42,910
create kinda Miller test what is it seen
on the Internet

612
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,509
but it bad harmful to minors to the

613
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:50,869
state each prong have to keep your
interest

614
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:54,240
miners print no social

615
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,869
to miners and also

616
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,789
what it does anyone me

617
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:05,900
how missed also marquee

618
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,270
providing kind expression

619
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,299
there somehow deemed harmful to minors
those people

620
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:15,710
find and possibly

621
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,770
so there's that

622
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,890
case which is very interesting

623
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,078
and the other came all

624
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,339
which is actually currently in process

625
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:31,680
is for Nikki's case

626
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,649
New York artistic lot pictures people
having

627
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,520
funded it's pretty tame new yorkers

628
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,230
step but for a lot of people iraq

629
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,319
not cities there's been concerns

630
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:52,359
maybe seen so what nikki is Dennis
preemptively challenged

631
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:56,089
any provision at all communications
decency act

632
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:59,880
which he thought last but indeed we have

633
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,589
because all that struck down DC

634
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:07,930
not the obscenity and her questions
specifically in this case

635
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,730
typically involve West question

636
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,230
how she you know make sure that

637
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:19,200
communities team work obscene can't get
ahold

638
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,410
appointed other webmasters having images
on our site

639
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,058
no way of knowing coming to your site so
why should the burden beyond

640
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:30,089
her shift

641
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:33,250
County Tennessee decide you know

642
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:40,250
pictures women pony

643
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:44,750
alright let's talk a little bit about
anonymity and rapid

644
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,779
the Supreme Court has interpreted the
first amendment to mean that

645
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:51,579
everyone has the right it's free speech
this includes

646
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:55,660
speech you'll see how this pornography
in a minute

647
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,399
I'm when anonymity online just a quick
refresher course for the

648
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,759
have Rd avail yourself

649
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:08,000
greatly you can use it

650
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,140
to do almost anything online except buy
things

651
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,808
credit card actually you could be

652
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:20,640
credit card again

653
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,940
then there's also being geographically
anonymous missus obviously very

654
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,079
important in terms of this community
standards issues

655
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:31,339
nobody knows where you're coming from
I'm you can register for services this

656
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:32,119
message

657
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:36,079
with the I can you can register for
services

658
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,579
without giving personally identifiable
information

659
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:43,880
including getting a domain name I can be
changed

660
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,529
and also you have to remember that all
the things that we take for granted

661
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:48,809
online now about being anonymous

662
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:52,619
they've never been explicitly granted

663
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:57,000
lot simply people interpreting with the
Supreme Court are you said

664
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,380
free speech non-evidence explicitly
interpreted online

665
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,369
contact there's no affirmative ruling
saying absolutely yes

666
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:07,730
you have the right to be

667
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,029
we just art so this

668
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:15,500
obscenity ruling they're coming up made
break

669
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,089
so much in nikky Case

670
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:23,540
one of the things that come up course
that case is the possibility that

671
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,670
order to enforce community standards
webmasters like Nicki

672
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,839
other adult webmasters will be forced to
use geolocation software

673
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,989
to figure out the the community's where

674
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:38,040
people are coming from stop

675
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,770
there in a community that is not allowed
to view this kind of sexual material

676
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:46,460
turned away now there's a way to get
around that if you're using

677
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,619
proxy but a lot geolocation

678
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:54,329
set up to detect proxies and well all
also people are encouraged to

679
00:42:54,329 --> 00:42:57,849
turn visitors were using way

680
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:01,710
website so that the concern is that

681
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,150
soon you will not be geographically line
especially if you want to access

682
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,170
unpopular speech or speech that might be
deemed

683
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,799
seen by your local community the other
thing is that in the Copa ruling

684
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:18,410
wanted thing that I just Kennedy said in
his decision two weeks ago

685
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:23,140
with that reason why the court with
upholding the injunction against

686
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,239
forcing right away is that they're other

687
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,839
less restrictive way preventing minors
gaining access to

688
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:34,540
harmful materials specifically dimension
over and over

689
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:38,349
Spencer Ware and filtering software year
old friends from

690
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,799
public libraries New York City which
keep you from looking at things like

691
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,020
breast cancer website

692
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,210
and other great stuff has not a word

693
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:50,980
so basically the problem is that if you
have regime

694
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:55,109
where instead censoring website source
for having

695
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:58,910
potentially harmful material stead what
you do is answer it

696
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,629
endpoint built or sensor where

697
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,170
the only way that for example your
library

698
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,809
where the only way you can get around
actually physically walked up to the

699
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:11,279
library and

700
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:15,239
please turn of

701
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:21,270
website altered which kinda break people

702
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,720
so that actually a really big issue also
course filtering software can be used to

703
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,549
identify

704
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:31,770
I just noted at the bottom that wanted
the way things will be enforced

705
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,200
people disseminating unpopular material

706
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,710
potentially material will be punished if
they are

707
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:42,500
for example allowing for situations they
filter

708
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,819
and I'm

709
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,910
I think that speaks for itself

710
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:53,078
and I just wanted to conclude with a
quick to do list for hackers who are

711
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:54,500
concerned about

712
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,660
maintaining anonymity and also
maintaining people's ability to engage

713
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:01,890
free unfettered speech online

714
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,900
first ball you can help develop

715
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,880
a proxy services like which allow people
to surf the Web anonymously so they

716
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,130
they do go to website using geolocation
software

717
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,329
it won't know where you're coming from
but someone coming from New York

718
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:20,380
when you're actually coming from alaska

719
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,980
you can also help set up anonymous Fri
mailers so that people can stand on it

720
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,650
that way

721
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,109
I'd be very very interested anybody
would like to help out

722
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:33,150
finding ways to sabotage geolocation
software

723
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,829
want things about you allegations of
right now is that

724
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:40,500
it also involved data mining and so
sometimes here

725
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,829
say feeling in your zip code on line is
dealing Casey services will find out

726
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:49,480
what your zip code is correlated with
your IP address and then they will

727
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,480
correlate IP block so that you actually
give away

728
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,859
geographical location other people using
your I if you're using your IP block

729
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:02,500
because the poorly together stay 45
people using the same

730
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,150
St correlate that with your zip code

731
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,520
there's ninety-five percent probability
people from

732
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,150
here and

733
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,569
so I'd really like to find out ways
around

734
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:19,808
I'm and finally please if you have a
hosting service

735
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:23,759
you have the ability to do this host
unpopular speech

736
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:27,650
please post anonymous popular state on
your site

737
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:31,150
if people were trying to disseminate
unpopular ideas

738
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:34,839
or ideas that might be considered
obscene community need as much help as

739
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:35,808
they can get

740
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:39,059
we have some great pornographers here
the conference today that really need

741
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:39,970
support

742
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:45,099
the guy the

743
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:49,859
I'd said to the people do haxor that's
public three-act

744
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:53,710
other floating around they have DVD's
are very sexy

745
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,960
the woman who runs vegetarian porn
website

746
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,960
for not comments here so did your
support

747
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,869
they're out there on the front lines
fighting for free speech fighting for

748
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:06,339
your right to get

749
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:13,339
the

750
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:18,209
so we can take questions after about 10
minutes

751
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:21,368
two-minute okay

752
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:28,369
ask too many questions

753
00:47:29,149 --> 00:47:33,249
question about reverse engineering more
good

754
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:40,249
a question

755
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:45,589
basher courses taught a great things
last few years he can't be the only year

756
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:49,429
cognizant representative we have is
there any way to share

757
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:54,130
somebody congressmen senators offices a
plus or minus rating for

758
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,079
where we can for our efforts for helping
educate men writing letters and emails

759
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:58,929
and trying to get some

760
00:47:58,929 --> 00:48:05,929
education and their an Action Center
where we try to

761
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:10,789
invite people anyone to come to action
not

762
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:14,339
FF .org and we've gotten engine behind

763
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:17,359
that will send your comments to

764
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,828
York congressional offices encouraging

765
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:25,329
for example encouraging them to
cosponsor about your doolittle bill

766
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:28,369
a few others representatives

767
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:33,699
doolittle Martin and others have signed
on to that bill

768
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:37,249
and the more support they hear from
their constituents for this

769
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:40,519
positions the more likely they are to
realise

770
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:43,579
Hollywood isn't the only one with an
interest in these fights

771
00:48:43,579 --> 00:48:50,579
my question is

772
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,759
if you run a free knit know it on your

773
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:58,159
machine are you currently in violation
of any law

774
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,659
and other any laws that are about to be
passed that would

775
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:04,829
make it a violation to run a free knit
night

776
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:09,429
you know what Freenet sure I do know it
for a net is

777
00:49:09,429 --> 00:49:13,309
bring it is so great anonymous hosting
and browsing

778
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:16,589
service and a protocol that allows

779
00:49:16,589 --> 00:49:20,189
you to build anonymous applications on
top of it I'm I'd

780
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:24,629
I'm not I believe that using free net is
entirely legal and

781
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:29,349
hosting a free net node is entirely
legal this is a piece of software with

782
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:31,679
substantial non-infringing uses

783
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,479
and substantial lawful use is allowing
dissidence to get their voices heard

784
00:49:36,479 --> 00:49:40,149
I'm and so under current law

785
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:44,069
thats fine and dandy under something
scary thats

786
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:47,799
circulating in Congress called the
induce act our

787
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:51,880
it was called the induce act now it's
called the inducing infringement of

788
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,609
copyright

789
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:56,249
act ot that could be deemed to be aiding
and abetting

790
00:49:56,249 --> 00:50:00,229
copyright infringement at so might

791
00:50:00,229 --> 00:50:04,769
be under more question sup if you're
looking for something to do you can call

792
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:05,239
up your

793
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:09,079
senators offices and ask that they
oppose

794
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,529
the inducing infringement of copyright
act but for now free net is legal and

795
00:50:13,529 --> 00:50:18,869
a great project recently there's

796
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:22,319
in court ruling that if you stopped on
the street yet tell the cop

797
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,630
your name as curious you guys know lot
the atomic for namely a first name

798
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:30,179
and as I've known as cures give you a
quick rundown like what's changed since

799
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:31,059
it's to Katie

800
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:34,919
from like the busy authority you know as
far as like what you do today

801
00:50:34,919 --> 00:50:41,769
rates when you're stopped on the street
speak

802
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:45,039
had no case you have to provide

803
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,769
its state law requires it woody

804
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:52,669
low okay it on with a high bill case

805
00:50:52,669 --> 00:50:55,989
and you have to provide record name a
state law requires it basically what the

806
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:59,329
court said was that states may pass laws
that require that

807
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:02,529
so it you know your mileage may vary
depending on where you're from

808
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:06,119
what are your rights when stopped on the
street

809
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,559
idea about three days on that stop and
frisk

810
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,019
is pretty you'd be surprised what the
standard is for shaking you down

811
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:18,119
in how easy it is to mistake a small

812
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:21,130
bag of marijuana for a large handgun

813
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:28,130
then search cases it actually go through
thank you

814
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:32,689
a we'd been told that it's time for the
next trip to move in appreciate your

815
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:33,709
attendance and

816
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:36,409
thanks a lot the
