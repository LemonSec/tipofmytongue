1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:03,820
more and future

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,509
so what is OS

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,800
in like 20 well it's been around for a
little while

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,460
now be four a map people were doing OS
fingerprinting already

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,740
by doing things like tell Maddie to the
host

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,369
and looking at what kinda OST mission
was coming back from the banners

7
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,019
so it's not like OS fingerprinting
started

8
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,160
a map mile there's also me in your work
on our sins which is

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,100
three things like looking up postings
you know

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,969
email questions by people who work in
certain places saying all you know I'm

11
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,070
having problem with my ass

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,000
boson what can I do in you look at where
they posted this palm

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,120
home that place is using so personal
things like that out

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,370
in northern peso

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,949
came out and did after fingerprinting
techniques

16
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:11,039
really were the first people that do
that in they did a really good job

17
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:15,189
because 2002 it took those techniques
and develop

18
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:20,859
further into and now along with more
after fingerprinting technique and

19
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:21,380
dollars

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,149
really good as well passive
finger-pointing is a little bit

21
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,889
different

22
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:30,609
ideas the same but its you started using

23
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:34,099
after solicitation responses were
looking up

24
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,590
passive so you're sitting in sniffing

25
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,079
traffic does coming from someone else
and you find a big ol

26
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:47,880
what they are based on what you see and
we have timing analysis

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,329
which is pretty clever I think and

28
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,399
there was a proof-of-concept school

29
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,799
that came are called ring and the
authors

30
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,849
well a white paper they didn't

31
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:06,729
police ring solos with a concert but it
was still very good idea

32
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:11,019
because they say okay well what happens
if someone sons of

33
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:15,579
a response to a simpler happier we send
and we'd drop

34
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:20,290
and how long does it take before they
send another one

35
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,069
in only two of it in how long to take
sole

36
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:28,099
then we measure the time in between the
packets and based on that information we

37
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:28,840
can figure all

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,840
what they are so I kinda have covered
the history a little bit on the last

39
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,739
slide

40
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,239
but here's just to clarify k so

41
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,530
came out for Syneron you know and map

42
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,299
developed technique further and added
some new techniques

43
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,959
in them passive loss finger-pointing and

44
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,500
dunno for our can follow light oh you
know what happens if we

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,530
use ICMP packets to after

46
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,780
fingerprinting to see what be respond to
i cnt

47
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,079
missional happen so that I was also
really good

48
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,720
in ring

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,790
so why do you even care about defeating
OS fingerprinting

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,739
how many people in here had Don hunt us
or vulnerability assessment the poor

51
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,920
okay so some people have arm

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,990
when you go and you do one of those
perhaps you cannot stop into not working

53
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,030
you say okay

54
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,200
arm or you could do it remotely the
pending

55
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,440
you say okay wall what I wanna find all

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,920
I wanna find out as much information
about that not work with the host

57
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,900
as possible so you sit there you sale
paywall

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,600
let me do the scan on their host see

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,100
what ports open what they are also

60
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,150
that what they are information is

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,490
really important because that's what
you're gonna use

62
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,110
to look at your Arsenal your sports and
decide what you gonna use

63
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:10,770
against them so us one of the most
important pieces I meet mission that you

64
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,060
can

65
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,000
yet about her target post 0 us now our
scanners

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,589
exploit armhole so worst behavior

67
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:25,020
you know what I mean by that is you know

68
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,219
where you have TCP implementation RFC
793

69
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,090
is size okay if you know you do

70
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,000
arson path you respond with us in our or
something in

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,710
it %uh supplies how you respond to
certain types a path

72
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:45,700
that's really important except that it
doesn't give

73
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,990
details about every single big so there
are

74
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,200
lhasa papillion combinations for example

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,000
arson been urged course that if thou was
sent to the remote host

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,410
you know the staff implementation
wouldn't necessarily know

77
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,000
what to do with it so that's a pop

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,370
in Seoul arm every single vendor

79
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,220
duster staff implementation different in
doubt

80
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,340
these honesty by the last

81
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,780
and in return you know about the solar
scanners being able to figure out what

82
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,270
they are

83
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,710
based on their behavior but I don't want
to like dole weighty

84
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,460
you know this is the vendors fault
because it's not necessarily entirely

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,909
under spot they do the best they can but
in reality

86
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,900
RFC 793 doesn't specify

87
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,580
if you get a in packet it snappy how are
you

88
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,150
you should respond to it so for example
Windows

89
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,560
just up in Paterson batteries but if
OpenBSD get something packet

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,400
it's a softer facet doesn't respond so

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,010
I think there may need to be some
tightening down on some

92
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,610
you know artsy not really entirely

93
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,039
vendors I so now we get to more

94
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,890
what is more wall I wanted more

95
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:22,120
to be a user Lampasas now allows a user
to select whether they want to be

96
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,630
right now the implementation allows you
to select whether you want to be

97
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,750
OpenBSD Windows 2000 you cancel our
planet's yeah

98
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,419
but I plan to implement now

99
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,580
Hurley you can use fall more on a Linux

100
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,320
machine you can't install on any other
OS

101
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,840
and I do plan on implementing insulation
more

102
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,630
OS's a lot more Ford do

103
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,890
is it will hand Pando like olive your
inbound

104
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,580
path dealers and bone himmler an

105
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,710
the penny know what type of packet is

106
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,430
it won't either stunned the packet onto
the carnal

107
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,229
and another call or send the packet
backhaul to outbound himmler

108
00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:11,280
in them to the mojos or

109
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,220
it will reply to Rocky to the mojos from
the inbound hander

110
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,760
if the path is something like you know
Dustin foreclose

111
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,349
poor in are going to a lot more detail
about that later

112
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:26,580
and arm

113
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,639
another thing I wanted to mention as
morbid

114
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,169
definitely not production quality yes so
don't go take morphine install it on

115
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:35,479
your production server

116
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,280
and you know like to be about complaints
about

117
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,280
you know the production server because
it's not there yet

118
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,780
no I predict that it will be for
production servers

119
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,500
arm the idea

120
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,030
well i'd you know it's relatively stable
right now

121
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:07,470
but I really haven't tested it on a
production server so I don't want to

122
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,360
you know you doubt any impression that
it will work on their

123
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,600
as full time line I really don't know

124
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,900
it depends on how busy I am and you know
how much time I have to implement more

125
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,289
for more and I do have a lot of future
plans for

126
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,210
amorphous

127
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,860
BSD license which I thought was the best
way to do it

128
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,940
me and they can be downloaded at the
synapse labs

129
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,940
larger website and actually a sudden my
synopsis for the talk to

130
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,640
more 0.2 is being released by actually
onto

131
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,640
0.3 so there's an axe all

132
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,270
now more first built on packet pro the
Tory library how many people here

133
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,640
were after two o'clock talk okay

134
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,280
all good soul I have some people in your

135
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,380
who already know a packet Pretoria now
packed a purgatory for the benefit of

136
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,540
those who are in here

137
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,630
is some aptos carnival large between the
OS coming on a network interface

138
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,090
and it makes it really easy for me

139
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:25,960
use packet purgatory to build more fun
in fact it probably saved me about 4,000

140
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,250
liza cold which is

141
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,590
me now

142
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,130
happy purgatory is built on Liberty Cap
Dina

143
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,600
summer you know and so into ugly

144
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,960
more thought to use the yeah libertina
more

145
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,790
users Liberty Tap whose in a funny
interface and uses libertina

146
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:52,130
to light wat you gonna live happy and
also to

147
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,420
manipulate the route table file rules
under

148
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,329
about I'll Mon

149
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,360
from a high level architecture
standpoint I'm going to talk about those

150
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,060
some

151
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,560
in ninety going to more detail are more
implementation

152
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,580
you can see that there was a lil mo
holes sending

153
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,790
either a response so ask more

154
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,599
or you know home initiating a connection
to more

155
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,890
so when the response when the remote
host sends the packet

156
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,140
packet purgatory is acting as though
words

157
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,060
and intercepts that path & Sons a long
slow

158
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,959
more involve him and more for look at
their path here and say all

159
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,920
okay on either going to respond to
roughly path to the remote host

160
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,500
or census catheters you know I love

161
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,600
certain type was all go into more detail
later all lower

162
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,220
over to the call right now and help the
condo work on responding to it and wanna

163
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,820
karnal

164
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,870
response to it then ascends about how
and PR have to prove the Tory

165
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,250
again Laveen that path here the package
it's unto the more

166
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,279
outbound himmler in than heads back to
the remote host

167
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,790
and in the next diagram you can see
support felony a little more detail

168
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,779
more in you can see there are more pads
and inbound handler

169
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:28,220
a state table and up on him which those
three components together make up more

170
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,649
so now you to see more detail that when
the Mojo send the packet

171
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,570
and more gets a incise I'll pay wall
last

172
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,360
say those happy is Dustin foreclose port
well sensors

173
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,250
Dustin foreclose poor I don't really
need to send it through to know

174
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,370
post a loss 100 alt just respond to its
wrapping

175
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,899
on the involve him in sale pain while

176
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:57,260
inbound hand the rice a popular response
the penny on the OS that you want to

177
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:57,920
anyway

178
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,930
in that packet does bathroom all holes
now lost say that packet was destined

179
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,320
for

180
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,100
open port sold on morphine bomb hanan
looks at that and say hello hope this is

181
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,170
orson packet

182
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,849
assist us in for open pore I'm going
does

183
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:19,199
you know save Dowson session in the
state table so that I can keep track of

184
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:20,130
the suction

185
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,860
in I'm gonna pass their packet along to
the host alaskan all

186
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,770
which will respond to that package
however the underlying Connell

187
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,829
is going to respond to it stunned about

188
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:37,959
well I'll panhandle which is going to
look at the packet in say

189
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,050
I'm gonna rewrite the relevant parts

190
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,750
up the Hatters to a flock to us that we
want to emulate

191
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:51,750
and then stunned about helpful hopes now
pappy approached the Tory

192
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,920
some love you were at the top so you
know more than idea

193
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,390
but this is more information about pappa
purgatory

194
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,990
those who work avatar and like I
mentioned

195
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,060
arm nope at a private or uses lipke
Kappa libertina

196
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,890
to sniff on the Internet %uh snap on the
interface

197
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,199
in our also duvall table manipulation

198
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,420
file manipulation nada como model

199
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,980
yes the licensing can be downloaded sana

200
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,270
club's website so

201
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,180
nah I'm going to go into detail about
pappa pose a Tory

202
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,470
utilizing sleepy capital if Tina and see
how they are

203
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,110
baths more in terms apart seem old and
new path by law

204
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,190
so arm those who most up at oppose it or
users

205
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,390
there's a party mode and Luca I'll
anymore

206
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,439
we used a proxy mode when

207
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,660
we have a firewall on a host of not
supported by libertina

208
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,670
such as I'll Libby now supports you know
I P chains

209
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,829
Ikea yeah so if you're not using those
file

210
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:10,230
use the past another advantage for the
party mode

211
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,079
cell your file warsaw just yet so I'll

212
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,650
okay but if you're using a loop to I war
mode

213
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:24,650
it back to be your file laws the put out
of the picture

214
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:28,379
okay here it is in detail or proxy mode

215
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:33,189
we can see that will mojos assay with
mojo sons in a packet

216
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:39,209
and in alarm deal lipke caps sniffing

217
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:44,629
on the interface packet purgatory which
is labeled here in those thighs Emma's

218
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:49,409
party I P in party mode so via lipke cap
Sun

219
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:54,299
the path along to the inbound handler or
more and soul

220
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,949
more looks at that path in Las Olas
thoughts and foreclose

221
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:03,209
or so more says OK I'm just gonna
respond directly to the mojos

222
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,479
I'm gonna do a libertina lied he lied.

223
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:10,149
arm back to the remote host suppose

224
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:13,569
poor or if it's for an open port

225
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:16,629
then more for look at it and say okay
arm

226
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:20,259
I'm gonna do a blog I P light deal
libertina

227
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,419
in Thunder packet along to the host a
law school

228
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:27,549
which will respond to that happy an

229
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:33,029
Sun the papilla long in be on the peking
up slipping on the interface

230
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:36,249
on packet posse was stunned

231
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:40,519
happened to al bomb which will then
Revit the packet

232
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,669
2 o'clock I'm laid it all out into a law
I P like yielded

233
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:51,228
not send about moguls sold out in a more
detailed pictures

234
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:57,199
home or office Hanley the path novel
Lubell file mode

235
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,969
were using packet proxy law you know the
holes

236
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:08,059
a law school on getting now happen right
away so lamar host and the path yet

237
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:13,949
and you know now we have papillion
purgatory sitting there as so

238
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:18,819
by law an arm be a low key cap their
packages

239
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:23,759
Sun in bone handle more was looked at
the path in size okay are

240
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,239
I'm either going to do a two-hour
response to the Alamo

241
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,419
mojos like we saw on the last scenario

242
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,459
all we're gonna do a live the not lie

243
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,299
like and send it to the loopback
interface pay an arm

244
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:41,949
if that happens then the whole so last
final response to it

245
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:45,499
and sons it along BR

246
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:49,389
the pick-up slipping on your face and
arm

247
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,449
that path it goes I'll

248
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:56,479
and all palm takes their path it and
does a lot you do not lie

249
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:59,809
this time can't do a vide he lied

250
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:05,250
had done it with no bathroom loopback
interface in Nanaimo horse get a

251
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,700
response

252
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,880
okay

253
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,940
there are some OS skinner's there are
more for four right now

254
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,130
this case so and now at school to

255
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,280
I'm still working on doing a passive OS
fingerprinting

256
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,399
cooling Anderson timing analysis

257
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,750
not have an idea how I would implement
their others

258
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,640
just not implemented right now

259
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,080
I think this work clean up some of the
other two also had tried to follow us

260
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,840
scanners and have north on salsa sauce
bowl

261
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,320
for example their staff Pia which was
written

262
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,299
as they local control module minutes
which made it

263
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:59,470
not portable I didn't like that aspect
of the tour

264
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,559
impossible some all over body because I

265
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,940
Tyler compile stolid thankful

266
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,980
about now I P personality

267
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,820
I liked the fact that it could I'm
really certain alas

268
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,049
again as a patch for the Linux kernel

269
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:22,660
so that makes it not be reportable and

270
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,830
I really was looking for something that
would be portable

271
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,149
and be able to do owe us Malaysian

272
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,270
a sidebar hey you know highlight more

273
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:39,270
and that would do both those I'll be
what I want sold us why more

274
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:46,830
was you know created

275
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,920
alright

276
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,860
now all other current OS fingerprinting
techniques

277
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,510
I can't defeat with more after
finger-pointing

278
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,600
passive finger-pointing timing analysis

279
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,070
acne I think all the city

280
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:11,070
defeated more I know how I would do time
analysis assist not now

281
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,880
before we do this last through the
tunnel

282
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,490
okay so I have those holes here was just
going to be running more

283
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,250
arm for says Windows 2009

284
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,730
as OpenBSD unknown funders holes here
I'm gonna run and map against it you see

285
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,660
on the screen

286
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:51,660
I'll put I'm them

287
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:01,630
runny nose Windows 2000

288
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:08,540
beyond to meet the on here that okay

289
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,540
okay so I'm gonna do that maps can and
just to save some time I'm a pic 10 p.m.

290
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:13,980
por

291
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,980
one close for and our whole system 004

292
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,330
oh I saw now sameness Windows 2000
Windows XP

293
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:39,330
okay so now I'm a changed those houses
August so open BST

294
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:58,890
alright through the skin again

295
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,210
okay so we have OpenBSD arm

296
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,730
now what I'm gonna do is our last stop
on the morphs

297
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,840
in and do a scan on this house again so
you can see that the underlying OS is

298
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Linux

299
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,720
alright sold us to underline hosts
elastin

300
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,720
that's what I've got so far

301
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:05,909
okay so now I'm going to going to a
little bit more detail about the

302
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:06,869
different OS

303
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:11,749
scanning tools and homework deals with
there's case so

304
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:15,119
which I started work because I thought
it was a surplus

305
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,850
school to start with and uses a after
finger pointing technique an ass you son

306
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,119
some Southern packets over to the target
host

307
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,279
all of which are Dustin open ports

308
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,139
pretty simple not too complicated

309
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:35,919
nah I do wanna mention that the OS been
good points on nom

310
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,720
case or outdated I don't think they're
really maintain your very much anymore

311
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,470
only up to the 21 porno okay soul

312
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,529
this is the table that I put together on
homework response okay so packets

313
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:55,769
so you can see on the left hand side
that you know

314
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:58,799
the case or packet types a nap column

315
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,779
in nine the Moore family status is on
the right side

316
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:08,769
end up his sister inbound state table
outbound soul some packets you know such

317
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:09,200
as

318
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,730
been that's an interesting taste because
a

319
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,350
and inbound hando gets up in packet

320
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,549
than a la cena says wall in Miami
elating windows or not has a

321
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:26,299
I am I better be sunny arista now I'm
not only thing when nose and Milan

322
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:27,039
Linate so

323
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,690
opened the st. then I don't respond at
all that path

324
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,029
first then I mention a couple times as
another case

325
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,940
we're more looks at the path in size is
this Dustin for nope importer

326
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,509
close port in a fist Dustin for open
port burn

327
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:47,999
morphs under a long slow O'Connell
withstand

328
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:51,649
walter et al %uh staged a session

329
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:56,109
in the state table so we know that will
use under sin Apple in the Sunda

330
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:59,269
APB out there were no other that was
part of this thing

331
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:05,669
in action asan be very important to
maintain the state arm

332
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:10,039
the other cases are really about
interesting the Sun plus

333
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:14,200
that sucks a plus why why why does
source flags that are

334
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,809
not really used very often like EC on
sold us

335
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:25,809
whatever the emulated alas want to
respond to that

336
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,450
now those explodes to which I really
likes working with because

337
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,659
well I'm looking at you know

338
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,309
I spoke to fingerprints and i'm looking
at a map fingerprint

339
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,849
soon you know I'm a up is very

340
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:44,720
exile about what it takes that's so if
you don't match

341
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,099
is sappy a signature than a stop in know
what you are

342
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:51,349
explode to use I just

343
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:54,599
ingenuity is about it dollars

344
00:24:54,599 --> 00:25:00,269
turnover fuzzy fingerprint larger thing
where it gets back the response in Ercis

345
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:03,909
oh this is a pile a seventy-percent math
so

346
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:07,549
this is the highest probability doubted
the Sola

347
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:13,259
lives sidewall for sporty clobber you
notes platoon of RTOS fingerprinting

348
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:15,419
thing but he's really making it easier
for me

349
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:18,619
hold I'm certain you're going okay

350
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:23,669
I either have to be really it's after I
don't so not having to be really is

351
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:27,220
school exposed to you

352
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,659
is a after fingerprinting at me arms

353
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:34,980
scanner anderson's four different types
of ICMP

354
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,149
packets to the target host one of those
packets that a son

355
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:43,419
is a informational us path which I
thought the heck is that

356
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:47,259
sigh look to you know richest even TCP
IP o's

357
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:50,730
traded volume 1 I just loved up or an

358
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:56,489
wanna stay a sub that information will
cost packet is obsolete like wall

359
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:01,340
who is using obsolete packet that an

360
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,239
silo to at school to spin their plans

361
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:09,450
Michael no no no yeah

362
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:14,509
was to AIS us like no

363
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:20,679
know what that modernized no her you so
that was pretty funny other side okay so

364
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,639
that's why

365
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:25,099
over even bother to put that in there is
because they are

366
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:31,279
absolutely on there so you DP packet the
Sun

367
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,849
as well arm ICMP unreachable

368
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:38,580
not a big deal and the final path is a

369
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,668
analog regular sim Pat with we

370
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:46,679
had already dealt with peso

371
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:53,100
and here's the table explode to and you
can see here that there are for

372
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,020
information

373
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,120
ICMP informational packets la and the
UTPA Anderson

374
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,679
mall so these responses are very
interesting since the ICMP packets are

375
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:05,730
informational

376
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,710
I just heard arm the impound hander
respond directly

377
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,460
to the mojos when they get that type of
packet

378
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,340
no point in passing are you DP

379
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,730
us panel we look at whether the poor
susteren

380
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,230
open four hours close port destination

381
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,779
and respond accordingly in same goes for
the sin

382
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:33,130
I'm now

383
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,429
a chose to go with now on last because
as the most challenging for the reason

384
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:39,809
that I explained earlier

385
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:44,970
period there and I can't tell you how
frustrated I was with you know

386
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:50,640
looking out the case is over and over
again tonight ass over and over again

387
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,270
and getting

388
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,039
all these responses back from a map so
ya know who you are

389
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,500
like I'm only one option of people

390
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,120
well made all the difference

391
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:08,250
fun a male Sun nine different types a
packet to the target host

392
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,370
in for those packets or

393
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,860
for close ports in bible does for open
port so if you've ever run and mapping

394
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,600
you see

395
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,340
masses is like you know hosts a last
prediction is going to be lost be liable

396
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,070
that's probably because I couldn't
either find an open border

397
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,668
close work so in that case it can't go
on like happen this

398
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,799
tests cases which would definitely make
it a lot more on

399
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:37,658
a lot last be liable arm

400
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,990
a map uses the most us cases I love all
the ones that I lost their

401
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,809
and they can be kind of a challenge
sometimes I

402
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:50,350
how to run a lotta TCP down you know

403
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:57,350
at some racism not know what's going on
so here's the table for now

404
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,190
a map and you can see on the law open
port close poor

405
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:08,070
high path if that is sending most of
these cases

406
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,610
obviously all the clothes poor packets
are going to be responded to

407
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,640
by in bal directly arm

408
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,980
I don't think any of these cases really

409
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:26,520
that interesting simpson urged push on
our path with us like no flags

410
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,460
us there

411
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,190
now the more state table

412
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,280
I wanted to talk a little more detail

413
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:43,780
because I really haven't yet to mojos
will send a path and

414
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:50,780
must say you know Sun say happy Scott
sequin number some sort annual ass you

415
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,149
underline the Owasso

416
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:56,789
more random about generating 30 number

417
00:29:56,789 --> 00:29:59,970
according to an email

418
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,140
then your I'm related the last two years
time

419
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,340
only Windows without in you underline
the OS is Linux or BSD

420
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,539
wall Linux and open the SEO a lot more
random

421
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:15,860
a policy numbers to Windows is so how do
we handle

422
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,049
and I think that's a very good example
to use for how the state table

423
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:23,289
news so when that happens

424
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,750
what arm outbound will do

425
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,130
lastly I initiated this ice under said

426
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,870
dual moguls so I'll pound notes about
papito now

427
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:39,470
inside I'll um the underlying hosts
generated you know

428
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,590
wall palmists going to generate a
sequence number but their sequence

429
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,990
number is going to be

430
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,110
define in randomness

431
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:56,340
and online host so I'm going to take the
of that up those two numbers

432
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,450
and stored out of Sir in the state table

433
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:06,540
what I wanna do that's because otherwise
to a mojo sis wanna look at the numbers

434
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,080
and a nap number data

435
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,659
just a on the end on the a national say

436
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,060
all the southern make any sense not no

437
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,220
very random or spear %um should
first-order

438
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:25,940
of such missed a table and remember that
information send the packet along to the

439
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,080
mojos with census in an hour

440
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,330
now in in the acknowledgement number

441
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,649
arm then I subtract the of stuff on
there

442
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,050
acknowledgement number be 4i send it
back to the poon also took on a wall the

443
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,590
often

444
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:44,780
use no sodas is situation with the state
tables really be

445
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,730
use advantage the sequence number thing
is

446
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,910
some stuff in the ER complicated issued
a

447
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,300
has to be handle so we have

448
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,240
other OS scanners there you know need to
be four

449
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,760
the water for more to be more complete
but school

450
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,030
one of those is the passive loss
finger-pointing

451
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,220
I figure it out in order to for doubt

452
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,200
mean there's really no mom captive
solicitation

453
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,440
by the passable ass finger pointing
toward so what I need to do is be

454
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,190
really good about things like sequence
number generation and making sure I'm

455
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,680
consistent with what I say I am in

456
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,050
as long as I'm doing stuff like that out
and also timing analysis

457
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,139
if I'm doing all those scenes corruptly

458
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,890
then are passable as fingerprinting
should be

459
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:44,780
now the packet timing analysis

460
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:50,680
re bass another issue that I'm going to
have to use the state table

461
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,900
for I'm going to have to know okay since
I'm

462
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,670
emulating miss all last in another
really talked about Halloween

463
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:04,170
works firings or Sun a simple app it in
then when I so no sir now

464
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:09,490
we'll take that happens too often so
after a set amount of time

465
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,460
according to what a loss I am all son
another one another Sina

466
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,440
because I'd don't think they ever got it
in there to opt out to

467
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,670
in this just keep doing now no calculate
the tiny

468
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,700
difference between those our subsequent
happier

469
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,840
in and figure out what unless you are
based on now

470
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,350
because you know I love you know a
thousand different so in that case what

471
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,640
I'm going to need to do is I'm going to
need

472
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,100
for survive no what I'm emulating and I
know what the expected time

473
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,760
deploys for happy retransmission what
I'm

474
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,280
emulate solo self-doubt this amount of
time

475
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,080
and ice una cena in

476
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,190
they drop it and I never hear anything
back so after

477
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,600
the somalia time my son another so now

478
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,310
according to what I want to emulate but
in the case of if about time passes

479
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,389
be 4i you know wanna send another packet

480
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,719
then I have to make your that is double

481
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,909
the original time that I was going to
meet

482
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:21,460
transmit Indus going to be useful to
have a state table

483
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,340
do there's a tool calls

484
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,510
nap time that I didn't really look at a
lot

485
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,860
but they sat on their site the what they
were doing was

486
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,230
since ring was proof of concept in North
number release

487
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,620
they're going to take the techniques
farming

488
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,060
that was discussed in the white paper in
there are going to add in some other

489
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,929
passive

490
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:48,270
OS finger pointing to meese and put
together snap times

491
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:55,270
so us one other tools that I want to
take a look at more

492
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,240
there was a talk at cancer loss earlier
this year

493
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,970
I think it was people and I don't know
how many people here

494
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,339
cancer class up

495
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:15,308
I you on those atop on new OS
fingerprinting techniques

496
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:19,150
so I think this guy works for Anna far
in

497
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,420
arm develop some new techniques for what

498
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,609
currently existing a lot of what he's
doing

499
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:31,290
is some absolutely expanding on timing
analysis

500
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,960
he'd also seen various creative ways for
example

501
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,680
no use layer 7 information two-time
analysis

502
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,020
for example hole Sun a TTP

503
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,250
yet happy over to the mojos

504
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:50,540
& the mojos cool on 18

505
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,180
spahn and um

506
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,040
no look at that no profit and then

507
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,049
after certain amount of time post
restraint

508
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:05,799
that path again and he'll take all those
timing differences

509
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:11,809
up this is still us because this is how
they deal with application lovell

510
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:15,049
restraint which apparently

511
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:18,829
different I'm them like regular TC

512
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:23,839
like so that's very interesting

513
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,960
and he expands on the timing analysis
sold out

514
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,430
stuttered just dropping a synapse Intel

515
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,808
relating how much time it takes for
another one held slop other types of her

516
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:38,790
and see how long it takes you know

517
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:45,680
respond again without one no also to
things like measure the window behavior

518
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,680
so you've got your you know your son

519
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,049
offer in Hill look at that no wholesale

520
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:58,759
peso you got your son buffer you're
standing me this information

521
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,520
while I'm just not you know going to

522
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,520
tell you that I've got this information
and you're gonna time send it again

523
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,299
in after a while I'll take the timing
differences between those in helping

524
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:12,390
colliculus

525
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:18,049
soul in yes she had like 37 testes

526
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:22,599
think about this a map at like nine soul

527
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,930
I think I'm going to be spending a lot
of time looking ahead to

528
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:32,509
cases see what I can do about that

529
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,980
okay so we set out there we talked about
all these

530
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,350
alas finger-pointing at me those

531
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:43,790
bad thing now implementation lucky you
really do

532
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,990
to avoid being fingerprinted while

533
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,350
like a subtle yours not really vendors
fault entirely there are really

534
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:53,110
legitimate gray areas

535
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:57,770
im staff implementation so

536
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:02,390
arm maybe what we need to do is have
another RFC

537
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:07,210
words to find more clearly is sappy what
kind of behavior we should I stop

538
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,560
under certain conditions so that
everyone can follow the same

539
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,799
specifications

540
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,810
now

541
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,360
another thing that you can do is if you
really paranoid

542
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,590
you can take your server in you can

543
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,760
make that a proxy in unlike you can have
your

544
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,200
high-value target behind in Seoul

545
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,780
your posse all those post behind so

546
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,460
if someone tied to stand on the number
figure out what they are

547
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,440
they only know what your party post is
but if you really paranoid

548
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,570
you can't do something like this store
more on your party holds and don't worry

549
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,960
about the high-value targets your party

550
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,740
obviously hardened them into all those
for additional security

551
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,240
things more for its just a layer by the
way is not going to

552
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,900
save you from everything and then

553
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,450
by doing there you know you can't just
avoid

554
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:12,430
having people think well us now

555
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:16,109
there are a lot of challenges defeating
horse finger-pointing

556
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:20,660
and I think it's important to share that
out first of all

557
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,620
if you're going to be advertising a
different window sizes and what you

558
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,700
underlying OS is supporting

559
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,380
very careful about that for example

560
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,540
Linux arm the window sizes no

561
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,070
5.7 K bytes when does a site 60/40

562
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:43,730
so if you tell somebody you underline OS
is Linux

563
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:48,240
and you're trying to emulate Windows
2000 you tell somebody

564
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:55,190
all my window size a 60-45 gonna push
back 6045 softie

565
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,950
you gonna go way my underlying OS is use

566
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,200
because not you know it's not ready

567
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,680
so are you gonna do and what I've done

568
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,020
is I'm going to last

569
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,240
save that information in the state table
by so they put me 64

570
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,740
he bites with a star in Icesave that
information

571
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,090
state table and then I pushed of that
information of the state able to the

572
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:22,770
online

573
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,020
alas at a rate batters comparable with

574
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:31,540
so does not we use now arm

575
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,580
I'm one into this all year but having
the distinguished between normal and

576
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,100
abnormal connections

577
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,210
using a state able to figure well all

578
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:46,810
well someone's a sudden you're so now
was that because I just sent them a sin

579
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,340
or did they just on your so now without
any solicitation fun

580
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,490
and I would use a state table

581
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:57,810
to figure that out read of the state
table and

582
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,140
if there's no arms internationals

583
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,720
reported the road I'll be like oh this
is a legitimate I'll just have these

584
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,050
are the inbound hander respond to upbeat
now even with all the challenges

585
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,310
even if I do more you know completely
equal roughly

586
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,930
in a works perfectly the problem is

587
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:24,520
if someone wants and now against me la
teleport I have opened and my underlying

588
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,460
OS is Windows 2000 and I'm sane i'm open
DSP and they stayed

589
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,030
know they see that I help 137 139 up I
also open

590
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:38,230
up in a war so this

591
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,620
OS been appointing arm defeating happy
isn't going to help against a

592
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,980
what it is useful for though is for the
casual

593
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,950
skin let's say somebody you know is
standing a large block

594
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:54,960
I P and just want to see what post out
there

595
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,130
are running Windows so that they can
target more

596
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,310
later so in that case they would do the
scan no sale

597
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,080
home wall these hosts a the window signs
a sin to focus on these

598
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,529
IP's in that case I would help you

599
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,440
but they're not looking for you as a
target to a

600
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,280
arm also

601
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,980
there are some automated attack like to
name the warm

602
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,730
they don't hear well OSU running no they
don't go and knock on every single door

603
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:32,080
end of up to morph isn't going to be a
little help now situation either

604
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,190
you underline your sins window what's
you know

605
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:41,580
name doesn't care what you say

606
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,450
alright there's a lot of work that I
have to do for more

607
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:49,680
still and one of those is that I'd like
to support more

608
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,589
and relational OS's for example would be
cool to be able to emulate

609
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,030
limits sole heiress all these other OS's

610
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,790
I am also it would be really great to be
able to get more

611
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:08,340
to install our windows because I figured
that most people would be using tools

612
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,160
like this to be

613
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,730
running Windows

614
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:16,940
now arm also the timing analysis and the
passive

615
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,400
OS fingerprinting tools would be really
nice to be able to afford

616
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,460
dole's as well I'll be working on a

617
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,770
now eventually

618
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:31,700
farther down the line when I have more
as a much better package

619
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,340
there's poly more that I wanna implement
and that's going to look more

620
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,200
into cooling applications not
necessarily

621
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,330
closing the ports for those application

622
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:48,590
messing around with them layer 7 mission
so that the application standard for no

623
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,950
necessarily what's funny and of course
everyone logically

624
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,260
on Sina put in Italy support more OB
pretty easy compared to the

625
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,850
the other stuff that

626
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,049
near some people will help me I'll I
really appreciate it

627
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,940
either by riding you know library that I
can bill more fun

628
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,720
or by you must live or

629
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,720
suggestions for the slides any questions
yeah

630
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:29,140
the question was why is it important
only other

631
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,140
operating systems is that it's just math
in your home

632
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:39,140
well you're kinda masking your own
operating system with more

633
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:51,500
I'll

634
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:58,500
I am

635
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:06,880
client like I mentioned a few other
casual attacker who's doing the Mastan

636
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,120
on a block of my pieces see how many
Windows

637
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,620
machines there are out there this is
where can really help

638
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,700
use more now if you do something like

639
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,820
you wanna tell them what you are at all
you want to give them any information

640
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:27,820
they might get curious in target morning
lolol wow this is a puzzle here

641
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,820
well I think most sought-after right now
focus on Windows

642
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,710
not OpenBSD so you

643
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:53,710
okay

644
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,400
while arm I think that if you're very
targeted

645
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,280
as you know someone already knows that
they wanna

646
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,380
to nor machine I don't they more can
help communities

647
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,440
so it doesn't even matter that they just
wanted to a poor CNN

648
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,740
no see what applications are running
because if they get to that point burn

649
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:41,040
I don't think more can help you

650
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,630
are more pricier does kinda another
layer of security that you can think

651
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,670
about using

652
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,290
as not not by any means

653
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:56,740
a solution the solution I had a lot of
fun working on this I think this is a

654
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:01,910
really fun research project well

655
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:05,970
I wanted to do something you know
contribute to the community

656
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:12,970
and I thought that this would be a legal
way to do it

657
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,410
able to

658
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:35,589
maybe emulate like other post arm

659
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,880
have you looked too honey D year okay it
seems like it's

660
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,730
a little similar life this is they arm

661
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,120
thus completely takes over your house

662
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,520
in honey D is hun over South up

663
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:56,140
many virtual machines on your host so
your house is still

664
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,140
Friedel apply as it wishes

665
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,029
far more fit the complete takeover holes

666
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:10,030
so yeah

667
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,460
to to understand it correctly that more
is only

668
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,680
responding to active probes it's not
scrubbing

669
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,370
like all traffic it's coming through
it's waiting to see annex program map

670
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:29,650
packet for scrubs traffic so you're
asking a far more Phys

671
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,690
a battle against at school

672
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,640
know is it scrubbing all traffic that at
Caesars only scrubbing traffic

673
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,790
when it sees and map pro x-pro

674
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:43,200
always stopping traffic

675
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,880
for every single pack it up comes into
their homes

676
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,370
it doesn't have to be relevant to our
scanner at all

677
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:54,150
okay yeah a completely takes over the
host in

678
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,470
arm more for comp we use

679
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,830
on according to what only OSU wanna be

680
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:03,890
are X so can be a regular traffic

681
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:10,680
happen an ass to you know what I shoulda
done mode is a

682
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,279
associates connection into this post

683
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,350
while more is one but that'll work too
such as one nation without work

684
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:23,190
because that means that you can still
too regular and options in

685
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,630
sup over there
