1
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:05,379
this is the first session Nov hope 5 we
have David Bernick areas

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:12,379
she my apologies

3
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,698
for me cool it's like being obnoxious

4
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:23,130
alright well without further I

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,529
um don't speak distributed password
cracking and

6
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:29,890
a go through this trip after cracking
toward the middle to the end

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,840
in be showing several API's including
what I wrote to be putting on

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,360
SourceForge right after the talk

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,769
and but on top of that I'm talk but
general kinda cracking in general when

10
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,900
you can really move from

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,550
thing it on a single computer to bring
huge amount

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,200
years behind because a lot of things I
see when I work are people tried to

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,460
distribute password cracking

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,610
things that are unnecessary and vice
versa so

15
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,860
okay so I used to write for 2500
occasionally

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,620
rely on our cause got social engineering
the kinda lame

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,640
I did a long time ago I was much younger
and a lot more here than I don't anymore

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,829
a big thing bit better but since we
started texting

19
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,859
if you live in Boston should you know
gonna hang out caseworkers Slashdot

20
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:17,140
NBA Linex and I than distribute
computing for Pixar

21
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,210
the computer for Google stuff like that
so

22
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,719
then distribute money meetings with him
about ok really working for a company

23
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,079
called

24
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,149
legal computer solutions up in Boston
legal computer solutions we handle very

25
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:30,359
large core cases

26
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,530
criminal cases a civil cases involve
huge about

27
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,659
documents millions to billions of pages
per case

28
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,740
so we get 'em hard drive DVD whatever

29
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,030
me miss tort system in secure them and

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,159
the evidence comes in ton different
forms for the electronic these days so

31
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,329
emails PST files do you see piles and
piles

32
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:54,479
tips just thumb drives hard drives

33
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,679
everything ok kinda thing but sometimes
these passwords are

34
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:01,270
so that the files are password-protected
or a cryptid

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,109
and if there's a legal order to do so
and sometimes when there's not

36
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,950
in tell you why not sometimes we do in
fact cracked the files that we can

37
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:14,890
I'm usually weekend you know why

38
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,099
cracked legally or illegally for that
matter

39
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:22,790
well a if the defense says well you we
haven't succeeded to go to you and

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,099
in our prosecution we were per se well
we need it now

41
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,379
and we are really changing that it would

42
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:32,399
opening it very differently that's how
we say so

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,739
we just have to crack it sometimes even
though maybe some issues with crack

44
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,079
and sometimes the original owner is dead

45
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:43,150
or can be found or is on the run or
whatever the case may be

46
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,409
we just have to open this stuff there's
no password

47
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:51,989
available it depends on the actual issue
sometimes

48
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,620
they said the legality a password
cracking is really weird

49
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,670
because we're not actually altering any
the data

50
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,739
visits with take a forensic image ovett
so we're just offering our friends image

51
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:03,519
of the data

52
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,409
and personally I'm it licensed private
investigator so

53
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:10,569
under the purview the court I'm easy
just allowed to investigate as they see

54
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:10,980
fit

55
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,950
for the for the issue because all the
stuff we have

56
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,700
we got through our Lord anyhow so we
have it legally

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,030
the question is can the crack it answers
we are you got it legally so

58
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,709
usually yes sometimes no

59
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,799
usually weekend unit sometimes no

60
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,200
we can be kinda purged for me I'm

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,319
answer mostly be crack a lotta mix of
the office files

62
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,379
in excess of office father interesting

63
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:42,480
because the encryption is week it's a
forty bit

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,590
encryption to do export reasons a but
that still out there super super weak

65
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,140
you can't really cracked on the computer
in a reasonable amount of time

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,159
but we're going with attorneys you're
doing with criminals

67
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,450
for the most part both are very stupid
especially attorney surprisingly

68
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,659
indeed you do three to five characters
per password so

69
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,260
you can practically computer a simple
poor thing which

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,030
that will be used to do for Microsoft
Office if in case it's a hugely long

71
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,819
password

72
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:14,010
what will end up doing instead is just
doing searching in Turkey space which is

73
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,900
only forty bit

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,459
and we string it together about five or
six computers and

75
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:23,650
gets done 20 minutes we take a guess at

76
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,000
first thing we do is you run it a brute
force against between

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,370
225 character to the six characters
because

78
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,419
that takes on even a condom on a pimp or
take them

79
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,198
three minutes so it's worth trying just
to see if it's shorter

80
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,889
yeah exact if it's more than six
characters I consider it long

81
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,810
and I get to why that the weather is in
the second the files also have a fairly

82
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,090
interestingly we

83
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,380
problematic fiction if you have one at
the files that you know is in the

84
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,590
archive

85
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,880
you have it on a cryptid usually search
the key space based on that

86
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,300
unencrypted file pretty quickly matter
couple hours

87
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,720
three hours or so but not that they said
it was

88
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,880
better to start reporting it with three
to five characters much beyond that

89
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,979
think there's other ways around it a PDF
files pretty much the same thing with

90
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,400
alcance of software

91
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,880
which we use a lot for smaller kinda

92
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,880
corruptions a there's that work great

93
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,009
into the legalities in this country are
AP it does really

94
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:28,440
work use it we r alcance of the company
outta Russia

95
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,039
EL COM as

96
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,349
they make are in for the coke wrapping
crack software that is

97
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:39,639
fairly cheap you should buy get it up

98
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,639
Michael and it is

99
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,599
the israeli eighty dollars really quite
good incident at the crack web sites

100
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,460
that we got a lot of

101
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,020
for RB of we develop a rugby

102
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,159
and sometimes some the state's own I'd

103
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,990
the case may be isn't for investigation
Becky detected

104
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,430
straight up order do so and for school

105
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,669
password for me

106
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,400
people um so when it when we try to

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,879
crack vials personally do with the with
the Canary tech we have a nice big sixty

108
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,199
megabyte or so

109
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,190
filed for some you have bigger one about
it later really care

110
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,229
it's good enough we do some munching
stuff to the end up in

111
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,628
to sum up in cap make space fairly small

112
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:30,720
it's really bad first thing you do their
own text couple minutes modern machine

113
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,310
and with a single machine at that's
great

114
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,620
I the next we do is we try to attack

115
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,910
protect the the corruption itself which

116
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,150
is for the most part pretty talking
about people who really care

117
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,830
once again in in the work we do most
black you don't care

118
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,508
in the mic put a password a file they
have no idea what that really does

119
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:56,909
unaware that their truly affected and
with under six characters

120
00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:01,110
just reported bathroom on a machine but
it's bigger than 8 characters be

121
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,169
we try to consider running across a
distributed network

122
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:07,840
if it's possible so the different kinds
of distributing there's

123
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,220
big ass our machines son has 24
processors and

124
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,680
giant back you know joint many cabinet
box in its

125
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,069
very very very very expensive but
they're really fast

126
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,270
um commodity clusters and that's just

127
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,750
you go and buy 20 machines that are
identical string together Gigabit

128
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,580
and say okay here's my the computer and
you run and MPI cutting across it

129
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,669
which will get into later which kinda
strings them all together

130
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:36,229
in some mechanism but then there's a
heterogeneous distributed clusters which

131
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,349
is what we're all kinda familiar with
with

132
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,490
distributed dotnet city at home

133
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,699
and you in your friends computers you
kinda

134
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,990
may be linked together in some mechanism
or in our case our office we have our

135
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,729
big commodity cluster but we also have
all the desktops that are all over the

136
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,479
place in people's Palm Pilot

137
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,840
anything that we can squeeze CPU been
without

138
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,139
and so do and there already from

139
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,750
anything has a network can be part of a
a large cluster

140
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,580
so the heterogenous this year because
the network hardware

141
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,460
doesn't matter what kinda OS you don't
know how long it on the network in a

142
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,229
normal

143
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,800
the of the network you don't know that
Gigabit Ethernet near net

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,050
in a band whatever the case may be as
long as its peak TCPIP

145
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,750
it's great problems are exactly those
can

146
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,699
assume always that you know what the
computer is that you're dealing with

147
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,930
you just assume that it can run TTP AP

148
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,640
and maybe can run the program that you
can pile to that that's the problem

149
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,779
the biggest problem we seize message
latency and let you dealing with the

150
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,890
a interconnect Inc near net or in a band
the latency period in between packets is

151
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,839
incredibly slow

152
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,850
anything could give it as being best but
it just isn't

153
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,260
was under the space in between
individual packets to take a long time

154
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,110
wouldn't talk to each other and
differences in process Peter

155
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,390
are an issue we deal with this kinda
stuff because

156
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,410
you know if you say this task is gay big

157
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,680
and all the same size task some of them
just can't deal with it

158
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,440
somebody with the two quickly so you end
up having our computers waiting lot

159
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,209
Peters not waiting it evolved in doing
work all the time

160
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:17,310
so you only wanna do with watermarking
supercomputing

161
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,660
to keep the level to keep all the meters
working all the time no matter what

162
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,990
be there how best they are and

163
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,040
in the other issue is up time love each
machine some machines on the network for

164
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,779
twenty-minute summer machine on their
per hour some need to have other work

165
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,470
done to him

166
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,579
go back and forth you really have to

167
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:42,160
rate your API to to deal with that

168
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,430
so yet distributed heterogeneous
products city at home

169
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,690
distribute dotnet in the kinda graphic
rendering that we did a Pixar

170
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,380
where we have our big computers but then
I'll time on people's personal desktop

171
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,899
also into it doing the things that seiz

172
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,940
HP orders were to computers or doing the
same stuff

173
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,579
so that the the

174
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:07,690
doctor reporting stuff so there's
different ways you can prove

175
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,870
force a password a.m. one is to use it
other than the figures out what the

176
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,070
notable ish words are and only run them
against it

177
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,260
as opposed to an all possible
combinations which that singer

178
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,800
your he sighs quite a bit most the

179
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,670
stuff that we see are protected by only
their case in uppercase and numbers only

180
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,139
on the up in america character no
special characters we don't usually run

181
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,889
again special characters just simply
because

182
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,720
the possibilities in our work they're
being special characters

183
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,050
some past balsam lawyer did is virtually
none

184
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,170
most are some business lower case so
we'll just try that and

185
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,510
searching in eight to 10 character keys
bass over there were cases

186
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,209
is fairly fast and

187
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,980
it so that the you have six character
alphanumeric password on the pending for

188
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,209
it takes about 12 hours again says it by
Laura or local crips

189
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:04,100
file per password and it hurt to pass
all the sudden jumps about 2,500 37 days

190
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,540
and that's assuming that the mission is
complete dedicated that s

191
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,719
so you see the problem that we have is
that once it gets to that point it out

192
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,870
said

193
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,190
much harder issue crack something stupid
stuff

194
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,410
yeah yeah that's machine

195
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,319
so the different ways to do this to be
cracking a.m. you can cut a search space

196
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,209
into different parts

197
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:28,510
have each cracker be independent there's
distribute John the Ripper thing called

198
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,139
the John that's out there

199
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,160
and D John is interesting that basically
what you do is you take

200
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,209
each instance John the Ripper you put it
on

201
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,690
45 yr blah blah blah different Amanda
machines any say

202
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,149
dismissed the first one goes through a
to be the person necklace

203
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,769
CD is given at the many keys bass the
search

204
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:50,450
you say ago and would have one comes
back with it comes back with it

205
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,250
that's it this is kinda inefficient

206
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,850
said you have to know exactly what
machine to dealing with if the only

207
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,589
machine yourself

208
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:02,199
you have to know when you're not using
them when you can because it someone

209
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,310
stops well as prices in the middle on
that your password is

210
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:09,010
its last unified but on this trip to
John the Ripper is a

211
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,870
Goodwillie to do stuff like where
cracking

212
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,550
and other kinds a reportedly may come up
against

213
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,079
you can use a queuing system like a
network render what you do there is a

214
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,790
need to have a large task space

215
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,939
that such as frames and animation and

216
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,810
each one is fairly large you're just
grabs one works on it when it's done

217
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,079
with the back into it on the tele
communication between clients and

218
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,010
servers they just making when they're
done

219
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,120
only when they're done so you can really
understand if things have aborted

220
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,029
the transactional locking nothing like
that but

221
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:47,680
but it does it does in fact working at
the systems are what's up

222
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,160
the without the different ones being a
whats up are using but there's

223
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,850
cue systems like is 18 new genera
queuing for

224
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,199
use any kind in the wake you up
wetherbee best scripts or

225
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,370
or what everyone in that it's actually
really cool for Patrick racking

226
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,940
and its a PBS and there's an open one
open PBS

227
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,579
p as in p B&B s as in

228
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:14,639
yes PBS with a

229
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,130
oh okay yet the ice how the spill PBS

230
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,899
PBS a

231
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:27,449
portable bats scheduler and but

232
00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:30,959
yes they'll be am p

233
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,709
and B&S course that

234
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,810
um it actually is it's very cool tool
that hackers to get used to

235
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,329
it's officially open source with not GPO
it to fill out some registration form to

236
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:43,190
get it

237
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,880
a in when you get the open version there
is no docs for so

238
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,540
it's fun a in that really awful way

239
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,610
but if you wanna paying them seem any
money you can get the

240
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,350
in an open PBS version you know do that
way

241
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,889
but who was that a initially coaxing to
say that

242
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,990
you know look I have a billion a crack
scripts on a billing machines and I was

243
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,380
gonna

244
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,949
Humala Pinterest do it that way a in the
other

245
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:12,930
waited to do this should be cracking is
a using a tuple based messaging system

246
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,480
like MPI our job base 30 spaces is what
I'll be

247
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,060
mostly talking about MPI is a is a

248
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,120
very robust system for passing messages
between

249
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,329
clients and servers into the we
differentiate between the two in it

250
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,459
useful for communication between
processes it's kinda nigga

251
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:34,910
builds upon it builds against RP RBC
kinda things

252
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,230
and remote method invocation disturbing
object across networks and having them

253
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,240
talk to each other

254
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,480
the tuples our message Bay system a.m.
this the have a poor tasks

255
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,610
in each waiting computer takes one it
communicates

256
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,620
fairly consistently back to the server
telling you what kinda prostitutes on

257
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,019
with the

258
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,089
if it fails that it says okay put it
back in the pool ideal transactions

259
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,910
dominant takes advantage it takes
different vendors between two computers

260
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,100
different networks but it says OK this
guy's a slower this goes a little faster

261
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,449
with given this chunk

262
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,759
in this show anything kinda me deeply
that

263
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:15,540
be a thing MPI jobs basis

264
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,430
um the client only talk to the to the
with depends which

265
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,839
which system talking about depends how
you have how you have a coordinated for

266
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,589
the most part

267
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,910
since I can work on a closed network I
just have a machine being a task manager

268
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,339
kinda

269
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:32,050
and he did distribute the test computers
so he can maintain

270
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,980
which guys busy which guys not busy you
can have the kinds I'll be

271
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,560
a complete the heterogeneous and not
understand who is a server to the client

272
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,709
just the task for from the cat file
server

273
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,940
in their underwear because other and
that those in fact work pretty well

274
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,550
a

275
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,450
they don't communicate with her if you
don't want them to you need to have a

276
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,770
central place to get results

277
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,949
think that in his 10 check each client
individually

278
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,750
yet they don't communicate with anything
other than a the initial

279
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:06,679
task list which they can get need stingy
never again

280
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,249
so well

281
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:11,429
that awesome QuickTime minted investor

282
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,339
well it's a cool picture about the
prospects for it's really me

283
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:19,049
a it's amazing you've never seen
anything like it

284
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,869
its know ugh basically that the picture
is a

285
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:27,219
you have several little client think
introduce interpretive dance

286
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:31,759
um yes every little client things right
now the separate little client things

287
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,119
take a entry from the central space
whether it's on a machine

288
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:39,599
or they get it when instantiated
initially and then they

289
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:43,229
process and then they put it that and
they don't have to talk to each other in

290
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:44,069
a can

291
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:48,109
have to that way message passing is a
really cool technology

292
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:52,489
so MPI is the most prominent message
passing

293
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:55,719
interface which is why it's called MPI
and its im p

294
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:59,749
um MPI is seabass

295
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:02,879
API I didn't see first bus interface
court to

296
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,720
it CB its really robust fairly portable

297
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,309
if you're willing to put the libraries
it requires and all the other things

298
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:11,878
requires on each machine

299
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:14,870
does in fact work on Windows

300
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,260
it sorta works on Mac OS X

301
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,950
kinda enough it to add Apple has their
own version of it they've been releasing

302
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,680
for doing their big EXR distributing the

303
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,690
right on top of the MPI interface kinda
work um

304
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,480
it's not very user-friendly and there's
a lot of documentation out there about

305
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,210
it but it's

306
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,660
really choirs quite a bit knowledge not
receive it network in general

307
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,370
and its very ugly looking wanted sort
happening even if you think you're a

308
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,120
pretty good

309
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,930
just not look good it got very a few
heavy overhead when it comes to the

310
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,850
network itself

311
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,919
it does pass a lot of messages and each
one of them is

312
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,940
quite substantially large and it ends up
being attachment to your program

313
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,370
when you start dealing with heavy heavy
overhead in your thing about your

314
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,550
network is being the bottleneck but it
ends up being

315
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,409
the bottleneck if not passing real data
through it it just ends up being very

316
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,020
slow

317
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:13,010
because the leniency it doesn't force
you to be have a lot of structure and is

318
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,300
better than a pretty code

319
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,850
you can kinda rate hey everyone enable
kinda still work what's great about it

320
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,570
really really really fast in its really
robust in its been used for

321
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,470
ten years or more people have all over
the place and it works real

322
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,730
T spaces is jobbers

323
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,920
a IBM's Java Grid project and

324
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,330
just released an open source pretty
recently in its honor winners would I be

325
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,149
any licenses

326
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,340
a.m. IBM funds it which makes it you
know it it's progressing

327
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,560
for the best because IBM is is its
funding it but

328
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,000
unfortunately it's not

329
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,360
it's not completely open and beyond that

330
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,360
its really easy to use it in style about
the job

331
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,360
I don't jobs base is what I

332
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,440
rate in double spaces uses Java it's
really portable as long as the machine

333
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,030
has a JVM 1.2

334
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,770
JVM on it and it can run its client or
server doesn't really matter where you

335
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,110
go to put it a

336
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,420
using J&R you can tie and whatever
existing C++ code you have that you use

337
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,520
for cracking into it

338
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,320
and supports transactions which is a
really really cool feature

339
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,350
for supercomputing distributed computing
is bitch the you

340
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,900
hypothetically takeover computer use it
as a zombie because

341
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,510
if the process to doing fails

342
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,760
to put it back into the queue for the
computers to get so that way

343
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,860
if you're your stuff is at the neck the
space that its

344
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,380
that the their computer searching on get
it back aching

345
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,120
continue to work on it the job spaces
API

346
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:49,050
is fairly simple you just need to two
objects need a test entry

347
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,220
and that's the actual thing that gets
omitted and contains the code

348
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,720
that does the actual cracking which are
show in a minute such as your

349
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,530
crypt routine or your report against the
website routine or whatever the case may

350
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:02,950
be

351
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,320
and then near the entry which is the
result

352
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,990
and that's all you need the interest up
is really generic in

353
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,790
you just great one 10 line thing for
your entry in that that the test country

354
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,340
can get

355
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,649
fairly large but even so all has to
contain as a single method in that

356
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,320
method you had

357
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,179
you're cracking routine and that's all
you need and everything else is pretty

358
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,430
much taken care of by the

359
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,770
yeah I so here's one at me here's what
my

360
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,550
execute methods is the method that you
need in this test Entry space

361
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,690
returns entry and this is for cracking a
website so first thing it does is a

362
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,010
says the the for loop involves

363
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,560
the number times each test is gonna try
things when the interesting things about

364
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,490
supercomputing

365
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,340
is that you don't want each worker to
destroy things one single back want to

366
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:51,689
try

367
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,890
large subset but not too large to
overwhelm it large enough

368
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,450
that is not spending a lot of time
talking back to the server to get more

369
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:58,980
test

370
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,210
that you want to take a large subset 24
crack your website it say each worker

371
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,380
takes a hundred thousand

372
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,000
to 2000 passwords to try so you know for
one

373
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,030
for your tooth 2060 think this says

374
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,389
and get the URL its connection to the
URL

375
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,900
uses a the opposition normal basic
authorization

376
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,870
username and password a send and then

377
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,070
the resort it sees it it the result is
valid

378
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,340
and if not it

379
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,050
tries another work do that and then
would exhaust its entire space

380
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,780
it just goes and gets another 20,000
passwords to try or whatever

381
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,410
the kid so that's all you really need to
do to make a.m.

382
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,930
the API work for any kinda cracking the
one to do the textbook forcing

383
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,960
and it's more than just password do any
test the need to do about

384
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,830
a bit in due to a computer you can do
the cool thing about that is that

385
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,840
when you tack with jobs bases if you're
going to attack a machine

386
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,860
using a distributed attack a.m.

387
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,110
all you need is a said its GBM on that
other machine and that will be a worker

388
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,840
and it's only has access to the server
its gonna test this from Melissa get

389
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,810
them

390
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:13,720
substantiation you can you can

391
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,780
just where you are you can get part it s
to

392
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,700
you hypothetically took over 2,000
sheen's those copy part every little

393
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,860
anything using when everyone

394
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,730
if no one notices you so the government
jobs base's claim payload

395
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,770
instead of having a DDoS zombie a you
could set up a large distributed

396
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,639
supercomputer to crack passwords to
attack website to do whatever it is it's

397
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,140
a lot more

398
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,450
interesting attack dangers have in fact
been that simple

399
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,660
DDoS on the client is pretty small

400
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,060
as long as the mission has Java said the
client is

401
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,139
10 10 K

402
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,810
smaller Fort Lee it is traceable on the
behest

403
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,669
communicate back to the server if you've
written your program that way you can

404
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:58,960
see

405
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,110
going back to the server line and that
obviously untraceable

406
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,270
let the course you you're making a WiFi
network somewhere hidden

407
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,170
that the embossing walk away from it

408
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,510
and use a disposable cartridge p for
cash

409
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,220
at a if you did that it would not be as
traceable they'd find it eventually but

410
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,630
haha

411
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,950
your drinking cup in the sink hope that

412
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,010
currently coffees me

413
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,360
um any people tasked me distribute any
kinda

414
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,820
distribute system job spaces be MPI

415
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,290
or be it whatever kinda attack

416
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,540
you can think I did pass for cracking
because that's what we do

417
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,659
I would a wrapper around the job spaces
think on burn spaces right now

418
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,470
by change it to something stupid but its
burn spaces right now that makes it

419
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,270
really easy

420
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,389
free just two use an XML file to
configure

421
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,560
whatever attack you want to do summit
that's it that is gonna go on

422
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,000
SourceForge later today to you have to
really know the job to get it working

423
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,410
it is that the new XML to builder
certain kind of external schema

424
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,270
for its use to attack whatever thinking
to attack

425
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,780
and but if anything you can think of to
be forced to should be competing does

426
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,370
work was clients a very small she can
put them on

427
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,750
any computer you have lying around your
house or someone else's house

428
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,860
that matter I did put jobs bases on a
Palm Pilot

429
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,510
my home phone in this thing cracks about

430
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:27,040
five in sec the that's what effect which
is nothing

431
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,379
but still kinda cool it works so

432
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,130
your some resources if I can't see them
but there are some resources

433
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,490
the you know if anyone has any questions
I will answer questions

434
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:45,490
you know

435
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,250
this is world the law enforcement
officers go fresh P

436
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,280
okay I've question you were talking
about

437
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,280
other forms of distributed computing
that's our thing

438
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,090
arm I am I I was playing

439
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,480
all the while ago with open mosaics

440
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,380
and the mosaics auto discovery Damon
cool they bring that up yeah

441
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,550
yet and there's actually on not fix

442
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,180
St a live CD disability please

443
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,830
at STD okay everyone its its

444
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,129
it's very hard ass he pacts

445
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:48,840
no are its STD as security tools
distribution

446
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,600
not as in what anyway on

447
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,630
yeah and there's actually this 12 on
their cult Cecilia

448
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:04,480
which is for cracking Windows you know
Sam passwords for NT 2000 that something

449
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,300
and its designed to figure out

450
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,490
if you are on mosaics cluster at which
point

451
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,510
it will figure out how many notes are on
the cluster

452
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,190
and we'll fork that many times and each

453
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,850
process goes you each node it's actually
quite neat so

454
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:29,570
that but that would work wouldn't using
the techniques you describe your mosaics

455
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,439
Moses excuses with you brought up most
it's an open mosaics which are

456
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,770
different but the sale promos expert
thats purposes

457
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,150
is a really cool project for
distributing any kinda

458
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:44,280
test that threaded against to multiple
computers

459
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,330
not easily manageable the threads
unfortunately

460
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,919
so the transaction kinda things aren't
aren't really there if that requires on

461
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,040
in other words it you put Okemos its on
machines that aren't yours

462
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,720
hypothetically

463
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,310
in that means but legally illegally
stuff that he put machines stuff against

464
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,760
machines

465
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,840
are yours you can't really control

466
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,630
so much for the doing up in those
excesses spread the threads as much as

467
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,570
humanly possible

468
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,340
and you can only control wishing to go
to once they started

469
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,270
so good for the large taft's going to
each machine

470
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,690
you just have to hope they get it done
right if they don't

471
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,330
kinda screwed but in general a gift you
really care about the transaction kinda

472
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,800
element ovett up emergency is every
legal solution for doing all different

473
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,750
sorts of things there

474
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,920
thread unit the other problem is cars
the greater the code to be

475
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,110
to know POSIX threads really well
because the or find a lot of weird

476
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,310
problems that people player writing
metzger the cup in with your with your

477
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,169
thread routines hey

478
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:47,350
Nuggets about if you not them

479
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,700
right of a lot in your a member

480
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,930
up any other type

481
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,100
password passes that'd be

482
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,360
hashers like pastoral something else

483
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,690
like strings characters

484
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:16,540
I mean if you wanna cracker password you
had your character set however long it

485
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,510
is whatever it is

486
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,950
and you can iterate through every
possibility character set

487
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,650
or can generate your own dictionary if
you can do a dictionary attack

488
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,150
or small area brute force attack against
six characters or less

489
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,570
he's one computers you don't worry about
any kind distributed anything

490
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,620
for a passer

491
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,460
as 18 characters more than rate King can
you actually

492
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,050
distribute and make a huge database

493
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,940
well can you and repeat the question re:

494
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,210
for example this have a character 18

495
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,790
passers eating character rain any to
have

496
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:57,409
dictionary gonna make dictionary this
from possible possible

497
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:01,200
18 character passwords and I wanna
distributed all those

498
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,570
within the network okay yeah I mean yeah
absolutely can distribute dictionary

499
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,260
cross at the

500
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,790
that that size in the dictionary attack
absolutely saying the same way you do

501
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,270
that you would

502
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,290
UTEP the dictionary that large task into
the first hundred thousand words here

503
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,310
the next two thousand is your week

504
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,870
relatedly you had for one machine on

505
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:27,130
regular force it was like 200 okay with
it yet we do is say how long

506
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,320
is the key space you you're dealing with
we need the space

507
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,169
this a space matter you know have like
five gig database of passers

508
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:41,500
right in a distributed within you know
twenty twenty-some machines

509
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,530
this is really matter really there

510
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,970
no the not really

511
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,860
the you manage that what mission get
what pieces and you need to test it is

512
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,100
there a cochlear

513
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,160
wreck for some yeah okay here's that the
matter

514
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,680
exponential map its basically you take

515
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,310
how many possible characters are dealing
with

516
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:08,850
okay and the exponent is how many
characters you

517
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,000
so the FT said to be 95 to

518
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,310
18 our anything and that's how many

519
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:19,600
permutations has did through it all the
way which is be huge

520
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,270
yeah you don't want to do that that's it
really that

521
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:28,800
low I am fairly new to distributed
computing

522
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,800
and the question I had was I

523
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,940
howdy her is are there provisions in the
API that handle

524
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:44,240
Hosur clients doubt except the task but
don't perform the work

525
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,790
as I handled by the job spaces jobs
bases

526
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,440
your job specials spaces handles all the
low-level

527
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,240
everything a min just call an object to
deal with whatever

528
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,150
function that you won t really covers
just another sentence or two

529
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,820
configurable

530
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,980
timeout that occurs yep ed there's just
it

531
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,590
you can set under different variables
and in the jobs bases API's

532
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,880
card you know there's a two hundred
report but

533
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,390
E you know whatever you can think I V
for to do it pretty much will do

534
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,850
the it you can't I'm out for API how
long a patch

535
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,030
we a who should wait before get the test
television work on a test before get rid

536
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,170
of it put it back

537
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,260
you all those kinda things a

538
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,030
in the burn spaces wrap around the Java
API Witcher setup

539
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:33,200
day does had project emails

540
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,140
does have all those kinda features I've
still cover all possible features that

541
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,420
Jobs bases covered but

542
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:45,420
do cover naked choke

543
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,510
night will he want me im stick around
today summer so that though

544
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,850
pic dark

545
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:56,020
actually just before you finish

546
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,620
I just remembered one thing if anyone in
this room

547
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,409
and I'm assuming you although how to use
peachy peach

548
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:07,789
crips program a if people here do not

549
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:10,799
want people like myself for him

550
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,520
or just other people running attacks on
their passwords

551
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,649
by hi the recommend

552
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,100
you download a worklist which is called

553
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,110
the dice where worklist and with dice
where you can generate a password

554
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,279
by taking five dice and role and to you

555
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:34,809
read the dice from right to left and
from the corresponding numbers

556
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:38,158
you look those numbers up on your day
spillover

557
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,559
list and that gives you word and if you
have

558
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,820
85 27 word passphrase

559
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,010
that will actually be he

560
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,039
its strong enough that chances are that
will be cracked

561
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,809
next like 100 million years on this we
have unisom breakthrough

562
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,960
quantum party at that brings up a good
point on

563
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,539
passwords aren't the best way to secure
things but we're going to use 'em

564
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:05,730
anything over 10 characters as someone
almost completely sufficient to give a

565
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,690
couple of treating

566
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,350
things because the key space for 10
characters at 95 possible

567
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,149
things especially was not the chair
recognizable is

568
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:19,000
just beyond huge were talkin 10,000
computers to take weeks to

569
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,190
to even put a dent in it so just make it
10 characters

570
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,210
in your pretty much okay in don't use a
dictionary it's an addiction

571
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:34,210
or in any language this my dictionary as
polls

572
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,920
with them

573
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,230
hot difficult welcome president took
back to crack

574
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,590
in both passed reverses like EP
passphrase 0

575
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:48,690
I'm little imply a password me but if we
determine that the San

576
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,520
the DM sorry the deal billion admin
password

577
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,090
love crack which is a really good
cracking software

578
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,520
by the best the props the Boston

579
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,400
it departed esta tracking software out
there for

580
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,450
for the 11 passes passwords and it does
it does it well

581
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,550
and I would recommend just doing that on
a single computer

582
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,440
the distributing that because the way
that you can crack that women passwords

583
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,379
it is the only dependable force that
would otherwise

584
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:24,310
the of last crack is

585
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,310
L 0 locked

586
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:31,009
crack l0 PhD

587
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:37,530
crack yes we're back you i was just
wondering

588
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,169
how does the cracker know when it's done
and

589
00:34:41,168 --> 00:34:44,750
also are like you're trying to get a URL
how do you know

590
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,840
like how was it intelligent it still did
got into the reasons that the resort

591
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,159
thing called the the entry

592
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,710
object if it's if it's not normal it
done

593
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,179
if it is no it is and is it possible
that if distributing this like

594
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,480
stay on a Web trying to get into a
website you might cause like

595
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,940
DDoS attacks lutely I'm we tested this
against plenty over

596
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,030
website in you the activities extremely
noticeable

597
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,490
using a thousand goes against the
website um the thing though

598
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,980
you know mean unless you doing serious
log watching this year serious this

599
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,500
admin

600
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,310
you don't notice that's up in unless
someone cause it's as he did with it

601
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,160
really slow

602
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,180
that's what that's cool that's you
computing and watermarking which the

603
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,850
idea that

604
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,069
that so you only want forty test going
at a time even if you have a thousand

605
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,840
computers

606
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,210
you're using so some you have other idle
time maintain its the only having

607
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,520
X 40 little tax at a time at the 1000
machine just in each one

608
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,710
we took quite a while before taking on
the task so

609
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,650
you there are ways to avoid being
noticed that mean I'm surprised him teen

610
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:47,140
more tax like this make its website sits
really easy way to get passwords

611
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,480
and didn't really watch the laws on up
they watch it

612
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,030
in if some alarm systems that say they
kill this one host keeps trying

613
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,040
but we're talking about we talking about
the you know

614
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,830
50 host there are hundreds or thousands
those UK really notice it

615
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,600
you might notice that something is
attacking we can possibly block it

616
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,660
doesn't pose Sonicare but that's three

617
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:13,589
heavy-handed it do you know anything

618
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,290
and they were written it you that you
crack

619
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,400
you pass rate pgp your

620
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,700
its even sure yeah I mean if someone has
a PGP passphrase at the characters are

621
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,119
you can take characters and distributed
across a thousand

622
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,869
machines yet gonna fall apart pretty
quick but

623
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:35,300
writer clyde well

624
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,130
me.i iraq you don't know if anyone has
written a client for but I've written a

625
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:38,470
little

626
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,980
thing they just calls the program
directly because the API directly just

627
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,350
rising over and over and over again

628
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:48,160
so the DPG papi does exist its
functional

629
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,339
you can just look up at a open up a EU
PE

630
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,800
good thing try the password again are

631
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,890
comment can you come in a little bit on
the legality you

632
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,020
cracking you're mentioning be in yeah I
am if it's your file

633
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:08,450
you can you can open I mean interview on
it you can crack your own passwords

634
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,530
the other is really weird because data
is in

635
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,740
property but it is its intellectual
property

636
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,740
which has a whole different governing
center rules I'm not a lawyer but I work

637
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,450
with them every day

638
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,590
so don't take my thing as legal advice
but I kinda know

639
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,859
something about so the idea is this um

640
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:30,240
if it's your filed your private property
people aren't allowed

641
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,180
to breaking fiction especially pitfalls
and the the it the

642
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,580
the MTA there are other are any of the
other acceptable

643
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,270
caption in the real just aren't legally
that the break them um

644
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:45,040
with your file you can break it you can
break it but if you work for a company

645
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,710
and you were given the right by the
company to crack that say your sysadmin

646
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,740
they say hey look

647
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,030
just keep monitors on our employees and
want to walk back there stuff that is

648
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,650
completely

649
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,619
you can tolley the germ please stop by
one because your part of an umbrella

650
00:37:58,619 --> 00:37:59,320
organization

651
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,589
very different can the government come
in in in Rieger files as the

652
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:07,330
12 that without a war one several or
yeah and that's what we do

653
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,190
I mean once we have the hard drive
confiscated from a machine its

654
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,339
that's ours and we do it we want to it
when we try to keep principally sound

655
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:16,009
obviously but

656
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:22,390
do whatever we want to at that point
cool

657
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,509
the 12 character thing

658
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:29,890
on 5,000 nodes Falkirk a password

659
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,450
the we had initially 5,000 notary would
add another

660
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,820
10,000 at some point a so the

661
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:41,220
the weeks or so don't know why we did
either cuz we didn't really have to

662
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:44,460
I think I think it was to boost and say
hey expect okay

663
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,609
password with a view them

664
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:51,100
we actually the first letter a bit that
was the thing so

665
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:58,100
we're a mask the first letter out and
then do the rest

666
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,620
I

667
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,609
okay the for the first question is where
do I get by 1000 jeans

668
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,700
and the answer I will create Rita Rita
Maia they

669
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,110
how big a small something happens I'll
say Mo Money mo problems

670
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,640
that's how we get by those machines a.m.
there's cash involved in what I do

671
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,279
in they aren't that great machine that
picking up a dollar machine into a

672
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,510
promising these days did not go for that
much money in which have a lot of them

673
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,810
in a big group in their strung together

674
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:52,140
with some of them are

675
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:56,440
that as well which is a different issue
a.m. an

676
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,850
or something um if one were to

677
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,480
hypothetically a use their neighbors

678
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,940
machines that are connected via Wireless
they could hypothetically

679
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,070
at war machine to the pool well legally

680
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,380
legally the only way to do it is either
there there are some grid computing

681
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,170
legal grid computing systems out there

682
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:23,810
distributed dotnet is one of them and
but there was these for cracking

683
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,529
very large he's based things for
challenge reasons only but there are

684
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,970
there some public with computing

685
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,470
facilities and he should just look at
grid computing on Google

686
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,200
see what's around was a thousand of them

687
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,220
that's cool the computers I mean it's
the

688
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,940
someone was that bill to 30,000 no
closer answer cracking passwords a

689
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,840
the thinking about it other than the
other than to have much better on

690
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,490
crackle

691
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:50,040
systems at: because the bill build a
bomb

692
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,279
with a computer same thing emit

693
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,050
it you have a computer computers
computer that has no not a good or bad

694
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:05,050
to it go were questioning gotta go

695
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,900
um each each one has a different
cracking other them

696
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,240
to crack against it I

697
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,330
world usually I know kinda what one's
gonna be

698
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,220
before I run against a look at right one
at that point we don't have that kind of

699
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,180
time and we just say

700
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,680
you screw it this thing can stay secret

701
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,279
and we'll just get a court order to open
it which we can do sometimes

702
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,060
and that the persons that are gone
forever and that workers recruit cool

703
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,970
thanks
