the thank you welcome to the fifth hope

23
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:31,090
is this is my fifth your problem and

24
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,319
John I have been around for a little
while

25
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:41,229
white-collar old-school I first read
about John

26
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,279
in an article in magazine called

27
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:48,359
esquire hide doubted you people have Rep

28
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,389
a little bit before your I was actually
in the Army stationed in Germany at the

29
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:53,919
time

30
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:57,319
and it was known that I was interested
in phones

31
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,909
on punch telex overseas in
communications

32
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,469
but the nose and phones pictures in this
article yet

33
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,840
and little did I know that little
article by Ron Rosenbaum would lead me

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,620
two-stage front olive you explaining how
some other stuff works

35
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,439
basically the blue box well

36
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,620
the way I like to tell the story when
you placed

37
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,590
I'm going to use past tense because
member blue boxes are just totally

38
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,489
obsolete now

39
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,510
hillary's 26 shirts

40
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,719
with the blue box medics on them is the
well because they're cool yes

41
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,760
but the thing is people still why did
the schematic

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,290
and the question was how to provide a
schematic

43
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,379
provide value for money and know that it
was totally useless to you

44
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,620
as a schematic so the printed on a
T-shirt to make a cool teacher

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,569
and of course up in the corner is the
little risk america

46
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,409
the black box drawing from abbie
hoffman's book

47
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,340
steal this book where on page 87

48
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,629
he explains how a black box works but

49
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,870
you'll have to find a disgruntled New
England Telephone engineer

50
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,450
to find the actual schematic and turn
the page 288

51
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,680
and there's a schematic when you placed

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,079
a long distance phone call your

53
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:26,579
telephone your touch-tone telephone
produce a certain set of frequencies

54
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:30,069
that told the central office incoming
register

55
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:34,530
where you are your call to go you would
pass that information on

56
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,730
to the truck equipment that would pass
long

57
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,989
the phone call a blue box well

58
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,170
when you ask the operator to place the
call for you

59
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,159
shoes at a higher level than your
central office and her touch-tone pad

60
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,420
eight different center frequencies that
directly control

61
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,819
the long lines equipment right this is
that the trunk

62
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:01,529
level as opposed to Subscriber level so

63
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:04,790
the blue box operator basically

64
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,798
has a touch-tone pad with the operators
frequencies

65
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,629
now to place a blue box call

66
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:16,560
actually II yet I like the start of here

67
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,970
by giving you guys a little course on
how the blue box works

68
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,970
and also have a special treat have the
biggest

69
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:26,000
tandems back ever on recording

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,050
and as a special treat tonight and they
give you

71
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,470
what it's all about you could actually
experience

72
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,870
the thrill at the use a blue box

73
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:40,030
artist take place at this stage want to
give credit where credit is due

74
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,539
this site obtained from Richard cash in

75
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,139
Richard cash this web site he used to be
marked her name back in the old days

76
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,889
well Richard Castle has a website called
phone trips

77
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:55,110
out wide web dot matter Wide Web dot com
slash

78
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,410
phone trips up believe that this
recording was from that

79
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,270
have special permission from richard is
had you here this tonight

80
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,000
audio people you're ready to patching
the audio here we go

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,590
step 1: was to get onto the
long-distance network

82
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,120
usually by just simply dialing a long
distance call

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
anything that was more than about 75
miles out would go over

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,360
type carrier system that would respond
to 2600

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,370
hey

86
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,550
by way that what you're hearing there is
number one

87
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,819
crossbar subscriber level

88
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:41,819
are line these do not exist anymore

89
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,850
the number that's ringing at this point
doesn't matter

90
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,680
what's important is that this call is
gone over a truck from New York to it

91
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
distant for a

92
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,680
which can be reset by 2600

93
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,309
that's the supervision handshake

94
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:11,469
of book on and now it's waiting for new
digits

95
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:17,529
which been will supply stopping the tape
now

96
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:20,989
what he dialed was 216 054

97
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:24,079
064 these are all ruling

98
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,110
the network at the nineteen seventies
had

99
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,789
routing codes for tendons in all major
cities

100
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,459
the first code 216 054

101
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,949
is the routing code for Youngstown Ohio
be

102
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:41,610
064 in the area code 216

103
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,219
is the ruling code for Canton both these
across party and

104
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:49,639
when Ben keys in the sequence the 4a

105
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,779
into which he is key picks up the trunk
to Youngstown Ohio

106
00:06:53,779 --> 00:07:00,659
and sends 064 that tick is the for a
cutting through to Youngstown Ohio after

107
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:01,429
having sent

108
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,489
064 now what does Youngstown

109
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:08,309
do with the 064 well it picks up a trunk
to Canton

110
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:11,459
that's the code for Canton but having
been sent

111
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:15,360
only the routing code and no digits to
follow it it's simply

112
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,489
dumpsters into the Canton trunk without
sending any

113
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:25,219
in other words its tax that's the sound
at Youngstown Ohio dumping it into a

114
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,459
trip to Canton the

115
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:31,499
and that's the handshake from can't
Canton Ohio

116
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:38,499
is now ready to receive its thats 054

117
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:43,149
064 this causes can to pick up the trunk
to Youngstown and send

118
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:47,969
064 now we're in Youngstown again which

119
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,439
stacks in the canton and in Canton paulk

120
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,599
gives us the handshake and we'll do
another 05 4064

121
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,319
now read Youngstown again

122
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,709
Youngstown stacks to Canton paulk

123
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:11,869
that's the handshake and here we go
again same digits

124
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:15,899
Youngstown Canton paulk

125
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:22,709
and sick now the connection is gone so
long that the handshake is all you can

126
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:23,069
hear

127
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,439
paulk now on that supervision place you
can really hear

128
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,199
multiple links both on the of work and
beyond is going around again

129
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:38,348
paulk

130
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,439
that was such a short place that you
didn't get to hear all the on hooks

131
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:49,439
you've been listening to the beginning
at the original 1975 take

132
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:52,839
stretched to allow me to describe what's
going on

133
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,639
let me go back and play this part again
without stopping to talk on

134
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:03,639
all

135
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,160
by the way I wanted to say one thing
their teeth some

136
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,959
at the beginning at cokie wholesome

137
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,210
start and the announcer fail to mention
check

138
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:45,210
asked

139
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:53,490
Patrick

140
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:01,830
ok

141
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:09,630
check check

142
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:20,180
ok

143
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:28,410
longer

144
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,450
okay what happened there okay

145
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,670
like stopping at this point and I wanted
to make a few things

146
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,829
clear in case you might be confused are

147
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,410
the announcer basically said was giving
the digits

148
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,199
for going to Canton place the youngstown

149
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,940
and what you might might have noticed
was that there's

150
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,150
two tone to the beginning and at the and
the first time at the beginning is

151
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,250
called key polls

152
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,450
net are 1700 plus

153
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,680
I I think 1100 and then the start

154
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,620
tony is 1700 plus 1500 and

155
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,540
basically the 1700 town was only used
for the key post to start the 1700s

156
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,599
owners also used

157
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,620
to do it another special people's called
people's to which is often used for

158
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,870
international switching

159
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,400
which is normally not used in domestic
this is because call this

160
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,320
see one signaling okay it's a strictly a
2600 and shake

161
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,010
there are other more complex method
signaling called I see

162
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,660
see for c5 person like that signaling

163
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,900
where using a combination of twenty six
hundred-plus

164
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,380
2400 and there's a more complex
handshaking involved

165
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,110
at this point I go ahead turned over to
Cheshire and talk a little bit I'm gonna

166
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,140
get the next part the tape cued up here

167
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,550
the designations C-one such

168
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,250
and our schism 2600 was I believe

169
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,610
law RR 2 regional something to

170
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,860
and these were designations the
international Telecommunications Union

171
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,160
abuses United Nations agency based in
Geneva Switzerland

172
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,350
either on very large building very close

173
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,570
peloton sean's the headquarters

174
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,540
in geneva I know to 1979 when I went
over for telecom something I

175
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,349
actually visit building because I want
to visit their library I

176
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,460
with your new york city about 12 years
and served

177
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,120
Mike favorite basements was the basement
of the United Nations building

178
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,500
there is a bookstore there anyone going
through the public entrance go

179
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,380
downstairs

180
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,610
next the post office buy stamps allowing
you to

181
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,120
are put more money in the UN Treasuries
in some Member States

182
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,900
going to that library

183
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,150
used to have are many other publications
%uh the International Telecommunications

184
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,550
Union

185
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,710
I would go in I would peruse the book's

186
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,790
I would kinda be in the wake during your
Isaac

187
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,280
excuse me sir you please the called

188
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,370
and let me read the books wonderful

189
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,900
got so good

190
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,060
accessed telex every couple years I
would say telex to the IQ Geneva

191
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,330
asking for two copies of her book
catalog would take one into the books

192
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,440
because they never got them so are going
through these books

193
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,250
you learn early well over in europe you
know every three miles

194
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,310
national border so everything over there
is by

195
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,210
international agreement national
standards and these

196
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,420
national standards are referred to as
recommendations

197
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,170
because you cannot dictate to sovereign
nations how they will

198
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,700
run their post office which was runs Cup

199
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,680
you may only make recommendations
courses recommendations pack

200
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,720
before law but they are agreed upon

201
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,110
by two different nation-states not only
in Europe but

202
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,400
among the other international occasions
Union member states

203
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,110
around the world its these designations
well

204
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,110
keep in mind that the phone was invented
here in America

205
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,320
and AT&T elwebbs

206
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,630
would usually send being contingent
overseas

207
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,200
a course there are other companies such
as Ericsson in Sweden

208
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,910
all these International said be hammered
together

209
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,170
you may have noticed in the front your
phonebook list country codes

210
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,360
and North America is country code

211
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,230
one and overseas

212
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,800
gutsy 49 for Germany on a German
business card you'll see

213
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,450
a plus sign than 49 a city code

214
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,040
and the number the plus sign really
means and your country's

215
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,099
exit code before my country so on my
business cards has

216
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,670
plus one 321 for my phone number

217
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,780
america's ago using you know dial
one-plus Eureka

218
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,800
but now one is Mike Country ca

219
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,090
Mike overseas how to reach me

220
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,460
I'm I want to add a little bit about
country about area codes in

221
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,590
foreign countries in Europe in the UK
%ah the bigger the city

222
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,370
the smaller the area code the smaller
the city

223
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,500
the bigger the area code is used the
rule of thumb

224
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,570
if you're in a very small village in the
UK your area code might be

225
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,360
06 a 13 if you're in London

226
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,510
the record might be well used to be 0
what is it

227
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,830
one 01 before and then they changed the
record to be 07

228
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,610
in 2008 081 yeah I remember that the
thing is that

229
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,640
the reason for that are the all fashion

230
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,110
rotary dials because you would hold

231
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,420
incoming register for longer because the
number

232
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,610
and its officers one pulse prodigious 9

233
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,020
dialing in nine min 9 pulses

234
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,180
and so large cities just like it

235
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,310
one in their meaning London and then
Justin go there

236
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,340
and then you have the jurors exchanges

237
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,090
the smaller cities you take up more time

238
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,370
dialing that number and hold the
incoming register longer but you won't

239
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,880
have as many calls to those small cities

240
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,990
so overall in the grand scheme of things
you can

241
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,150
level out the amount of time needed to
hold incoming register

242
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,090
therefore how many incoming just you
need

243
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,550
to set up your telephone exchange yeah
and bigger cities

244
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,870
course required more serious smaller

245
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,280
I went to the first public hearings here
in New York City

246
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,280
when they were going to do something
really radical

247
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,480
they were going to split 212 and create
718

248
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,810
in the other boroughs

249
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,640
school I say that because we got a
lecture from the borough presidents

250
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,189
Brooklyn when people referring to the
outer boroughs

251
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:09,500
there is Manhattan then there are the
other burrows

252
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,640
please keep that in mind

253
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,390
I pointed out in my testimony that and
by the way

254
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,250
I think I was about the only person all
the people testifying

255
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,280
in favor the split

256
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,339
it was technologically based of course
they were running out

257
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:32,000
exchanges of course they needed all I
asked in return

258
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,070
was to remove the one dollar a month
charge four touchdown

259
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,260
making it easier for people to dial the
extra three digits

260
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,810
and my reasoning was the incoming
registers

261
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,940
because in 1964 my folks brought me down

262
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,060
Rochester New York for the new york
rules there

263
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,510
needless to say my favored millions was
the

264
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,970
Bell System they had an exhibit there

265
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,330
or you could rotary dial your telephone
number and what time you

266
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,750
and then right next to it touchtone

267
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,020
and you could touch tone your number in
and it would hike and is

268
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,170
unfamiliar is I was with touchdown back
then because

269
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,350
was brand new course I still a better
time with the touchtone

270
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,840
head rotary dial and pointed this out to
the Commission

271
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,090
massacres committed dial not in those

272
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,010
you take this would bring out the phone
doubt heard fast

273
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:30,800
works great when you want to try to win
the radio contest

274
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,520
but but in my testimony i pointed out

275
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,139
that touchtone meant that you held the
incoming register

276
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,050
for last time you would not need as many
incoming registers

277
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,139
and therefore reduce the cost are

278
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,220
these changeover to the new area code

279
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,590
well I was told this was not be reached
hearing

280
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,159
and that my testimony was not Balaji the
point

281
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,260
this particular hearing but the mission

282
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,800
large in come back

283
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,450
when they had a rate here that was by

284
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,500
I want to get back now into some more
the recordings this

285
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,340
this record this I'm kinda skipping I
it's a very long recording

286
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,570
and you can see me after the session is
over and I can tell you where you can

287
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,649
get a full copy of this

288
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,760
arm I will probably wind up putting it
on my website

289
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,970
and butting into an FTP area

290
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,220
where you can FTP and haven't had a
chance to do that yet or you can

291
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,620
possibly get it up

292
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,590
the Wide Web on trips website as well
again say I seventy megabyte way filed

293
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,439
by the way so it's pretty large

294
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,810
one of my jobs with the whole
conferences is following the conference

295
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,290
I set up a page Lovelinks from the
conference including speaker's notes

296
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,280
and so this will be one of the links
that will have on the website give me

297
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,428
about a week or two after the conference

298
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,830
to set up will be at hope dotnet

299
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,428
yeah okay let me let me get started on
this and this

300
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,679
sec

301
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,690
stick

302
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,000
just

303
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,919
this mean in the other boys here on
areas that bill

304
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,980
successfully calls my name's or

305
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,980
and it is just so cool

306
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,910
I might want to add one more thing
really quick before this goes that the

307
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,050
tone you here right there the 2600

308
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,590
first that's what is called 8 phone a
plier

309
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,178
I desist special little device

310
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:47,090
set aside because back in the old days
when you were calling a number that was

311
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,530
like

312
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,110
Nani number you get a reorder quick busy

313
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,250
well they would use the 2600 flash
because that's how they could pass

314
00:20:55,250 --> 00:21:02,250
reorder across a carrier to a distant
office

315
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:14,300
setting up the stack now

316
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,899
heck what they're doing is they're gonna
actually hard

317
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,830
chrome to them and then they're going to
be doing some experiment

318
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:28,970
check flash forward and back

319
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,490
they can lb a basically hi the amplifier
on

320
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,590
the already and originating line

321
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,610
here but it sounds like from there and
then they'll take the audio amplifier

322
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,460
and connect complete Hall line

323
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,160
and here from that and

324
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,980
really interesting things here

325
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,880
yeah and yeah and then at the end of
course a good drop of them

326
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,880
care all the only thing kinda all
unravel

327
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:07,928
calling the phone next to them now
something about yep

328
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:13,799
be wondering up sorta busy signal your
every time we get a supervision

329
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:17,580
book except first time with initial is

330
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,939
ball type sound that his which

331
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,109
is easy that is being put on the line

332
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:29,279
Forest Hills reason told

333
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,489
told yes that's why we're hearing NC

334
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:37,659
it's not hard exactly something for
schools the reason it does that is

335
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:39,669
because in the old days busy signal
issues

336
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:44,639
close supervision was call was so long

337
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,849
given what we're discussing

338
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:51,499
right not this long but not on nothing
was ever this long

339
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:55,369
hope but you could see where

340
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:59,429
Mike there was a busy signal flashing
far and you could kind

341
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,080
lose that in the quake right so stop

342
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,779
by one of the things he always goes
first

343
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:10,960
when calls himself is just flashes

344
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,099
picks up the phone things up but not
long enough to charge

345
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:20,580
by the way that tone

346
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,478
plier will only work on if the other

347
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:28,499
and hasn't been of took long enough to
actually causes supervision

348
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:32,349
her charge back to your local office and
so

349
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:36,309
the next time you were to let's see if
take call had been answered

350
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:43,309
and then if they flashed books which
again you won't get that on a plane ok

351
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,968
ok that is this task

352
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:55,729
etc and what you're hearing is your

353
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:59,940
pair ok from the called

354
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,029
from the phone it's actually calling ok

355
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:06,909
ok always doing is picking up the other
phone

356
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,830
ok expect the could

357
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,619
ok

358
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,509
ok here they're just picking up and hang
it up real quick and

359
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:22,259
sure an election worker almost makes it
back ok

360
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,549
ok ok

361
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,570
doing short flask sometimes

362
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:36,668
so sure if they don't even get all the
way back ok ok

363
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:43,089
ok ok ok pack ok

364
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:48,099
ok act ok

365
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:53,019
ask ok at ok

366
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:56,339
ok

367
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:01,629
ok ok

368
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:07,239
their ok ok

369
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:14,200
ok okay

370
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,229
Minister firepower think park

371
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:24,559
step back a progress know what to do now
is this

372
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,849
switching it over to the other line if
you hear very faint in the background

373
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:31,129
here the 2600

374
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,479
what you're hearing is just a little bit
elite

375
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:38,570
through from the filters because when
the liner struck

376
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,309
the day for pet first step

377
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:45,668
when the lines are on hook

378
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,700
okay the circuitry

379
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,070
between the two trunks are both
whistling 2600 at each other the reason

380
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,428
why you can't hear them

381
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:59,009
is because filters are kicked in however
in this particular

382
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:02,099
instance with that so many trunk
stacking

383
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:06,439
summit that 26 sometimes will leak
through in some time to hear it but it's

384
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,129
very faint and

385
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:11,509
this this actually casa rather you
interesting thing in my

386
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:14,989
case when I was actually in court

387
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:19,429
the phone company was claiming that I
was using electricity

388
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:23,629
in the phone line and I running expert
witness to testify

389
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:27,479
that I was actually using less
electricity then more electricity

390
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,339
because the

391
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,369
costlier was sending back to lines was
really

392
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:34,609
are removed so to speak

393
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:38,908
does actually using less electricity and
of course it just got really confused

394
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:39,819
about that

395
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:46,819
me me nursing going either way now

now queuing up the this was a stance

422
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:04,819
the actual shutting down that stack up
tandems

423
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:08,529
I just want to explain for those few may
have caught

424
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:13,639
the story of the icing my greatest
exploit are

425
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:17,009
getting off ma I area code yes hi

426

personal Erica are this

427
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,749
New York City someone it split was good
training

428
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:27,349
because after a move to Florida few
years back inside split

429
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:32,299
407 area code around such a Florida the
Orlando area and the area around Cape

430
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:32,879
Canaveral

431
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:37,069
well are the trial if I move down there
because I like to watch rockets go

432
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:40,168
up and keep going up its it's amazing
stuff

433
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:45,599
yeah we both watched the cassini when it
took off and now it's already arrived

434
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,158
so other guys put four ohs

435
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,729
southern and I look at the schedule at
work

436
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:58,609
go turned out nobody else when you and
when I made the papers in Exeter

437
00:29:58,609 --> 00:30:02,329
407 great outcry decides to have nose

438
00:30:02,329 --> 00:30:05,989
hearings a look at the day now gotta
work that day too

439
00:30:05,989 --> 00:30:10,099
well a minute money it was look up on
the internet

440
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,718
it was anything interesting so I'm
appalled

441
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:16,879
phone freak I know to look on the
website the North American number

442
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:19,939
administration i'm looking down the list
now

443
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:23,099
you folks list to a new jersey 202 DC

444
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:26,389
blah blah blah get smart available for
geographically

445
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:29,809
going down with his number 321

446
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:33,779
widest yes

447
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:38,109
now I remember why that's you to me it's
time to bring down the word processor

448
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:42,049
down bring down the web browser and
bring up the word processor

449
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:46,069
to prepare my testimony from publishers
mission here show up

450
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:49,969
I'm resentful because it's just it's so
silly I'm sure somebody will come up

451
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:51,479
with that but it was the combination

452
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:56,099
phone freak and space cadet maybe come
up with this idea

453
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:59,809
I presented to the public service
commission and said listen

454
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:05,299
we who live around Cape Canaveral like
countdown capital of the world we want

455
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,069
area code

456
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:11,619
3 to one they love the idea

457
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,749
from get-go back

458
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:18,659
one commissioner told me you know we
love to have this kind of sugar coating

459
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:22,659
to put on the process up to split
because it's going to be hard for a lot

460
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:23,339
of people

461
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,719
retirees the chairman

462
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:30,109
the Commission came up to me after the
meeting

463
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:34,119
and she thanks very much I wanna thank
you very much for your testimony today

464
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:38,359
because we went in and we requested

465
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:45,009
such as you presented in your testimony
and they told us it was prior Terry I of

466
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:46,869
course about the on their public website

467
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:51,539
so how proprietary could so I figured

468
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:55,449
I asked for it they approved it must be
my area code

469
00:31:55,449 --> 00:32:02,289
but I share alright

470
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,479
I am this this is the this is the

471
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:08,589
tear down on the train as seen from

472
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:12,109
the called and not the end

473
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:15,709
car not not the call and but they're
received and

474
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:19,579
the phone call the caller hung up the
phone

475
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:24,249
right caller hung up the phone and you
are at the called in this is what you

476
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:24,819
would hear

477
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:30,309
last hour Iraq Iraq

478
00:32:30,309 --> 00:32:35,759

479
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:40,759
ok ok

480
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,669
but they're still closed

481
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:49,059
when their ex classic click

482
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:56,059
can you keep

483
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:02,869
part of the United Nations story

484
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:06,309
tonight used to hang out

485
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:09,959
little slower so often they knew that I
knew the books

486
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:14,219
and everyone might be in there not even
at the eye to use expert someplace else

487
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:15,259
come up with a customer

488
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:20,139
excuse me sir have a custom used that
defines information 0

489
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:23,419
a problem ago over this is gonna be in
this for seal

490
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:27,319
and chapter I would songbook for

491
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:32,668
it was very symbiotic relationship hang
out I'm sure

492
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:36,690
they do not sell those publications in
the UN bookstore anymore

493
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,009
but you can just go to I T U

494
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:43,159
dot I and she and look over

495
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:46,539
publications they do have a bill
collector is publicly available for sale

496
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:50,229
okay I'm ready here

497
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:53,659
this next part it a peer talks about
what is called flash

498
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:57,440
forward okay the this is basically a
signal

499
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,819
are the but the I'll just let the
narrator explain this

500
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:04,259
Anna Bligh the flash forward will book
will follow this

501
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:07,899
and this would be the last part the
dugout this section here and then

502
00:34:07,899 --> 00:34:09,739
there's another section on here

503
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:14,549
have a much much bigger stack that you
do you just got here

504
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:17,879
out set up a stack actually not been
made

505
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,649
on this tape had not been record

506
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:26,339
I guess we should describe what he means
by I guess the proper term

507
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:29,719
ring normally that's what they call
which it

508
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,480
send short first funny these are all
told

509
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,779
them so they and want to repeat the
signal along the way

510
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:42,168
wonderful now in the actual network the
ring forward was used

511
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:46,279
to sing operator put up a connection

512
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:49,339
need back on the line your local
operator

513
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:55,569
could Iran key which would send you a
picture 2600

514
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:58,759
flash and when you get a connection

515
00:34:58,759 --> 00:35:03,190
this long you bring forward assuming
that it passes it along which this one

516
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,230
your you get to hear that little first

517
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,739
forward on sent very slowly one

518
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:13,279
next next extolled cascading down

519
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:17,049
counseling and because they're with a
tape recorder on

520
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:22,450
you know for on the call in line

521
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:29,450
ok

522
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,859
ok

523
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:38,980
gonna explain a little bit more about
what you're hearing their

524
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,400
I what you're hearing their in this
FlashForward is

525
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,920
the the call the calling

526
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,710
and basically sends a very short burst
2600

527
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:53,859
called and and the reason why such delay
between the different

528
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:57,299
click click click click click CC there
is it the

529
00:35:57,299 --> 00:36:01,109
is as it goes down the chain switching
tandems

530
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,200
the before that the second tenant can
react it's got to get to fast forward

531
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,309
in the first 10 miss second then react
to the third

532
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:14,180
30 X for third a sec the third can't go
to the fourth until it receives its

533
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,769
technology single back

534
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:19,589
and that's why the sad to day between
each digital kitchen pitching

535
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:24,788
chinks as crawls down the track

536
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:30,529
idk

537
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:34,279
think

538
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:38,109
in this is instigated by a quick burst
26 entered which I'm not long enough to

539
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:40,489
disconnect call

540
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,799
idk

541
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:50,799
but long enough to fuck

542
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:56,308
okay cue make it to the big stack now

543
00:36:56,309 --> 00:37:01,349
case over holds toward

544
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:06,180
like so let me mention that a lot of my
stories are on my little disk

545
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:12,200
Hyderabad called called of course their
secrets there in the manual

546
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,599
its is all in hypertext the budget web
pages from various my web sites

547
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,200
it's available for fifteen dollars on
the Internet at Cheshire catalyst dot

548
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,819
com

549
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:24,259
or I'll be summed up in the back the
vendor area

550
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:27,779
after the talk here have fifteen dollars

551
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:31,420
arm the alive awesome

552
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,789
abroad my little laptop with me with my
seven dollars other Asian army keyboard

553
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:38,789
most keywords others time we were
actually round two dollars to nap

554
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,660
dollars

555
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,598
well I decide get the seven dollar
keyboard the one with the mag stripe

556
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:45,059
reader

557
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,930
so I will be selling just for 50 cents
apiece

558
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:55,930
and then fifty census like find out
what's really in your wallet

559
00:37:56,019 --> 00:37:59,799
okay I'm back this is commit last final
is cool I played at the end

560
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:03,140
and because it already ended the actual
recording and

561
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,160
I am there are two voices here on their
one

562
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,410
Voice is his nickname is doorbell and
other one is Bill Akers bill is an old

563
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,359
old

564
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,469
he sees my mentor he was the one who
both

565
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:18,730
spend endless nights crawling through
the phone network

566
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,380
looking through every single tandem
looking through every single TTC Kobe

567
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,710
could possibly find

568
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,289
find the most interesting sounds we
could find in the trucks

569
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:30,309
and in bill also is a very good social
engineer

570
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:34,250
and so is Danny denny's the blind kid
who actually turn me on

571
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,969
the phone freaking he was the one that
actually had a Captain Crunch whistle

572
00:38:37,969 --> 00:38:42,250
and I he was a man of course that told
me all about it and how I got that name

573
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:47,339
Captain Crunch everybody ask yes it on
my FAQ on my website

574
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:51,390
which is a web crunchers dot com forward
slash French in case you

575
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,969
iron and wanna know what it is I I still
get

576
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:58,049
kinda clean up the website and moved it
over to new server recently and there

577
00:38:58,049 --> 00:38:58,839
are some

578
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:02,019
there are some links may not be totally
active yet

579
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:05,210
on so in this last bit thing here this
is where they actually

580
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,259
this is an actual huge huge 10inch
texas' got probably the biggest win it

581
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:14,170
be recorded and at the setup was not
recorded

582
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,119
sure is awesome to hear here saws let it
play to the end

583
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,650
talk a little bit more about some things
in in it pretty interesting

584
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:29,650
sec

585
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,560
listen to the longest stack I could find
it all the tape libraries

586
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,230
I S and try to approximately count links

587
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,630
I should warn you that it's

588
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,740
there are few up what I think are
nonessential links

589
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:50,930
in the middle so simple you know with
the path once this when he didn't record

590
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,560
the setup

591
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:56,070
I he just you know stacked it up and
that was enough to know where he went

592
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,440
yeah I would too an amazing

593
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,640
and back its gone most expensive
nicotine

594
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,049
and that my disconnect panetta

595
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,580
ago there there are you

596
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,980
have a ride for the main thing maybe

597
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,540
okay at them back

598
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,609
now on the receiving end

599
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:26,609
fashion to cry and the 26 unfortunately
one of his lungs is not really forwards

600
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:36,839
that actually isn't going all the way
down you do it again

601
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:43,839
ok

602
00:40:53,230 --> 00:41:00,230
became interested and now

603
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:14,619
here's disconnect have it recording the
biggest an image that we've been able to

604
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:30,180
do

605
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,169
I let me talk a little bit more about
some the other 10 a.m. stacking

606
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:33,990
technology

607
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:39,049
we were involved in mom that of course
was called a £10m stack using number

608
00:41:39,049 --> 00:41:39,440
one

609
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,470
crossbar cannons which allowed the %ah

610
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:45,930
possibility of trumping dropping you
know the tracks as was described by the

611
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,279
narrator at the very beginning

612
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:52,170
other ways attendance tacking which is
cool not quite as effective is this

613
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,170
with the use it guard ban let me explain
what card and does

614
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,039
up I take about an about three to five
minutes can't explain this

615
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,349
think this is a really interesting
concept I was the actual pioneering this

616
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:07,749
in this bigger technology I was at the
time

617
00:42:07,749 --> 00:42:11,359
doing a lot of video analysis so it's
like an engineer and who's doing things

618
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,038
with audio and bandwidth than

619
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,190
spectral analysis sound analyzer also
they're happy staff

620
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,470
and I wanna things I noticed is that the

621
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:25,920
out the audio link other telephone line
has a very sharp cut off after three

622
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,130
thousand hurts

623
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,859
the audio band with the telephone was
flat from 300 to 3000

624
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:36,150
immediately after three thousand headed
very sharp drop-off

625
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,999
and the reason for that why's that the
reason the audio channels had to be very

626
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,029
precise

627
00:42:41,029 --> 00:42:45,569
is cuz they were backed up against other
audio channels have a very sharp cut off

628
00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:46,519
at the end

629
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:51,339
it turns out that 3200 hurts it's
possible the San

630
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:54,400
sound through 3200 now

631
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,660
2600 loan in the phone is what's
required

632
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,339
dump a call of if you had any other
frequencies present

633
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:05,538
are along with 2600 it won't drop off

634
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:10,230
this is called guard band in the reason
for that is a lot people's voices have

635
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,720
2600 in their voices especially

636
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,259
someone with very high pitched voice and
it

637
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:19,769
and at the very beginning when this
system was developed they ran into

638
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:20,640
problems

639
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,879
infield testing and a lot of time these
calls got disconnected prematurely

640
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,480
because

641
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,650
the audio from a human voice with would
be long enough for the equipment to trip

642
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,460
you are taught there's any other
frequencies present

643
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,130
in the band like normal speech this
would not disconnect use

644
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:41,660
what is called guard so what we're able
to do

645
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,410
is sent 3200 along with 2600 and what we
do when we blew it offered

646
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:52,118
disconnected with 26 and we'd also
passed 3200 along with the 2600

647
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,390
by the time it and went from them for
stop to the second hop

648
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,420
it it gotta keep the 3200 gotta

649
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:04,440
teeny weeny down below the threshold
required for the 2600 actually tripped

650
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,029
the circuit

651
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:08,749
so the 3200 actually allowed the 26
senate-passed

652
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:13,769
from the first link the second me in the
second link with drop-off

653
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:18,460
ok teaching and then you pump up the
volume up to 3200 you said

654
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,670
tad more go to the next link in ago 2g

655
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:24,670
and he kept doing at your kept bringing
down

656
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,309
are bringing up to 3200 with attenuate
down go to a certain point

657
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:32,920
afterwards 3200 became so high in
amplitude

658
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,180
bitch got a lot intermodulation
distortion along with it and that was

659
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,499
you

660
00:44:36,499 --> 00:44:39,839
real limiting factor but this would own
this will never work

661
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,989
using acoustical cutler connection to
the phone line

662
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:47,460
only work if you were actually directly
connected the phone line

663
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,890
indirectly couple the audio into the
phone line at reasonably high volumes

664
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:55,680
do this this was called guard banding
and into a lot some

665
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,419
really really interesting tax cuz here's
what happens

666
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,160
a lot of times when you're out in a
really really suburban area

667
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,640
you get your operator in your
connections the operator is thirty

668
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,170
is 2600 see you can't even get 2600

669
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,930
through the truck without the 3200 so
you guard and through that point get

670
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,149
past the operator

671
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,589
and get to the from the next truck next
and that allowed

672
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:23,799
tone freaking back to work on all on
these

673
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:28,390
really urban areas which is normally
would not be allowed because what

674
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:33,420
happened in 1972 1973

675
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,589
the phone company started centralizing
everything

676
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:39,690
instead having a small little towns have
their own

677
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:43,009
operators what they would do is the
operators

678
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:47,160
the small towns actually be located in
nearest big city

679
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,670
rents Ridgecrest Calif out in the desert
with a

680
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,869
main hot and the nurses little town
called

681
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:58,390
valor at which is down Death Valley with
the hub town in it

682
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:01,950
used to have operators not anymore so I
picked up the paper on

683
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,289
at that I would pick up the operator
copy would be in Ridgecrest

684
00:46:05,289 --> 00:46:09,369
seventy miles away and that link course
with 26 Senate which meant blue boxes

685
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:09,960
couldn't be

686
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:14,000
done from that phone without actually
using the 3200

687
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,539
cardin and that's weird how that all
worked

688
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:24,559
I anyway as it seems yeah I think it's
time for questions

689
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,009
withers microphone right here course

690
00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:31,329
first up is Rob

691
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:34,779
I do have a reputation maintaining
imagining it well

692
00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:38,069
level okay I'm

693
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:41,589
I remembered you were talking about the
old phone

694
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:44,900
on things I remember the the commercial
the touchstone races

695
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,339
but the dial phone and everything I
remember when my parents had to put a

696
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,759
lock on the phone

697
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:54,819
when Kevin hitting are when him at the
phone had to be taken out of the south

698
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:58,509
reminded me when I had my parents had a
lot of back trouble

you too young to remember their looks
like there's very few closer

703
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,410
on rotary dials people used to put a
lock in the number one

704
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:22,549
you could turn the dial past one my
passion for other number call me

705
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:25,730
thank you are able to add a song to play

706
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:30,109
chuckling marcia play later the way to
get better cause was just

707
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:33,460
it looks which number yeah thing on
mention that's the way I

708
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,739
when the when they put the lock on I on
the three other

709
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:40,130
whatever number I just flash very good
level thanks very much in fact

710
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:47,130
next question good

711
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:52,170
help 0 by the way I don't have to get
these the crank up their

712
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,430
I wanted to mention about Frank bones in
it when one iPhone trips

713
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:00,190
we went to a place called grasshopper
Junction Arizona

714
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:03,619
and in this little town there was this
little rest stop way up the middle

715
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:04,180
nowhere

716
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,200
and actually had a crank phone are real

717
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,210
authentic crank phone picked up

718
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:14,160
it was a potato masher kinda here

719
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,118
you spoke little speak like I'm doing
now in the microphone

720
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,289
and I thought your teeth like who box

721
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:27,359
factor in the crash some in the operator

722
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,308
and yes indeedy West 26 and the operator
but the mouthpiece on the phone was

723
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:35,250
went up recently good quality actually
take the blue box stones may actually

724
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,410
was able to make a blue box call

725
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:42,279
to the UK on a crank phone up

726
00:48:42,279 --> 00:48:46,289
the classics I'm wondering does any of
this

727
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:49,680
a quick min is it still in use the the

728
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,049
you know the country's already museum
somewhere

729
00:48:53,049 --> 00:48:56,640
it used to be dog companies like your
chin and Siemens that women to come

730
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,529
out love their northern Europe cities
that was sold to third world countries

731
00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:06,130
because make a very good maintenance on
them in their home countries and such

732
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:09,469
are when they got to the

733
00:49:09,469 --> 00:49:13,359
less-developed nations are victims
wasn't quite so good but that they did

734
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,019
mu them around yes Central American
countries like

735
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:21,140
think police had a had using reason then
me but I don't believe

736
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,609
C-one signaling is actually in existence
anymore

737
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:28,930
what you've heard basically was
equipment that does not exist anymore

738
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:33,980
very rare course bank thank goodness
this is actually recorded for posterity

739
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:38,680
then able to bring it to you tonight
like Smithsonian or anything

740
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,009
with that at like the smithsonian

741
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:45,869
yeah actually you know I was many people
come up to me and asked me know when it

742
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:47,190
is set up a phone free

743
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:52,769
museum and I talk to the people at the
Computer History Museum in Mountain View

744
00:49:52,769 --> 00:49:56,670
and these guys are pretty 30 hit to the
idea is have had a chance to really do

745
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,180
that I can get myself a number one

746
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,859
crossbar switch and if he and a
colleague myself a tsp a

747
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:07,089
tsps operator console and perhaps even
when the old cork cork board consuls

748
00:50:07,089 --> 00:50:10,450
I have set something up I have seen
where some

749
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,789
independent telcos worthy abandoned
central office

750
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:17,000
the Telephone Pioneers America have set
up museums

751
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,299
I'm not to ratify the web link to find
those I'll try and set that up

752
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:24,269
photos American had links to some others

753
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:28,989
user ok arm two questions actually first
one you stacked up the tandems

754
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:32,630
this ever show up on a network control
Center

755
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,859
have AT&T and the second question is are

756
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:38,930
with a lot of the eight hundred-numbers
being routed

757
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,930
applied for tech support being routed
overseas

758
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,649
is there any possibility of some former
boxing still occurring

759
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,989
on these overseas eight hundred-numbers

760
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:53,650
a.m. okay um the eight hundred-numbers
this particular

761
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,809
these particular calls here was not
actually placed over an eight

762
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:57,809
hundred-number

763
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:00,859
these were actually paid for calls that

764
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:04,969
they called into a distant city in this
particular call was actually not made

765
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:05,920
for free

766
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,420
I might add it was just basically
calling from one

767
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,960
one connection to another connect show
the the operation

768
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,089
number one crossbar up it wasn't until
much much later

769
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:21,619
I'd say probably close to five or six
years later and

770
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:24,960
until the time that 800 members were
starting to terminate in foreign

771
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,059
countries

772
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:30,690
there was a time I remember that
Bulgaria and parts of eastern europe you

773
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:31,719
could go and call

774
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:36,289
AT&T direct and you had it you had a
C-five connection

775
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:39,579
your AT&T operator and it was possible
to grab it sees

776
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:44,769
c5 tractors by calling your local AT&T
USA direct number that was possible

777
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:48,859
only up until just recently since that
time course all equipment is gone away

778
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:53,019
next question please if any in this old
equipment still isn't like i'm looking

779
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:53,579
for. like us

780
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,880
steps where chura like a I remember I
was in Utah one

781
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,890
and I picked up a pay phone in the rest
area

782
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,989
and I heard that all die out on that
here the old-fashioned I'll

783
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:08,160
home you know before my time one before
national standards

784
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,629
subtitled I got the phone was broken

785
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:15,829
I at 10 think I might want to mention
back in California

786
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:19,940
well there I okay there are two kinds of
steps which is that were in existence

787
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,920
back

788
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,710
time now is due in San phone hacking one
was in Los Gatos Calif was

789
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,309
general telephone it had in it had a
steps which

790
00:52:28,309 --> 00:52:32,230
that had the most amazing access to a
truck I have ever seen

791
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:35,849
you pick up the phone you take your
thing like this you swipe it down ok

792
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:37,199
switch real fast

793
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:42,430
her client plop right into a truck how
could that be any easier than that

794
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,069
and then in in now and then in pacific
telephone have what is called Pacific

795
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:47,680
step

796
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,680
for that in that you would die out part
of an area code like

797
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,910
to wine and this will only work if the

798
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,699
if you didn't have to dial +1 for the
area code which at that time in that

799
00:52:57,699 --> 00:52:58,789
area

800
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:02,489
415 and 40 way were actually

801
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:06,529
two different area code you can call
from one area to the next without the

802
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:08,949
area code because the prefixes

803
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:12,769
were not overlapping okay I think we're
getting pretty clear

804
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:15,779
worked at the end of our time rebel I'm
sorry

805
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:19,410
you've got the last word and does
anybody have any more one

806
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,390
roanoke when we gonna have talked about
this before we have to go for the next

807
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:22,859
session

808
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:26,859
have a strong hardware and with the song
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much

809
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:33,859
