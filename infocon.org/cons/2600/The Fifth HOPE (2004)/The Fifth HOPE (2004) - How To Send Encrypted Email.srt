1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:04,310
suboptimal but it's the best we could do
are without delaying even further

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,450
so way thank you so much I L

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,700
really appreciate a hope in a in buying

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,670
us to talk with you in again I I
apologize for the primitive display

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,189
are option that were left with but if
you can

6
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:22,850
on just a deal with that let's begin

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,170
okay this is my partner in crime Peter
Leon

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,510
the runs other couple male that war
organizational

9
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:36,600
aspect amid I'm more or less technically

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,579
okay it's early morning 9 a.m. and look
at all the technical difficulties we

11
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:41,079
have

12
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,079
did you guys sleep I didn't I thanks for
being here

13
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,809
okay as a takes a an extended effort

14
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,239
to get up this early okay

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,520
okay we're gonna talk about some other
problems that cropped a male tries to

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,030
solve

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,910
some of our missions and objectives

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,030
we're gonna we can go through program
demonstration

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,120
unfortunately as things are just simply
if you

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,020
arm we can go through some the
algorithms

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,229
and protocols that we use

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,070
and we can go over some the client and
server platforms

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,030
we are using and we can go a and talk
about

24
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,530
future directions and go into
question/answer

25
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,730
think okay why his crypt

26
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,420
why he is in cryptic email important
well

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,540
it protects your privacy and your assets
it's pretty cool

28
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,060
I think it's kinda need to be able to
use send

29
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,970
and receive confidential information

30
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,310
are it's free speech you have every
right to

31
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,790
do so teams encryption communications
with them

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,869
people and so you should be able to
speak your mind

33
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:09,009
are and what we should do

34
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,540
we should try and make it is pervasive
as possible

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,010
and as out there as possible so that

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,489
I it becomes are so entrenched that

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,019
no one and nothing can take away from us
okay

38
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,290
so how do we get people to use

39
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,450
incurred email I'll I call this the
grandma problem how do you get your

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,320
grandma

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,590
to communicate with you securely arm

42
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,940
it's kinda hard you know the programs
that are out there you know

43
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,300
there the required you know a high-level
Paul

44
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,780
eat them in order to get them up and
running

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,870
securely to so

46
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,970
that's one of the main problems occur
the mail tries to address is just

47
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,650
how do we make it easy are also you want

48
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,360
your the solution to be migratory you

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,260
don't want to be you don't wanna have to
carry your keys

50
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,320
are on a USB dongle you want to

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,410
or a floppy you wanna just be able to go
anywhere

52
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,850
sit down at a at a terminal and just log
in

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,930
and

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,939
and use your public and private keys we
want

55
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:31,720
$80,000 in for install client

56
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,770
that means that no special software

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,250
has to be install known on standards of

58
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,390
rather so you go to Kinkos and

59
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,620
know they have the registry on lockdown
they do all these kind of things

60
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,600
more to prevent from a nefarious Lee
installing software which is a good

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,050
thing

62
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,180
up but with the web browser

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,620
you should be able to login and using
fifty

64
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,710
now we want the

65
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,190
platform to the open we wanted to be
open source

66
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,200
we don't we want to be you know have a
ubiquitous

67
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,520
user experience when use a program it to
look like mail it should look like an

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,180
XML

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,590
I we want the transparency

70
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,570
open source gives you that disclosed the
source

71
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,330
at the client and server all it becomes

72
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,969
no question as to what the problem still
okay

73
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,060
work here this is tying into some other
problems that were times all

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,389
what's the threat model okay we're
always gonna sing

75
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:44,500
Eve is around she's always listening to
our traffic okay that's just a given

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,090
and we're also gonna sing that now lori
is kinda their

77
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,389
our re has your system

78
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:55,520
or can get your system so

79
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,130
threat model says four tries to address

80
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,120
can we build the system such that the
user's private keys and messages and I'm

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,960
we compromised with a zero install

82
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,099
point and Kim the transport be locked
down

83
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:18,479
such thats evil in here basically liners

84
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,130
fiction

85
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:27,409
okay so again our mission is to promote
the private communications and

86
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,530
again the technical objective is to
answer the frat mom questions

87
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,780
so we want security at the transport
layer and

88
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,210
and and message encryption and we don't
want to disclose

89
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:45,799
any by the key information to any agent
other than the user themselves okay so

90
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,310
the demonstration is kinda bored

91
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:54,310
but if you guys want you can go to www
dot crib bill mailed at work

92
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,378
to have a full demonstrations now

93
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,189
okay

94
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:04,300
what are we doing here what is the a

95
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,330
technology when encryption platform that
were used

96
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,508
were using el-gamal 1024

97
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:14,069
and I have no

98
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,550
year that's as always say is good but at
the time when I was writing this in

99
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,419
99 early 2000 arce was doing

100
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,000
numbered so I couldn't use it although
technically I could have started using

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,889
it and then all the sudden the patent
expires and

102
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,520
everything will be hunky-dory but

103
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,340
things as the as they were right
released it

104
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,229
as is with el-gamal GPG uses oldham
all's well

105
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:46,580
as a default a sin the symmetric cipher

106
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,690
for symmetric ciphers wheeze blowfish
it's a great

107
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,130
unencumbered public domain cycle really
strong

108
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,050
128 bit good stuff the protocols

109
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,759
we have secure XML message access
protocol

110
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,340
sex nap and x-men X map

111
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,889
is something like I now but

112
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:15,610
in XML again are when I was writing this
I didn't know I didn't want to

113
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,240
incorporate I'm ap because from I
thought it was a pain

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,490
okay so their protocols

115
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,840
can all be found on our website criminal
that work and you can go through the

116
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,669
documentation and look through the park
all specifications

117
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,698
but what this Hall

118
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:37,159
is going to be mostly about

119
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:41,379
is trying to show

120
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,779
how we lock down the user's private keys

121
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,099
and secure session so how we can prevent
now re from gaining

122
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,099
any salient information about your
private keys

123
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,520
and how we lock down

124
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,659
the transport session now crypto male as
it stands is a job aptly

125
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:07,509
okay and at the time

126
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:11,389
there was no SS L capabilities

127
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,469
embedded in the the M's

128
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:17,620
she couldn't do HTTPS without

129
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,889
are incorporating incorporating your own

130
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:25,729
berkeley independent libraries so that
they get kinda big

131
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:29,979
you get kind of lobby because and I can
sit there and right

132
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,909
you know my own a SSL layer I'm gonna
use someone else's

133
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,159
that's pretty good practice but at the
time

134
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,760
I I was thinking about way

135
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,829
to try and a boy having to use

136
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:48,850
as a selling tireless so the next a
couple minutes will be focused on

137
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,769
how we use normal HD p with the

138
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,519
tablets that the server the HTTPS

139
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,100
how we're gonna lock down session okay

140
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,080
when you first start out IncrediMail
you're presented with the login form and

141
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,670
you just

142
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:11,279
type in your username and that gets a
minute

143
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,290
reach yes so assume

144
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,079
that a you you submit that securely

145
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,399
and you post it needs yes

146
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,410
then the server generates

147
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,600
a sixteen bite session key that's just
your session a

148
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,459
that I'm sorry is generates a 16 byte
session encryption key

149
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:39,690
okay this is used to encrypt the session
between the client and server then

150
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,220
the server generates 16 by session token
okay

151
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,529
this is the session client/server
identified then the server generates a

152
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,330
sixteen by

153
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,790
session cloak token

154
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,939
okay this is going to be a little

155
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:00,998
challenge and the server generates

156
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:04,079
a sixteen by train them blowfish Clokey

157
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,649
K that's used to encrypts

158
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,699
the challenge and put in

159
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:13,620
HTTP headers

160
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,350
okay so the server passes the client
passes the appli-

161
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,370
all those things it passes the session
token

162
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,920
which represents the app with session
with the server

163
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,029
it passes the encryption key K

164
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:30,430
how that clients or we're going to
encrypt the the

165
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,850
the traffic with 128 blowfish

166
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,899
it passes the PLO token

167
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,670
which is basically this tote this

168
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,160
this token challenge and a session

169
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,880
cloaking friction key

170
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,310
now the Apple it reads up the parameters
and in theory

171
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,130
because the the the form was submitted
securely

172
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,390
in theory the only one who knows about
this parameter is Asian

173
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,569
is the client answer

174
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,030
okay so whenever the Apple it wants to
communicate with the server

175
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,420
okay the Apple it blowfish in crips

176
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,209
the session cloak token with the cloak
token key

177
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,920
this effectively authenticates the point

178
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,990
at HTTP layer so too quick

179
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,950
acid test verified that only the single
client

180
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,680
and the server I'll are talking

181
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,149
so

182
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:40,949
the Apple it constructs all this
information sticks in the header

183
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:45,089
it encrypts it in perhaps the Blowfish
bankrupted session token

184
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:52,089
and several looks up the token and if
they can't find it it's in there

185
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,740
and the server compares the cloak tokens
and if there's

186
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,240
same if they're not the same then more
okay

187
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,790
so again why do all this

188
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,939
Whitehall by effectively try and

189
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,040
do each DPS overreach

190
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,620
p again is because there weren't any SSL
faculties at the time

191
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,680
to communicate are with within the Java
VM

192
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,880
answer also win

193
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,750
a if there are libraries you have to

194
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,430
you have to arm me the the server

195
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,730
and client on use authenticated
certificates

196
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:41,720
so I didn't have any money at the time

197
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,260
okay

198
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,950
are any questions about the SSI secure
session initialization

199
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:52,230
yes

200
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,509
okay well the Apple it is parameterized

201
00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:02,509
through SSL

202
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,940
yes there's arm well okay

203
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,430
my assumption was is that I know why I'm

204
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,980
good a

205
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,260
do that because the

206
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,700
which mccauley because all if the

207
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,240
I don't know I guess if there's a man
now on as a self to reach

208
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,920
yes you know it is what it is you could

209
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,280
are like we need just with any SL
communications

210
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,649
someone gets in the middle and someone
gets in the middle

211
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,010
right

212
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,490
arm

213
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,720
yeah on on on SSL yeah

214
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,720
yeah

215
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,430
yeah

216
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,100
yeah assume that the client after the
client posts

217
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,519
to reach yes the form and the server
passes back the applic and the primers

218
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,149
Asian that that information is
confidential

219
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:20,149
it will have to sing everyone does are

220
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:23,700
you know a we'll probably wrong someone
out there

221
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:30,029
knows how to do it probably

222
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:37,029
yes

223
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:44,980
any other questions going as a side
yessir

224
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,160
a gate the last right now they last

225
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,160
the 30 minutes yes

226
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,190
okay if if our if she closes

227
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,130
the you're saying if she closes the

228
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:16,130
Navigator window

229
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:23,089
we have to close the window it'll send
athlete will be sent a message

230
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,430
are I think it's our basically

231
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,800
on destroy mean okay and on destroyed it

232
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,279
automagically logs out whether that's
conform in Java

233
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,709
p.m. behavior across all platforms is

234
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,779
your is yes is anyone's I

235
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:45,430
but while at the same that all
relatively new

236
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,730
the M's our complaint yes yessir

237
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:55,730
yes yes

238
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,240
what excuse me okay it's in the Java VM

239
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,590
so when the Java VM goes who arm

240
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,560
basically if the Java VM things up are
its memory

241
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,670
and everything should be fine I'm sorry
I will have to defer a horse

242
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,870
possibility a you know I'll

243
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,590
you know for the behavior I'll

244
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,290
abiam's I you know thats its were the
toughest things

245
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,800
on its its it's really hard because

246
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,030
all the software is laid on top of each
other so

247
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,310
if the be and doesn't clean up after you
close it and can go in there

248
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,410
and take a peek at it that's a distinct
possibility yet that's the reality

249
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:54,410
live with other other systems

250
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,930
while in memory no arm its

251
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:03,230
it's all in the AM

252
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,500
yes that's it that that is a possibility
but I

253
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,230
I do not make that effort we're going to
seem that the

254
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,950
our client machine that that grandma is
using

255
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,300
is are exactly not loaded with spy hair

256
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,619
it's a really big assumption these days
okay and

257
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,620
it's not it's not a it's not a huge

258
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,530
reality but you know we're gonna we're
just gonna sing that there's

259
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,270
nothing terribly malicious against
against but it's entirely possible

260
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:41,020
okay so let's talk about the fret my
let's get back to the right now

261
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,030
you know the SSI okay so we've got no

262
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,330
we've I told HT yes we did all those
words just

263
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,429
freakin yell get away from paying
searched

264
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,980
and incorporating issues 250 6 K

265
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,060
berkeley independent as a cell library
that's gonna be

266
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,460
really slow because it's written and job

267
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,520
okay generally

268
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,010
you know you know software crypto with
Java

269
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,180
me that's like two strikes against re:
okay

270
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,430
bad enough you know just do is offer
you're gonna really burns in cycles

271
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,910
okay okay

272
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,230
the print model arm basically

273
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,620
let's talk about now re: okay with at
the end of this

274
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,900
show that now lori while he may pinch me

275
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,400
okay is gonna have a little bit a hard
time

276
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,570
you know with today's are where the
current implementation terms size

277
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,179
all the I'll little bit are directed
that current implementations

278
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,270
size is arm on

279
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,180
a particular user are focus

280
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,850
is not terribly strong but neither are
passed freezes in general

281
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,840
so if you do if you read the passphrase
back it says basically

282
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,590
pass please yeah it they're basically
useless

283
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,000
because the domain the search to me is

284
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,450
phone you know basically today's years
is

285
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,010
a is pretty small in any event all we're
gonna

286
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,950
were gonna try and golden read my own
show you

287
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,970
that now we might have a little bit of a
difficult time

288
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,730
so creating an account basically the
appli-

289
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,350
creates are a public and private key
pair

290
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,760
and the user chooses a passphrase

291
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,840
and the Apple its EBC blow fishing trips

292
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,649
private key with the pass for CMU the
entire TV a passphrase

293
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,770
scripted with the

294
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,050
up I'm sorry yet private key infected
with the entirety of the passphrase

295
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,290
then the Apple it seems

296
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,250
half the hash a pass Brees okay

297
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,480
got your her did private key you got
half the hash

298
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,920
the past

299
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,920
now the Apple it basically constructs a
little Mack at the end

300
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,960
the private people all a blob just to
make sure

301
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,550
you know for later use to authenticate
that

302
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,030
arm the private key information has
changed so we got

303
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,600
after hashing pastoris the cryptid
private key

304
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,210
have been with the entire to the
passphrase and we've got the Little Mac

305
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,370
and the Apple it sends the message

306
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,510
new account with the public key

307
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:34,320
being cryptic private key that infected
with the entirety of the passphrase

308
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,700
half the hash in the passphrase

309
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:46,220
and the encrypt it has to the passphrase
so basically goes through SSRI

310
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,320
before it sends that and it just sends
the new account and then not

311
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,250
is anyone remember the web or from Maher
that

312
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,780
with it Turkish guy or something I'll is
like a a

313
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,820
he wrote he wrote this cheesy geo cities
web page in it said I kiss you

314
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,658
you remember that welcome to my site I
kiss you

315
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:10,789
okay all this was a around that time and
I was

316
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:15,940
making the protocol so this is noted it
made him a wired

317
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:22,070
dollars okay so so what do we have on
the server

318
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,309
we've got the encrypt it private key
infected with the entirety of the

319
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,168
passphrase

320
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:31,109
got the public key okay everyone can
have each other's public keys

321
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:35,249
that a problem right I'll sing arm

322
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:38,570
and we've got the the Mac love

323
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,389
the private key now what happens when
you try to log in

324
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:46,179
okay so the client wants

325
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,460
its private key information right he
wants to send and receive

326
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,769
and ending cryptic messages so

327
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:57,139
basically what happens is the app which
requests

328
00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:00,659
a passphrase then the Apple it

329
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,679
Shaw winds and seas happened those bits

330
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,429
okay and then it logs in

331
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:12,970
with half the hash in the past freeze

332
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:16,490
so basically you know we set up all the
HCP I

333
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,830
HTTP headers for as a size

334
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,879
secure session initialization and the
Apple it sends the

335
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,480
the payload than the server compares

336
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,309
half the hash in the passphrase

337
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,190
and if it's if it's successful it sends

338
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:41,710
the encrypt it private key and Dean
cryptid

339
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,530
hash the private key so half the hassle

340
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,590
the up the passphrase is stored encrypt
it again

341
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,929
basically as a past

342
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,460
okay

343
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,270
so then the Apple its basically d crips
the private key in and then it

344
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:07,930
authenticates the Mac

345
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:11,940
and if the crib to hash no matter
doesn't match up tennis courts bill

346
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,770
so at this point what does the server no

347
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,289
the server knows that most half hashing
casper's

348
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:28,690
okay so the server maintains a high
level security at the user's identity

349
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,230
without compromising

350
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,740
private okay so going back to the rat
model

351
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,260
now or you may control the server only
knows half the house

352
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,450
has Brees nodded

353
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,069
okay

354
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:47,239
any questions about that

355
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:52,159
yessir

356
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,039
its I think it's the first

357
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,680
yes

358
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,380
yes absolutely two towers are now it
that would be a concern

359
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,450
if it took a random number I'll all

360
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,750
I'll up bites the first time or

361
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,010
you know or the second time and someone

362
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,310
are listening passively could determine
the entirety

363
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,460
no could get the whole hasher a bit

364
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,820
and so that's that's certainly not good
you don't want to

365
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:27,820
disclose a any more information than you
have to

366
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,899
no the server all encryption and
decryption is dawn

367
00:24:33,899 --> 00:24:36,959
on assigned Java applet okay

368
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:39,989
look let's talk about let's talk about
this

369
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:43,809
now lori has gotten your machine okay

370
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:47,129
what does he know is borked your server
and

371
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:50,809
has got he's got half hashing a
passphrase

372
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:54,979
and that's it what can he do can he
change

373
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:59,070
the signed ap lit can you change the
behavior

374
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:06,070
the signed output

375
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,520
basically this is no problem right mean
got this thing for

376
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,650
did I you've got this all you got this
up with that

377
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,720
signed by a crossing the border would
propel males not

378
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,790
okay lists Newton let's assume that no
these are not poison certs okay

379
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,700
and that these are good certs okay and I
bought my Verisign

380
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,480
certificate and they verified new third
when & Bradstreet

381
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,770
and I signed it okay could someone
changed by

382
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,879
a could same someone

383
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,260
replace my binary in still have to come
up

384
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,590
with the bracts I information and

385
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,920
I don't think so because I keep the
private key for encrypting

386
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,360
or signing the outlet offline

387
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,440
those desiring there so

388
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,370
now is gonna have a really really hard
time

389
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:07,860
changing the behavior my aptly but he
can certainly get the session okay

390
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,130
dames up he's got my session by if
you're sending

391
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:16,090
50 email in you re the

392
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,519
bits %uh end and encrypting messages
should be fine

393
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,049
you can know what only your browsing are
heated

394
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:27,570
see all your ex nap traffic but if the
contents of the message are interrupted

395
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:33,120
and and message encryption provided the
output is not poisoned

396
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,250
and I purport that it probably won't be
because

397
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,250
it supposed to be sign and so he can't
change it

398
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,950
that that the message

399
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,750
contents going and and are don't
relatively

400
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:54,750
lockdown yessum

401
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,289
a okay

402
00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:00,309
it's a whole long story it really is
it's a long story

403
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:03,889
you can go to www up to mail that work
arm

404
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,929
unfortunately arm that were viewing it
under this thing

405
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:14,330
there's no no network and its absolute
indefensible

406
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:20,809
member its that but if you go to www
know that work you can see that

407
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:21,730
happening

408
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,390
if you're not scared my boys inserts I

409
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,760
because I haven't paid so I'm I I deeply
apologize

410
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,280
that okay yessir

411
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:40,280
back

412
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,230
that that some that that isn't it yes

413
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,280
yes that on if you want to send it

414
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,560
a crib to mail allows basically provides
for

415
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,980
s pleaded privileges so you can send
attachments

416
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,840
so grandma wants to send a recipe and
sandals text file

417
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,800
she can do so all but the Apple needs

418
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,440
has pleaded privileges in the event that
now re-

419
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,070
places that with on this early sign

420
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,300
code then yes have employs

421
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:26,230
d

422
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,460
okay

423
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,929
I

424
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:32,549
okay so X map XML message access
protocol

425
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:36,460
you know it's just a row it's just the
my silly substitute for

426
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,970
I now I am it's nice XML you know James
Clark red re

427
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,529
XML parser expat it is so it's like
potter

428
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,679
to develop with it okay if you

429
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,130
wanna do any kind protocol development
with XML XPath

430
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,320
way to go so you guys can take a look at
that

431
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,299
so basically we can talk about the
client platform it's

432
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:02,309
you know is a Java applet use HTTP POST

433
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:06,870
on the current implementation works on
Mac OS 9

434
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,470
I got a nice ubiquitous

435
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,429
interface for the back and we use

436
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:18,559
MySQL 323 I'll

437
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,200
what's up note here is that all

438
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,129
basically there's no system user names

439
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:29,429
business no system users they're not in

440
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:32,559
unity password or anything like that
everything

441
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,908
is inside the database at the filesystem
and everything else

442
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:41,580
user base it's all inside are the MySQL
tables

443
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,740
uses any unix-based

444
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,559
web server does out a proxy GI arm

445
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:53,870
session encrypting encryption engine
employs the GPT site for

446
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,350
abortion and uses sendmail as the MTA

447
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:04,350
again here's a little pictures

448
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,950
okay

449
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,410
where are we going

450
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,870
should we use OpenPGP is base

451
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,860
I don't know sounds like good idea I
think

452
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,880
we can get a lot more people use it did

453
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,080
arm should we

454
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,899
me for you

455
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,250
is and instant messaging all this so

456
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,420
when you log in email server user

457
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,570
public

458
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,799
instant messages to each other do this
make to Grandma

459
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,929
in making you live as opposed to

460
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:44,539
emails how can we link serves

461
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:48,590
and how do we trust public use

462
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,340
user outstanding questions now as it

463
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,960
address so

464
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,330
would like you to do II in

465
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,129
in in the face my belly flop with the

466
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,190
autonomous demonstration

467
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,530
I'd like you to visit more and

468
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,539
just take a look at a the coup and

469
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,049
the the code running I I can

470
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:19,299
go over all it with anyone wants to

471
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:23,070
and basically all

472
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,720
we need help we need the

473
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,000
developers in HTML you like people

474
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,710
you are interested

475
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,820
in implementing pervasive photography

476
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:42,428
and we're gonna go to questions

477
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:45,800
yes

478
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,170
yes

479
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,980
yes

480
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,600
well

481
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,420
I don't know real

482
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,360
yeah I mean arm you know

483
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,350
at the reason why I chose el-gamal is
simply because it was unencumbered

484
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,530
okay yeah at the time I was writing it

485
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,510
a basically arce was had a patented

486
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,610
at the exact time I was writing it now

487
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,860
had a weighted three months before
deployment

488
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,890
sure I I couldn't use our say without

489
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,900
any kind whatsoever at expired but

490
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,610
if we look at what other people are
doing I

491
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,730
GPG is el-gamal default sides

492
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,940
you know get good stuff

493
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:48,940
yessir

494
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,940
okay

495
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,009
that was one other areas and

496
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,909
exploration that but the mail has yet to
all

497
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:05,559
you know go through but

498
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:09,220
in theory if per pill mill use

499
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,200
pgp years the mechanism for

500
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,600
message corruption and and and
corruption

501
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,759
then I guess we could use pgp

502
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:23,849
news

503
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:27,260
yes

504
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:34,260
huh

505
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,179
well okay II don't I don't know
necessarily the exact program

506
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:52,080
you're talking about I I guess I'm I'm
assuming Blowfish is a

507
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,540
is a encryption yeah it's a in San
encryption to

508
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,730
encryption tool okay so yes on

509
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,790
you would have to see either the
corruption tools will congress or the

510
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,420
protocols

511
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,880
speak account right arm if they're not

512
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,260
I you're certainly gonna problems that
BGP is a specification

513
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,159
the encrypt things %uh same
specification

514
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,629
in theory all one

515
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:22,100
a should be able to communicate with
each other

516
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,440
the PDP's generally very good at it if
you use pgp

517
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,850
another PT program will probably be able
to captain

518
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:35,850
it

519
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,739
yet you can get PTV from a number of
sources

520
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,079
on using I'll units for Eunice

521
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,379
rather I G PG works extremely well

522
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:51,460
and that act new privacy barred a the
new

523
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,589
PG dot or genu

524
00:34:54,589 --> 00:35:01,040
BT decor this

525
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,410
yes

526
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:10,930
you know I really haven't tried it I
maybe I can get some data points

527
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,940
I would like to try that that's a very
interesting

528
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,220
interesting question but yeah adding

529
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,220
anonymity to the picture is certain

530
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,650
something value yes

531
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:30,230
a yessir

532
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,500
here if occasions I

533
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,810
basically I don't right now trip to mail
that work does not

534
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:40,620
are in its current format does not
support that

535
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:47,620
yessir yes

536
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,450
okay that the did the message it works

537
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,799
almost like pgp are its but it's not

538
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,780
okay the message is in cryptid I'll

539
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,800
with the symmetric cipher but

540
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,710
the symmetric ciphers me is in cryptid

541
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,049
with el-gamal

542
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,410
so we're kinda like b2b I mean I it
would be very

543
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,499
all for we shouldn't to are for the
whole message

544
00:36:22,499 --> 00:36:25,849
with a asymmetric safer to ease

545
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:29,660
metric safer from its contents message
he use

546
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:36,660
asymmetric friction

547
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:45,089
arm I have thought about it yes arm

548
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:48,670
and it just so happens that most the
BN's actually do support

549
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,390
all compression

550
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,400
yes

551
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,280
yeah

552
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,000
but

553
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,640
in working towards my goal towards a
more standard message formats

554
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,819
thing that's

555
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,850
arm that might be here

556
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,220
and summer

557
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,890
II me if I were to go to open yet that
anita's par

558
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,250
what what the with the PGP

559
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,400
guys do the usual prospers

560
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,690
the ping pong message size and it
depends on your implementation I've seen

561
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,240
some

562
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,350
that don't compress lessons on that
compress based on line

563
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,900
the size message

564
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,859
any other questions

565
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:36,350
it

566
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,759
thank you so much for your time I'm
sorry that arm I didn't get

567
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,390
you demo time lobby so thank you very
much for your time I really appreciate

568
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,640
it
