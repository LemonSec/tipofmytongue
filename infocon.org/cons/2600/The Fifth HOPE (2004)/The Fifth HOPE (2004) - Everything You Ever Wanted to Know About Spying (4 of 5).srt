1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,580
quest question here i jus that is or
when here actually

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,290
I'd love that idea that you have on the
you know spreading the

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,820
envelope and and obviously it's been
used in a sense

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,850
totalitarian systems like China okay
because everybody's watching everybody

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,210
else

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,860
but here's my other idea which is you
should be

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,480
using perhaps maybe a training program
for and by the way I'm

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,630
native US citizens old you guys are real
patriots

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,390
right you should actually be using
children

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,140
because children are suspicious up a lot
of things

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,450
and if the A train properly they can
watch and then see if there's something

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,500
bad is happening

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,060
is that what you think a possibility I
me now that could be a bit big problem

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,590
well I'll tell you what's happening in
iraq

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,470
what's happening in iraq is that the
teenagers are turning out to be our best

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,160
friends

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,450
arm and and the teenagers are

18
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,090
are both have open minds and in are more
recognizing

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:03,260
I don't wanna Rico children I i want to
educate children

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,720
I believe that intelligent should be
taught in

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,080
every classroom beginning with middle
school I think we should have National

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,800
Intelligence honor societies

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,158
arm and I think people should be
rewarded

24
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,580
for setting up a zip code issue coverage

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,720
network for anything I don't care

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,330
if you want to track West Nile disease
in your neighborhood or if you want to

27
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,429
are to examine how many few neighbors
and gone and I i don't

28
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:38,549
this is not a police program this is
about neighborhood watch

29
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,600
at a at a level sophistication that the
internet now makes possible

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,920
yessir you have a comment in the ass by
question

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,729
are are you familiar with the FBI's in
for our program

32
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,510
and the efforts they've made it open
source intelligence

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,909
and dissemination you not talk about the
Library Thing

34
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,500
I no its public-private partnership

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,439
put together with the focus is corporate
america which kinda makes it

36
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,599
Italy and they have a number to call
building actually have a program

37
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,819
were you get involved you have quarterly
meetings if you get

38
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,519
the other what are the problems as they
still bring a lot other the government

39
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:17,799
bureaucracy with them

40
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:21,319
so in order to get a lot of a close
source intelligence you have to be

41
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:21,950
cleared

42
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,889
get a background check and a good stuff
but there's a lot of arm

43
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:29,340
training in Intel they stand on on a
daily and weekly basis

44
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,689
well i i I'm vaguely familiar with some
of these things

45
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,120
FBI's done but but what I really want
emphasizes is

46
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,909
security in the neighborhood is a
bottom-up 7 try process

47
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:44,260
and I like to think if the FBI is a
trawler

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,149
a federal trawler you do not catch

49
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,459
terrorists by having a federal trawler
criss crossing america

50
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,249
you catch terrorists place teaching the
local police had a fish

51
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:59,279
and that's why brent scowcroft

52
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,930
paid serious attention to to my one-page
memo on reforming intelligence

53
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,599
before he gave up on this administration
and he asked me to expand on the

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,870
Homeland Security thing

55
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,249
and what I had propose it was very
sensible was was

56
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:15,689
thirty million dollars per state

57
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:21,090
1.5 billion total for the creation of
ancient nah Rick

58
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,549
state intelligence center with with of

59
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:28,099
15 a five-man watch teams all

60
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:32,359
that was not hard-wired for
counterterrorism the mistake or making

61
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,989
across america is we're trying to hard
wire

62
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,169
a few privileged people into a cement
bunker

63
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,349
with CIA approved communications and FBI
approve communications and it's

64
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:46,180
absolutely useless for natural disasters
are crime waves or

65
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,180
of plagues emerging we can now spot

66
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,150
a an epidemic in an illegal immigrant
community between four days in four

67
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,099
weeks in advance

68
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:57,459
a previously stop by tracking the

69
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:01,389
over the grocery counter prescriptions
and the specific combinations

70
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:07,180
arm so on balance I think the FBI needs
to be a team player and it will never be

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,849
the leader

72
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,909
yeah I I would encourage you to

73
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:15,048
to look into the program because it
actually does a bottom-up approach

74
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:18,920
but here's my spy question K are are you
familiar with the book Charlie Wilson's

75
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,570
War

76
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,420
your okay are in there there was
criticism isn't particularly %uh

77
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,760
love the purges that took place in
sounds like are you were there in the

78
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,400
same

79
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,530
time frame and I wonder if you would
like to address

80
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,040
either stories around that particular
book

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,110
or their the authors commentary

82
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,130
on the the ethnic purges that happen
well that the author was trying heavily

83
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,240
on gus is

84
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,200
experience and and

85
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,390
I think stansfield turner began the
process of destroying the american

86
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,740
intelligence community

87
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,250
but because of his his naval flag
fascination with technical solutions

88
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,940
I've said that one of the biggest
mistakes we've made

89
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,710
in american intelligence a substitute a
technology for thinking

90
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,719
stansfield turner was also and I have to
tell you I'm a naval officer

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,840
but but marine see things differently
and sometimes we think I've

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,720
up a certain category love navy officers

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,050
as Percy white mice arm & Stansfield
Turner had a prissy

94
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,140
I disaffection for clandestine
intelligence

95
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,159
he's one of these guys it that thinks
it's cleaner to do it with technology

96
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,050
and so he got it s he gutted the
clandestine service

97
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,350
arm and then we had a series of
mediocrity is the only one that was

98
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,370
any any good really wished was two
counts

99
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,290
are whose book is worth reading or my
summary this book

100
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,790
think I forgot your question

101
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,350
yeah well it was it was it was you know

102
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,870
it's not so much a perch as really bad
management

103
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,040
american intelligence has never with the
possible exception of two counts it even

104
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,010
decade has problems

105
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,190
american intelligence has never been
managed professionally

106
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:17,400
arm and general odom makes this point in
his book fixing intelligence he points

107
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,670
out the DCI is generally calm

108
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,040
from a political background or a staff
suck up

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,840
background or a single discipline
background

110
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,800
and as a result they don't have the
divers on one of the very few officers I

111
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,710
know who served in three of the four
directions at CIA

112
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,490
who's done saying it has done a man who
stood up Marine Corps defense

113
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,560
Intelligence Center and then gone on to
be a girl for open source intelligence I

114
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,500
don't know anybody quite like me

115
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,870
in terms that diversity experience are

116
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:51,340
and if I were advising a DCI I would say
to him you really do need to ensure that

117
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,770
you understand

118
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,159
all the promise you I mean take my cane
as an example the director gonna say i

119
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,400
think is a particularly gifted officer

120
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,030
he can't fix an essay I mean from day
one

121
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,530
Barbara mcnamara others were fighting
him hate me

122
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,230
and and black listen to me when I said I
thought an essay should become a

123
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,100
national processing agency

124
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,870
and it should begin by having a pilot
project that does all sent

125
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,630
for all of the world on terrorism and
that then sets the

126
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,460
foundation for deciding how to search
your assets and and and where to

127
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,760
emphasize a somewhat

128
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,639
he actually got me in front of every
single general and colonel in the

129
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,139
collection division

130
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,930
and they all heard out my briefing at
the end of the same well you know geez

131
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,280
that's really nice but we do see it

132
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,440
and Hayden is on record as saying that
every time he wants to terminate a

133
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,850
program the only guy that knows all the
details is the guy that would lose his

134
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,550
job he terminated the program

135
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,830
K because the compartmentation so the
system is is desperately broken

136
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,180
it's less about purging and more about
bad management I mean I've written two

137
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,520
books on the subject I'm working on a
third

138
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,280
there have been at least another 15 to
20 books are published a list of top 20

139
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,710
intelligence books and

140
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,720
and you don't have to buy and read all
the books you just read my summaries if

141
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,400
you're willing to accept me as a

142
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,300
as a as a point of departure yes sir

143
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,940
um I wanted to thank you for actually
coming out here today

144
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,210
I like this is this has been an amazing
experience

145
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,919
and I want to see if you can shed some
light on something that that is kinda

146
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,710
like

147
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,040
personal I guess in a sense which is we

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,100
my family and I we actually came out of
cuba and

149
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,530
we made it here in the in the nineteen
sixties

150
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:34,849
the only two the only three countries is
speak proper Spanish or Cuba Colombia

151
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,259
and Spain

152
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:40,820
and yeah by the

153
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,630
moment a the quest the thing that I had
is i mean

154
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,189
you know I made it here to the united
states all six years old in our family

155
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,130
came over on

156
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,439
on a program I guess that the United
States had called the freedom flights

157
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,160
it and it was like at the height of the
Cold War and we've made it as a family

158
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,209
from

159
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,700
starting literally from 0 you know we
didn't have a

160
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,950
pasta Peyton all a piss and I kinda
thing and and and it's always

161
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,760
I've always wondered what the hell is it
about cuba exactly

162
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,050
that has put us as a nation into

163
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,440
being you know what we are to the world
which is I still don't understand it at

164
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,230
the age of 40

165
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,030
it comes back to mindset and secular
yeah comes back to the nada cuando

166
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,260
it comes back to mindset in all

167
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,000
we actually started the Cold War I mean
if you look at gym

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,030
efforts book puzzle palace and stuff on
the Soviet Union was defenseless after

169
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,270
after World War two we were running
bomber flights deep into the Soviet

170
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,829
Union over the Arctic Circle just to see
how far we can get

171
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:50,040
before they noticed how stupid is that
are and so we basically push the soviets

172
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,099
to invest heavily

173
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,000
in a military we've also been so
obsessively concerned about communism

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,470
that we accept that fascism in the
United States

175
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,100
as a trade-off I mean we imported

176
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,870
the Nazi rocket scientists and others
and if you look at call role he is a

177
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,140
direct descendant of nazi

178
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,410
war criminals okay his father changes
name

179
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,439
but the fact is rolf is in a direct path
back to nazism

180
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,040
arm and so we

181
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,030
allowed nazis to influence US policy
against communism and to make the US

182
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,079
much harder against communism we
basically built a communist bulimia

183
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,360
and the vietnam war in this whole issue
dominoes

184
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,740
turned out to be wrong now I rarely
review DVD's on Amazon but I just

185
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,860
reviewed robert mcnamara's DVD

186
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,740
and I summarizes eleven lessons and

187
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,480
you know I think mcnamara cold beer to
all the people who grew the most after

188
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,490
leaving office

189
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,690
arm

190
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,750
and there's a lot to be there's a lot to
be said their communism

191
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,150
is not a threat a and we should be
emphasizing

192
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,730
making legal legitimate democracy part
of the problem with america

193
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,260
is it's bought off let's take saddam as
an example saddam is a hotbed of

194
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,090
of terrorism it's also got a major
genocide going on

195
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,260
but because the Sudanese government
pretends to be supporting the Global War

196
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,830
on Terrorism we're letting them get away
with mass murder

197
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,280
as well as active terrorism in their own
borders

198
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,980
and so we're really living a lie living
a lie at multiple levels

199
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,390
are I said I want my press releases the
other day one hundred year war 6 France

200
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,939
I don't think I completed the mall but
the Middle East was obviously one

201
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,870
are india-pakistan cashmere all that arm

202
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:45,030
we slept through the first quarter were
lying our way through the second quarter

203
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,480
we're gonna be hurt bad in the third
quarter

204
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,600
and whether we win this game we're not
in the fourth quarter depends a lot

205
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,840
on how soon we can recover one-man
one-vote

206
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,470
arm sir thank you for the talk

207
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,500
yours likewise which

208
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
as the best those your inking

209
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,540
up three countries none of them has the
best intelligence service

210
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,579
the question was which country has the
best intelligence service

211
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:18,470
on I think every country has its
strengths and its shortcomings the

212
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,040
United States for example

213
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,569
is quite good at spending massive
amounts of money flawlessly

214
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,750
arm and in fact when I lecture when I
lecture my British in Australia and

215
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,390
colleagues say you know we're really
trading this alliance wrong what it

216
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,069
ought to be

217
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,980
is is Australian languages American
money British brains in the Canadian

218
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,360
reputation for helplessness

219
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,610
are you know that's an alliance that
works

220
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,010
arm in the south africans right now
about to build a new low since center

221
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,330
and they've learned not to take
computers from Americans

222
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,590
okay they figured that one out I said
just take the cash

223
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,060
arm but we're

224
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,110
we're good at spending money we're not
good at anything else the israelis I

225
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,350
think are good at very specific kinds of
operations

226
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,820
they're also good at using reservists
for open source intelligence collection

227
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,560
are the swedes used to be very good at
open source intelligence my partner must

228
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,330
be sure got an award from the King of
Sweden for this

229
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,150
are Scotland Yard in London the Queen of
England just gave out in order

230
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,329
the British Empire to my friend
detective Steve

231
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,800
Edwards who created the OC unit at
Scotland Yard is putting people in jail

232
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,860
big people

233
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,370
terrorists and and major corporate
criminals using no sense

234
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,190
to create these networks and link
analysis and Interpol is sending

235
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,730
questions a Scotland Yard an insider's

236
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,190
inside hours he is providing exactly
which corporate boards people connected

237
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,920
to an easy identifying people

238
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,780
doing major-league arms smuggling and
and so forth arm

239
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,839
hmm think the Indians are very good

240
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,190
in some select areas I think the French
are very good at counterintelligence

241
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,490
against arabs

242
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,800
arm the South Africans are very good at
clandestine intelligence black-on-black

243
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,250
arm in fact after the Revolution the
south africans the best blacks went into

244
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,460
intelligence

245
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,410
and to all of the whites are in the
process of training them as their

246
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,020
they're flipping on and they also the
benefit the just before the revolution

247
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,079
are there was an entire new intelligence
campus built

248
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,870
for South Africa but this still only in
nineteen bought arm

249
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,050
for their internet can I have breaks my
heart arm

250
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,090
so I don't think there is any
intelligence community that has all the

251
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,410
pieces lined up

252
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,550
you remember my little slide you had
collection

253
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,670
are counterintelligence covert action
analysis and leadership

254
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,340
there is no one community that I know of
that's got it all together

255
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,340
it's a relatively to their country
what's at

256
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,410
the same relation to the country which
intelligence service

257
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:54,089
serve their country best

258
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,420
that's a hard question I have to think
about that

259
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,090
because one of the things you really
have to consider is what

260
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,230
is the cost to our country love

261
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,230
intelligence operations that are
counterproductive

262
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,760
or cost a lot of money I think every
intelligence services has some good and

263
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,680
some bad

264
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,960
why don't you tell me what your answer
is in the we'll take it from there

265
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,420
through no and no israeli service was
there

266
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,590
it's good in narrow its it's good and
narrow casting will

267
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,110
it's also started to feel lately yes it
has and in fact

268
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,940
I I think there one of the problems with
the US not reading hebrew is that we

269
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,920
don't see the internal opposition is a
very famous

270
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,920
article was written by an israeli
general

271
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,510
about a year ago that basically said
that the Israeli policy against

272
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,819
Palestine was was

273
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,680
out of touch with reality was based on
false intelligence was political

274
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,850
manipulation

275
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,600
arm

276
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,840
in does not help to assassinate or
capture single individuals if you're

277
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,830
bulldozing entire villages at the same
time

278
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,310
arm and it's also not helpful if you're
stealing the water from the entire

279
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,950
Middle East to support an agriculture
sector

280
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,690
that is producing 3 percent of GDP this
is just flat out stupid

281
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,760
okay a No disrespect intended

282
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,040
statement of fact arm

283
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,020
and so one of the things I I'm
struggling with whether I redirect my

284
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,770
third book

285
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,160
my third book was originally intended to
focus only on the five hundred billion

286
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,400
for national security and now towing
with the idea of saying that we need a

287
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,860
new domestic intelligence agency

288
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,660
uses only open sources and methods to
understand the most pressing domestic

289
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,219
problems

290
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,290
for instance in america we have a very
pressing domestic problems with

291
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,010
the working poor that should be an
oxymoron but it's not

292
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,300
I mean the working poor is the title of
a book and it's a very delicate cycle

293
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:58,880
I mean if your child care breaks down to
the bus doesn't show up for your alarm

294
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,400
clock doesn't go off for

295
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,000
you have a major injury in your family
your entire life is destroyed

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,010
and you drop below the poverty line okay
I think we need to have intelligence

297
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,810
about our own domestic situation

298
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,198
so for example in israeli case I would
say

299
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,160
fellows we need to think about importing
food and not using so much water

300
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,120
are we need to think about asking for an
international

301
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,160
arm demilitarized zone an actually
creating a multibillion-dollar fund

302
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,650
to basically raise two generations in
peace

303
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,280
all with a thirty year commitment for
this international force tank

304
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,030
arm the whole bunch of other things but
the bottom line is I think most

305
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,720
countries do not have a grand strategy

306
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,790
they do not have an interagency
coordination process

307
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,870
they do not have holistic intelligence
covering both domestic and international

308
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,630
issues

309
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,620
in a coherent sensible way for example
our foreign aid

310
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,429
investments in Africa are trivial

311
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:06,270
compared to how we screw the africans
with with our tariffs and other

312
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,350
you know anti trade initiatives

313
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,928
so by a large I would say to you I think
most countries are on intelligence

314
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:16,850
and right now intelligence is part of
the problem international intelligence

315
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,140
is part of the problem rather than part
of the solution K

316
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,240
next yeah question

317
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,750
open source intelligence to collect

318
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,980
religions various people wouldn't on the

319
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,330
would be the the sink this intelligence
with the select few

320
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,840
now would also be world

321
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,459
open open source intelligence is a come
as you r mix and match network

322
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,630
mom and with the

323
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,030
sometimes plant panic or the entire
society

324
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,290
do forces terrorist kills

325
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,190
Allah fees associated with hope we'll
take it accordingly

326
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,810
the point is this is this is a self
healing system

327
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,520
K it's a bottom up self-healing network

328
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,160
Celso valuating self-policing this is
not command control solution

329
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,120
I wanna jump started with a 125 million
a year in government money

330
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,110
are but then I want to rapidly expand
that to 1.5 billion a year global

331
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,830
network

332
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,939
where corporations ngos businesses

333
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,929
universities newspapers all have a
vested interest in

334
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:30,040
optimizing the amount of information
that can be shared

335
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,490
and then that sharing is processed in
different ways

336
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,550
gang next next first all right here in
the back

337
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:43,210
it seems that a lot countries use their
intelligence apparatus

338
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,470
a local companies the the country

339
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,870
are the company's in that country right
in industrial espionage

340
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,750
I'm how what are some other more regis
offenders

341
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,590
know it's less France Germany Israel

342
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,300
followed by China and Russia I'll how
egregious

343
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,300
United States how well the Wii help our
industries meant

344
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,980
not well at all arm one of the problems
that we have is that most of our

345
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,910
officers

346
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,530
are focused on on hard targets on
foreign liaison

347
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,178
and they don't have economics degrees we
don't do well in economic intelligence

348
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:20,770
as best I can tell

349
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,418
I haven't had privileged access at CIA
since 1988

350
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:27,970
arm but the state department is having
the same problem

351
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,740
used to be that the state department
ideal officer which was what was called

352
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,110
whole middle of a ser he was politically
astute an able to deal with the US

353
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,179
military

354
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:40,780
what we're finding that the state
department needs today is people have a

355
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,690
deep understanding of both indigenous
history and culture

356
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,020
and macroeconomics on and so we're
talking about a

357
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,330
a Paul econ officer arm

358
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,399
so I think as globalization spreads one
of the things we haven't done you know

359
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,530
there's there's books about why people
hate America in all this

360
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,210
we haven't on a proper analysis arm

361
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,740
I E I think in terms of political legal
military

362
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,760
our socio-economic ideal cultural techno
demographic a national

363
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,419
natural geographic we haven't done a
strategic analysis

364
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:16,480
up the state of the world

365
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,679
and the US budget and what needs to
change over the next six years

366
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,330
in order to increase legitimate
governments

367
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,139
stabilize unstable failed states are and
crime

368
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,919
and disease and poverty and hunger are

369
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,200
dramatically reduce small-arms part of
the problem is were corrupt

370
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,460
we are the major manufacturer
distributor of small arms in the hands

371
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,270
of children around the world

372
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,340
arm we are the major manufacturer
distributor

373
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,280
nuclear materials in fact the last
proper s the

374
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,850
inventory of plutonium and stuff was
done in 1996

375
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,679
by David Albright out of washington on
there's more plutonium available in US

376
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,940
military installations

377
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,800
for theft %uh and we have no idea we're
all our stuff this

378
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,679
top actually from the other side that
you're mentioning in

379
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,390
earlier you said that when you were

380
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,730
assembling your intelligence assessment
you it's like the six

381
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,470
nosing had it with their arms on how can
businesses

382
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,290
better work with the government try to
take some the burden

383
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,928
of what what role do you see them taking
process lies in the matter information

384
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:28,990
yeah that's it that's a very very
helpful question

385
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,030
of first of two something called the
Society of competitive intelligence

386
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,860
professionals which is about the fourth
grade level

387
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,460
arm and I think most businesses today

388
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,550
don't do business intelligence first off
we did an analysis over competition and

389
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,139
found out that our competition

390
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,960
was more often than not and a current
middle managers thought he knew it all

391
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,470
arm and didn't need business
intelligence and didn't want to spend

392
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,110
money

393
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,400
on flying information especially
tailored information

394
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,560
arm our next

395
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,139
biggest competitor things like the
Internet in fact even other so-called

396
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,620
easy quick solutions

397
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,360
just give you a tiny think we're also
finding most published information is

398
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,800
not really valuable you actually have to
go out and collect exactly what you need

399
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,140
when you need it in relation to the very
specific

400
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,720
context you're operating in all what I
would do if I were a business

401
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,900
is I would make it a point to treat
business intelligence is a

402
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,020
specialization with direct access to the
CEO

403
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,270
and I would evaluate I'd add it to
everything this report every performance

404
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,410
evaluation

405
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,240
are which employees description number
one would be collecting utilize business

406
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,710
intelligence

407
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,910
are and then you start developing
internal program to create what are

408
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,740
called smart organizations

409
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,800
arm if I were business with interests in
the Middle East I would make it a point

410
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,370
to do a citation analysis on the Middle
East

411
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,130
and then to systematically start
identifying who the top government

412
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,060
people are

413
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,720
not only the US government but in the
Australian government and other

414
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,419
governments

415
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,130
and I would work very hard to create one
of these oh said meet up

416
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,570
virtual networks with the eight point
star for

417
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:08,570
my shared interest and I would use
information rather than money as well

418
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,169
a I have a spy question for good

419
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:20,169
say you had to sapir tomorrow how would
you do it

420
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:24,150
with a lot of prior planning

421
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,110
arm II miss the the guy that did 10
years a practical anonymity that was

422
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,860
that was an interesting topic to me arm

423
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,540
I have not invested in disappearing

424
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,668
in part because I have three children
arm

425
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:43,240
and and america is a make-or-break
situation for me

426
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,750
on but if I were disappearing I would
certainly eliminate all use of

427
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,960
electronic devices and all use a credit
cards and I would go strictly cash

428
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,520
arm and work for food

429
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,980
morning and by the way hang on a sec
hours ago

430
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,850
how would you do it ha

431
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,490
daaa a how would you do it

432
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,880
well in in my experience disappearing
takes a lot of work

433
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,840
arm actually love the one of one of John
Le Carre's books is very interesting

434
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,980
this guy had two different identities

435
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,490
one was his weekend identity and one was
is weekday identity

436
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,950
on and he would move between two
different spots which had completely

437
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,900
separate identity so that he could flush
anytime

438
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:37,500
in either direction i'm looking forward
to the Bourne Supremacy by the way

439
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,800
i mean you know these movies are
wonderful about real spying

440
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,920
gonna good morning Amarinder

441
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,040
our congratulations told you for staying
around this late

442
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,000
so good and for began for me I'm gonna
ask for the old guy schedule next year

443
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,390
same day

444
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,980
open at 10 and started a first quick
question

445
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,920
who scheduled you for first thing in the
morning after all the drinking starts

446
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,430
I am forced my hand to mister talk
yesterday morning you can get the O sad

447
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,910
story on my website

448
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,130
I hate you know they're trying to open a
day at a conventional our

449
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,760
are a conventional for who well that's
true I mean

450
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,970
you know what what I would buy what I
would do is have them replace my tapes

451
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,840
at night

452
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,380
someplace up really in your case
particularly since we know each other I

453
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,660
would say go to my website

454
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,870
read the awesome story that's what I
spend my days doing at work when I

455
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,810
should be doing real work

456
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:34,550
okay yeah i i think people let me tell
you see I am i watch the works there

457
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,139
first thing I want to do it CIA if I
ever have the chance to shut down the

458
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,290
gossip networks there is a user's group
1

459
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,010
everything including defecating lizards

460
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,310
and CIA employees spend at least a third
of their time

461
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:53,070
doing gossip about sleep apnea

462
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,919
whatever its its actually amazing you
meant a loss product in between bill

463
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,470
gates and gossip

464
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:02,730
I think we're about 25 percent
productive than in most of america

465
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,930
tonight real question here you talkin
global brain

466
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,140
know every contributing things they find
some vulnerability

467
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,790
yours some intelligence useful the
community that you you posted

468
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,030
share with everyone else we're not at
that point yet

469
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,840
arm I found my situation myself in a
situation couple times

470
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,280
with my were driving data that I find an
access point that is blatantly

471
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,610
in government installation or some
someplace you just should not have

472
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,710
a my an Open Access Point right one
particular on was a

473
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,440
provincial press step one is is is tell
the government

474
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,200
and trying to do is tell the newspaper
the problem is who

475
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,750
and without getting myself arrested as
the other happy is if you found an open

476
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,160
access point to prison

477
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,910
I don't want to end up on the other side
that wall no I mean I i think you can do

478
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,140
very well with anonymous

479
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,070
postal mail are specially if you mail it
to someone else in the mail from another

480
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,580
city

481
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:03,260
on but I think we have a responsibility
to report things like this and I just

482
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,530
had the same question or similar
question from someone in San Diego

483
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,480
and I said you tell the government and
then you tell the government that if

484
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,240
they ignore your gonna tell the
newspaper

485
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,500
I was but asset how effective is it
going to

486
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,530
the media is this going to change their
minds are they just the government to

487
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,460
scare the media

488
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,030
I and also I wouldn't for your
congressman if you

489
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:25,220
if you wanna be over ha a Canadian
remember

490
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,580
all your Canadian I thought we revoke
your passport

491
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,980
okay trying for it this is a copy

492
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:38,370
yeah now you know I in 1994 said the
hackers are to create a website

493
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,190
at which they gays corporations and the
government 30 days in which to fix

494
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:47,280
known obvious flaws and access points
and at the end a thirty days it was

495
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,180
posted publicly

496
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:54,600
I still think that's useful and in fact
2600 can render national service by

497
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,940
providing a place for

498
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,250
things like that can be reported in your
identity concealed

499
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,840
will love them right now is cycle legal
wireless internet geographical walking

500
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,550
in gym where

501
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,909
or drivers from all over the world
summit their data and

502
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,440
anybody can go in and of the state's at
least punch in their zip code

503
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,650
see all the access points they're just
check send me an email about that I will

504
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,310
your that would be fun next question

505
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,540
you mentioned that you used to work for
the CIA

506
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,070
yes and you're right both work for Cavs

question I'm I'm going to go ahead in

510
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,090

511
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:43,500

ahead and give you my ending

513
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,520

533
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
yeah good based on popular movies

534
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:17,490
other mainstream movies what in your
opinion is the most accurate or trial

535
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:21,210
all of the George Smiley books and
movies and the most ridiculous movie

536
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,710
angel com

537
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,330
if you don't send kids in the battle
like that up

538
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,520
I mean really angel is the most
ridiculous ok

539
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,770
follow a another one if you can run down
the list at seven tribes and

540
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,110
your the competency ratings you give
them gladly

541
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,360
are it's also it's also in the free chat
well I don't know if it's in a free

542
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,430
chapter of my book okay

543
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:51,910
national 50 percent on military forty
percent primarily because a targeting

544
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,600
arm police 20 percent

545
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,580
our business 30 percent but only because
the oil companies in the pharmaceuticals

546
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,449
are Academy 30 percent only because a
few really good programs

547
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:11,180
ngos 10 percent media 10 percent

548
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,770
arm religions

549
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,090
10 to 20 percent depending the night
with gets

550
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,820
really good points for falling arabs in
certain neighborhoods opus take its

551
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,090
really good points for some other stuff
it does

552
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,320
the Mormons get points but by and large
it dollars in a structured and

553
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,320
and effect is a great book on spying in
the Vatican

554
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,500
that change my mind alan dulles and I
both used to think that the Pope was the

555
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,250
most informed person on the earth

556
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:43,170
turns out he's not a lot of his priest
stupid as Cardinals are very very

557
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,370
egotistical and the the Catholic
hierarchy seems to be

558
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,090
basically dominated by Cardinals with
clerks

559
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,600
but it's interesting

560
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,350
based on the ultimate and where you see
the open source intelligence model going

561
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,360
where would that leave the traditional
model

562
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,130
National Intelligence if that if the
open source intelligence evolved to

563
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:10,820
where you would

564
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,730
like to see a I can cut what we spend a
national intelligence by a third

565
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:22,730
and redirect that the public education

566
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,890
and night you gotta last last alright
real quick

567
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,910
is the

568
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,830
based on civil liberties where do you
see ideally the divide

569
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,540
or not the divide between national
intelligence versus international

570
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,360
intelligence in the wall between the two

571
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,850
thanks for coming out sure my pleasure
well first off I think we need a

572
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,730
domestic intelligence agency that uses
only open sources and methods to keep

573
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,100
all departments a government honest

574
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,870
arm and I mean I really we we're not
getting a proper honest public

575
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,800
Intelligence Estimate for example on
water scarcity in the United States

576
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:05,520
arm second I think the FBI will never be
competent anything other than interstate

577
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,960
crime in even they're barely cell

578
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:13,240
arm I would like to see a new
counter-intelligence agency that has a

579
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,710
business counterespionage division a
national traitor

580
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,480
Counter Intelligence Division and a
domestic support

581
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,949
counterterrorism division which local
law enforcement has the lead in the

582
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,750
FBI's always in support

583
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,100
and at the FBI but this new agency is
always in support

584
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,429
the feds are not going to solve your
problems

585
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,699
yessir thank you again for being here
supplies been a

586
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,270
real gem this conference are prefaced my
question by saying that I'm

587
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,230
work for the for for a federal
government research laboratory

588
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,740
personally attest

589
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,340
to the sensation of being surrounded by
people who mean very well

590
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,580
and feeling like you're petrified by
this house

591
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,049
by bureaucracy and I you know drenched
in this

592
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,130
incompetent management basically so my
question is

593
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,660
I can you recommend any specifically
non-military

594
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,890
career pass that you think are aligned
with

595
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:14,890
this sort progressive I Intelligence
Reform the you're talking about

596
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm tempted to say nasa arm

597
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,610
nasa's got some good things going on but
they also have the same bureaucratic

598
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:30,620
problems

599
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,509
I don't I don't really see any any
centers of excellence

600
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,670
arm I think we have to create them in
fact one other things I did while I was

601
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,120
here in New York was was

602
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,380
was have lunch with with Jack Devine who
is the former head of the clandestine

603
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,430
service and wanna mild rabbis and we
were talking about business intelligence

604
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:48,890
and

605
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,009
we've both come to the conclusion that

606
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,240
tailored on-demand collection
translation and intelligence production

607
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,680
is about to get traction

608
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,310
I think broadcast news has killed itself

609
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:09,310
arm you know I mean if you watch Fox
News you deserve what you get

610
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,930
so and so i i really I really believe

611
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,359
that in the next I mean right remember
I've been laboring for fourteen years on

612
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,150
this

613
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,260
senator moynihan great senator from the
state in New York

614
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,950
wrote a book called miles to go on which
he says it takes twenty five years

615
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,940
to make changes are the political
science literature says it takes six

616
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,700
years to make

617
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,960
changes in a in a in a corporate
organization that wants to make the

618
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,720
change

619
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,500
I think if you add secrecy and too much
money to that it takes it up to 18

620
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,410
are and then if you had the federal
government to that it takes about 225

621
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,370
storm or less at the same number

622
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,650
are it's gonna be another 10 years but
when I think we're starting to see now

623
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,010
is I i've helped 40 governments
worldwide create open source

624
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,700
intelligence facilities and capabilities
mostly inside the military some in law

625
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,680
enforcement

626
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,890
my partner much for sure is helping
businesses worldwide

627
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,609
improve their business intelligence and
what I see coming down the pike here in

628
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,070
the next five years

629
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:10,160
is an explosion in on-demand tailored
intelligence

630
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,279
using legal open sources and methods
arms excited by this

631
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,710
so barring any specific training
agencies then what sorta

632
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,710
general paths would you say in terms of

633
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,870
from a clear absolutely does not hurt
you to join the US military as a

634
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,900
civilian or uniform person

635
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,570
are and learn the process have
intelligence for all its flaws it's a

636
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,100
good starting point

637
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,580
are and then migrate that out and and
you should have a lot of fun with

638
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,500
intelligence careers dot com

639
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,290
just look at all the jobs that are going
begging right now on get any one of them

640
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,090
and intelligence careers dot com and
thank you visit a hack

641
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:51,410
you know and I mean some guys came up to
thank me for telling them in nineteen

642
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:55,020
94 to get a haircut learn how to worsen
on

643
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,870
because these jobs can be had I mean
you're not far by the way your t-shirt

644
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,569
reminds me I I encourage the US
government to send a bunch of people

645
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,230
here in 1994

646
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,540
and I was particularly amused by the
team's the two-man teams

647
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,940
with closely cropped hair white t-shirt
shorts and black or fan shoes

648
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,550
that was Air Force intelligence at the
time I think they've improved since then

649
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,800
all right sir your question are you
there mention nature while ago

650
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,950
need for a national traitor
intelligences

651
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,040
with on that subject with what's your
take on the

652
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,100
all Valerie Plame outing an

653
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,509
who do you think did it I think Scooter
Libby and Dick Cheney's office did it

654
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,740
with Collaros explicit approval and Dick
Cheney's explicit concealment after the

655
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,910
fact

656
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:43,120
arm what are your feelings on it

657
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:49,109
hits it has the potential to be al
capone's tax return

658
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,620
really does she think it is the
celebrity where do you think

659
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,910
investigational E

660
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,140
well regardless of who's found have the
hardest part of our problem is that the

661
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,400
republicans

662
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,250
control both houses of Congress and the
moderate republicans are being

663
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,890
intimidated by the extremist republicans

664
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,040
arm at the people haven't spoken

665
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,900
right now the people don't care about
Valerie Plame's outing

666
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,580
arm inasmuch as the vice president's
office in my humble opinion

667
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,259
very flagrantly into liberally violate
international law

668
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,190
I'd like to see them brought to justice

669
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,550
I would like to see dick cheney brought
to justice for sole sourcing

670
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,410
billions of dollars to help Burton

671
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,950
you know these guys are bending or
breaking every rule they can find

672
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,440
and the outing a Valerie poem i think is

673
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,410
is one of the things that george tenet
simply had be honest about

674
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,620
and it led to his eventual resignation

675
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,880
but it's al capone's tax return my
opinion

676
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,710
thank you I think my I think cheney's
history I think Road decided that about

677
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,820
six months ago

678
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,480
and now the only question is whether
it's cool yanni or

679
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,720
mom I don't think it'll be colin powell
its cool yanni I don't think it'll be

680
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,390
McCain a single guy on the right now in
my opinion

681
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:12,390
is the front-runner for a mindless
ticket

682
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,330
what's at torture doesn't work

683
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,009
a torturous farm boy schoolboy stuff a

684
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:26,510
are that prison was grossly mismanaged
a/c part of the problem with iraq

685
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:30,440
I hate to say this but after the
bathroom again on

686
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,800
see I have a small plot maestro and if I
don't keep constantly lubricated it

687
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,030
starts to collapse on itself and tickles
and I start to choke

688
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,220
and sold one of the aspects of my life
that is constant is

689
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,980
imbibing normally water but lotsa fluids

690
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:51,540
now arm more worried because I wanted
200 torture

691
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,009
look rumsfeld screw the US government

692
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,910
he screwed the american public big is he
first of

693
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,990
chill lobby I think was an Iranian agent
of influence

694
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:06,500
and the Iranians are laughing their
heads off because they pulled off the

695
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,560
best strategic deception

696
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,580
in our history they got 6

697
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,690
really ignorant people to believe to
lobby who had already been fired by CIA

698
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,790
as a thief and a liar okay and Shalabi
basically

699
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:23,220
when you're feeding false information
you feel what they want to hear

700
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,350
as such a lobby fed these morons the the

701
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,500
I hearts and flowers and and and flowers
in the street and smiles liberation all

702
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,050
that

703
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,890
so Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz were deceived

704
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,839
into thinking that a rock could be a
cakewalk and that we could do it like

705
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,170
with precision munitions in limited
numbers a ground troops

706
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:46,680
the military professionals told him in
no uncertain terms that we needed

707
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,140
massive a is actually a standard number
for an occupation army

708
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,520
and make no mistake about it this was an
occupation army but it wasn't

709
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,580
created as an occupation army wasn't
staffed up

710
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,450
so having gone and and and beat the crap
out of them we were then left

711
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,360
literally naked an empty and so Rumsfeld
and had to make

712
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,050
up for that with a massive influx
reservists

713
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:13,690
who are not trained equipped an
organized actually be an occupying army

714
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,000
we broke the social contract with the
National Guard

715
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,920
I mean the deal with the National Guard
is is weekends two weeks and

716
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,940
you know once every 15 years you replace
a body bag are but

717
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,780
we broke the social contract with them
and so what Rumsfeld has done is put a

718
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,750
whole bunch of

719
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,650
untrained contractors in untrained
reservists

720
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,860
in place in the military professionals a
by the way clinton cut

721
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:44,960
okay the peace dividend actually gutted
the Pentagon on the human side

722
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,210
and Rumsfeld at the same time did not
fix the human shortfalls when he had his

723
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:49,910
chance

724
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,160
he chose instead to spend seventy
billion dollars and weapon systems he

725
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,060
still hasn't find

726
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,630
are possibly other seven billion on on
missile defense which is a bullet

727
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,370
hitting the ball in the sky

728
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,580
okay any gonna happen arm

729
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:08,350
I mean these guys are morons are in in
practical thoughtful terms but they have

730
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,670
some ideological worldview sitter just

731
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,980
utterly amazing and Shalabi literally

732
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,360
suck to send to that war up because the

733
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,240
White House chose to turn off the
diplomatic professionals intelligence

734
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,370
professionals even as ignorant as they
were

735
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,560
the intelligence professionals at
serious reservations about this

736
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,370
and the white house basically turned off
the military the diplomats the

737
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,270
professionals

738
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:34,620
the media when on this this witch hunt
are questioning the war was was

739
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,330
unpatriotic

740
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:40,630
and the stupid American public bought it
and congress pod

741
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,180
and a lot of us were trying to say hey
wait a minute you know i mean fully paid

742
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,759
in full as you look at my record on my
website saying this is nuts

743
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,810
arm this terrible anyway torture doesn't
work I'll tell you which one here

744
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:57,130
yes sir hi I'd like to ask we've talked
about the system

745
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,300
which we would use to catalog
observations and I items

746
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,400
intelligence from open sources and I'd
like to see if you could elaborate just

747
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,150
a little more

748
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,890
on whether what what items and
information we could tag

749
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,100
to those observations with to make the
system useful

750
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,500
in what ways weaker search and index

751
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,060
I am that data so

752
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,680
how how would that be designed I don't I
don't I don't have that system

753
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,109
I don't have any of the final technical
answers other than the say that at a

754
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,090
minimum we should be doing XML RSS
compliant

755
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:34,150
staff it should have a date and time tag
as well as a geospatial tag

756
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:37,920
it should have attributes for who
collected it who validated it for

757
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,900
posting

758
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:43,600
are if it's translated information it
should have a direct link back to the

759
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,570
original

760
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:50,380
arm and I think over time this will work
itself out

761
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,360
I'm gonna have to stop and go to the
bathroom I promise you three guys that

762
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,240
it'll take no more than five minutes and
when i come back

763
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,400
I'll answer your questions can the staff
handled pins again

764
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:08,400
and then I'll BRB right back please
don't take one if you've already taken

765
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:18,240
superbly more than that how frequent and
what methods you think I used by their

766
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,450
handlers to make sure that they're

767
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:25,770
agents are still around in ready to go
and would you see the have weapons now

768
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,770
stored in the united states and with
purpose ill at ease

769
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,820
with you yes that they are stored in
that's that's a little broad for me to

770
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,520
give you

771
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,550
really definitive answer but

772
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,880
I would say that like the

773
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,910
well first off they come into the
country so easy i mean one of the 19

774
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,430
hijackers are

775
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,899
I can remember all the details but will
I think I show up without a visa without

776
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,210
a passport saying that they need asylum

777
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,900
were interviewing them and letting them
out on the street never to be seen again

778
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,080
arm you know we don't have real security
here in the United States

779
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,590
we're very naive and I think our
regulations

780
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:12,990
are I i mean I for me it's simple you
want to visit the United States your

781
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,320
guest you need a police check from your
home country

782
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,240
and have enough love you end up being
bad boys we close the border to that

783
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:19,820
country

784
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,510
are for me this is not hard are

785
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,120
obviously there a lot of politicians are
a lot a corrupt deals going on

786
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,500
there's an enormous amount of saudi
money being channel two every US

787
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,510
Congressman

788
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,620
and political figure consequence arm

789
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,620
me Bush george bush doesn't hold hands
with just about

790
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,819
everybody the only holds hands with
Saudi princes

791
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:46,480
and the occasional Chinese tennis player
coach I'm told I'm told by the Dutch by

792
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,000
the way a completely sober

793
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,580
Dutch intelligence officer Tommy the
chinese have pictures arm

794
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,410
they got young George so drunk when he
was a teenager in his father's house in

795
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,040
Beijing

796
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,860
that I think they got compromising
pictures whether he was actually

797
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,880
homosexual engaged or not it looks like

798
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,550
I don't know if this is true or not but
this is what a sober Dutch intelligence

799
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:07,800
officer told me

800
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:13,080
cell latest share this I will also
mention to you that John Kerry and

801
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,310
others have been talking about bush's

802
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,779
hanging out with a notorious black track
Queen at Harvard

803
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,160
and when Carrie says he knows bush I
think he knows bush

804
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,109
in terms of drugs alcohol in drag queens
a

805
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:32,100
so cell whatever I don't know what the
truth is what I think book

806
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,210
Bush is a walking lie I mean I think his
face

807
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:39,710
is false his mind is shallow

808
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:44,240
arm his heart is actually much more
vicious and evil

809
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,120
than people realize on and I think he is
starting to become mentally unbalanced

810
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,190
and there are reports starting to emerge
now on congressional

811
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:57,800
newspapers about his staff being
terrified the bushes gonna lose

812
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,470
before the election offer me the ideal
thing would be mccain

813
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,710
not cool yani is vice president bush
goes nuts in January

814
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:08,460
but we'll see yes sir

815
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,140
so we're what is a gay libertarian
computer scientist do to get into the

816
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,859
talented

817
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,640
sector pretend to be a Pakistani

818
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,750
are I've got the beard

819
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,750
pay no slight you can do it because they
don't speak Arabic

820
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:28,030
okay sir just pretend to be an educated
Pakistani was really good gouge

821
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:31,030
the E you know I

822
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,880
the libertarians not an obstacle
actually the gay is an obstacle either

823
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,250
arm as long as you're declared gain can
be

824
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,820
the be blackmailed these days I think
they're relaxing that too

825
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:49,020
arm where most people lose it is on
habitual use a strong drugs

826
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,870
and if that's not an issue for you I
encourage you to apply

827
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,020
ball so it is alright what's at also to
that's okay

828
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:03,020
all the way to jolt alright now you
wearing panties are under pants

829
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,480
I

830
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,850
you know that's what bill clinton
shoulda said

831
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:15,940
I which happens to be my answer also

832
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,420
go ahead personal thank you for coming
out

833
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,840
I was my pleasure you mentioned that you
helped create

834
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,150
open source intelligence multiple right

835
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,600
countries I'll want to

836
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:36,120
more information you well i've I'd at
kinda started to forget the list but

837
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:40,450
but basically what I do is I go in and I
lecture and i cant allies

838
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,580
and then they throw me out of the
country in and do stuff and don't tell

839
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,529
me about it

840
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:48,240
arm but among the best are

841
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,310
are the Swedish I didn't help the
norwegians they did it on their own and

842
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,310
everyone respects them enormously

843
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,900
the British military screwed up the
australians have 30 cents enters

844
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,920
a military law enforcement and one other
arm

845
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,230
and so basically I've just been going
around since 1992

846
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:09,510
when I hosted this contract rain over
7,000 people

847
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,880
and indirectly probably another 21,000

848
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,490
arm and in fact one of my favorite
photos in my office is a Ukrainian

849
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:21,580
military officer standing next to a
computer which has my website on it

850
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:24,590
are wanna my state department running
buddies

851
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:29,400
was in the Ukraine and they brought him
in as a diplomat and they said this is

852
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,630
what we use open source is

853
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:35,160
and it was my website and so he took a
picture and gave it to me in

854
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,580
I've been told that I've influence
people around the world I have no clue

855
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:44,490
exist arm part of the problem is that
the conventional bureaucracies

856
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:48,060
in all these countries are fighting open
source intelligence

857
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:51,480
like real man a real spies don't do open
source intelligence

858
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,140
I was having a ok sam i clandestine
meeting in France with the colonel in

859
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:58,830
charge of french open source
intelligence for general Heinrich

860
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,940
I've spoken in the French Senate twice
arm

861
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,470
and arm he said to me mister still I
can't get on the take open source here

862
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:07,950
says

863
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,040
lookers were gonna deal we're gonna have
a cover sheet

864
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,509
code word Oscar Sierra and its gonna
have super top secret and more color

865
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,840
code hashes for compartment things and
we're gonna

866
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,510
announce that only the top 10 people in
France can read the special new code

867
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:23,680
word

868
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,410
and the kernel look to me since mister
steal it's a very French solution

869
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,930
so you know we have our obstacles I
actually feel closer to my KGB

870
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,400
counterparts and I do to the FBI or to
the white house

871
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,760
anybody else in the US government
intelligence professionals around the

872
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,360
world are very similar

873
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:45,070
in many ways have similar mindset some
culture some latitudes a similar

874
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:48,920
obstacles to reform

875
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,790
questions recently talk

876
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,810
Saudi investment in the United States

877
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:00,759
the role it's playing ripe for
nationalization

878
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,700
arm I would never let bin Laden's
relatives get outta town that to me was

879
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:11,700
an absolutely corrupt act

880
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,470
there's the there's a friendly
white-collar prison in Connecticut that

881
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,590
I would have asked them all

882
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,720
stay a a couple weeks arm

883
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,290
or should the plane down so sorry on

884
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,330
Minami what better target as long as
they're all their

885
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,750
arm the

886
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,890
not forget your question again I want

887
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:39,290
find general your

888
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,529
you all men's on money that is

889
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:48,730
mister

890
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,810
I think the US has prostituted itself

891
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:56,650
in multiple ways you know Robert Pierce
books for the best on this and he ends

892
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,370
his book sleeping with the Dell

893
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:02,580
he ends his book sleeping with the Dell
talking about the saudi corruption

894
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,680
America

895
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,120
he says america is lying there on the
bed with her legs spread

896
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,560
looking at the saudi wallet on the
bureau

897
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,690
great weight and the book came we've
sold out we've lost our integrity

898
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,110
and we've lost her integrity because our
citizens allow are allowing politicians

899
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:23,100
to make decisions based on money rather
than intelligence

900
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,150
you know this is real simple you know we
have to take back this government or

901
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:32,430
were scurred it's that simple on and
unfortunately John Kerry doesn't seem to

902
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,370
get it

903
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:37,980
arm I mean I think because he knows bush
so well from Harvard

904
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,160
I think he's delusional and i also think

905
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,759
that the republicans are willing to use
everything including assassination

906
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,750
to keep our I'm serious arm

907
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:54,890
I believe that the republicans have
violated the laws in the past

908
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:59,040
the head of the electronic voting
company has told bush publicly at a

909
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,509
fundraiser that he guarantees bush will
win the election

910
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:06,610
arm that may or may not have been partly
in jest but this whole

911
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,970
electronic voting thing as a mass arm

912
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:15,110
I believe that if its democratic base
against Republican base the republicans

913
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,370
when

914
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,390
and John Kerry has one shot at winning

915
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:23,190
and that's by being a dog catcher in
making electoral reform the number one

916
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,950
issue and by announcing a coalition
cabinet

917
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:32,950
in advance and we're creating a new post
for jello our minister of culture

918
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:38,500
thank you

919
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,090
thank this person's a little off the
wall but it was not good yes up

920
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,590
with the collapse of the Soviet Union
what happened to the numerous

921
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,410
a sleeper agents there were no doubt
present the United States

922
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:53,390
don't underestimate the competence in
the soviet KGB

923
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,150
on in fact oleg kalugin who is a retired

924
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:00,680
a KGB officer in charge to the first
director

925
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,680
has written a book arm and he was also
elected to the Republican parliament

926
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,380
and one other point see made was that he
was using open source intelligence as a

927
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,470
substitute free agent recruitments

928
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:14,610
are by and large I think the Soviets
were largely ineffective

929
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:18,580
now where they may have had some some
success was with immigrants

930
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:23,940
and and and people like that arm but you
know what the problem was spying is you

931
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,240
actually have to know what you're
looking for

932
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,380
and you have to have access to what it
is you're looking for you have to be

933
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,610
able to take it back and make sense of
it

934
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,790
it's a lot easy to make sense in the
world if you get your act together an

935
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,670
open source is first

936
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:40,520
you know and then do very selective
clandestine stuff

937
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,300
on

938
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,540
I E ID don't know I'll

939
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,870
if the soviet has soviets have many
sleepers they probably have some around

940
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:54,319
the National Labs and things like that

941
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,290
but by and large I think they're
focusing more on domestic internal

942
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,490
security

943
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:04,880
and and eliminating the Tartarus in the
chechnyans

944
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,870
than they are on us a friend once the
rise to me that

945
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:12,450
to that since the soviet union is no
doubt had the technology to build things

946
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,600
like suitcase nukes

947
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:18,110
for many years I'll where the chances
that the soviet operatives were present

948
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:18,440
in the

949
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,580
were present in the United States for
yes and longer time during the nineteen

950
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,500
eighties

951
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:27,420
and with sex with I would say very very
very high

952
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:33,250
and two-thirds of the 100 suitcase nukes
are unaccounted for according to soviet

953
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,010
major-general

954
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:38,270
where's that information available I
can't remember it's in one of the many

955
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,380
books I've read

956
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:42,600
arm but two-thirds of the soviet nuclear
bombs

957
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,820
are unaccounted for according to the
soviets

958
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,760
thank you my pleasure yes sir i by the
way I expect one will go often

959
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,870
in Australia are at the same time that
bin Laden hijacks a Pakistani nuclear

960
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:59,600
arms southern takes out the brain
headquarters

961
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,300
have a nice day okay I have a

962
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,670
the spy story questions hopefully do the

963
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,930
fun stuff are possible there was a

964
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:13,140
book out last year about

965
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:17,629
us by I believe you name John O'Neill
the book was a

966
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:21,390
if I remember correctly up the man who
won America

967
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:26,620
in that the are it mentioned that the

968
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,680
I american spies who are going on a
foreign land

969
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,770
depend upon American foreign embassies &

970
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,100
I diameter or their are for the security
and information

971
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:41,990
bad but that they had there have been
cases where does foreign ambassadors

972
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:47,090
in the name all well maintaining for in
a relationship that have a

973
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:50,960
been an obstacle I to the spice

974
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,310
I where working on the bar and then

975
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:58,460
I want to know about the if you have had
any such encounters

976
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:03,550
its it's a two-way street are we have
some politically appointed morons as

977
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,870
ambassadors

978
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,799
all who don't appreciate the few
positive things

979
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,550
spying can do but we also have some

980
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:16,050
very arrogant ignorant chiefs have
station

981
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:19,560
who deceive and manipulate ambassadors
arm

982
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,759
it's all human nature I think we can
dramatically improve our foreign service

983
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,270
by dramatically increasing their money
and their numbers

984
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:30,000
one of the problems we've had as we've
eliminated all the secretaries and

985
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,890
embassies

986
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:35,310
sold the junior foreign service officers
now a very expensive secretary

987
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:40,080
arm the whole system is broken arm I
would like to have a university over

988
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,970
Republic

989
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:44,570
the University of the Republic where all
seven tribes

990
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:47,840
send their best and the brightest to
train at the entry made management

991
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,810
and CEO level and I would like to have
interagency training classes

992
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:58,110
soul that a for any given country let's
say so done once a year

993
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:01,830
there is a conference in an ongoing
continuing education for every person

994
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,890
the US government touching sued on

995
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:07,180
on the all come together and they
actually walk away with a roster of

996
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,940
who's doing what and Sue done

997
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,020
and then you can extend that to have a
more select group that does the seven

998
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:12,830
tribes

999
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:16,770
so for example the European conflict
prevent ECC p

1000
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:20,060
European something conflict prevention

1001
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,390
are is now starting to produce
guidebooks

1002
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,540
to all of the NGO programs country by
country

1003
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,300
are no one's ever done that before are
so we're getting there. the Internet is

1004
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,800
making a lot possible one more question
very quickly not three

1005
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,660
okay are tell us I
