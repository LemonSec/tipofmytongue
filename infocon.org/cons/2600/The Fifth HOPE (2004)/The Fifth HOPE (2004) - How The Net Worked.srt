1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,640
sitting there I C

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,730
and helps appear on stage

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:20,730
better these guys have slapped a

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:27,740
how many hours a sleepyhead cancer

5
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,490
trickle

6
00:00:54,370 --> 00:01:01,370
up

7
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:16,700
him

8
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:28,020
up that's great

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,750
makers well arm we have pretty much your
the arc or people involved with the

10
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,560
network which would have been possible
without all the volunteers

11
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,810
and all we're going to a recap of how
the network worked

12
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,399
well parts of it didn't work an arm our
problems have had in the past phones we

13
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,490
solve this time in

14
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,770
problems we think we still had this
conference sela

15
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,590
the network team is a Adam prado whose d

16
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,039
lead evolved networking are at Hope are

17
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,310
said Hardy was in charge of all the
network staff

18
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,770
in the NOC this year who kept it running
arm I was in charge the wireless

19
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,720
and Mike at the end there I'm sorry Mike
at the end there was in charge of the

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,910
public %uh McCluster

21
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,989
and Adam will talk about some the
problems we had in past years

22
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,480
so now

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,440
well talk about is really are gonna be
in the perspective of what happened

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,829
since

25
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,400
h2k through it I for of the fifth holds

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,850
although i 10 and dad hope in ninety
four I was not part the staff and our

27
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,959
said in a 10-yard hope so on my
perspective I goes back to

28
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,920
happening around age two games 21st you
bad involved in

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,850
in helping the organization and the
whole conference so

30
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:50,230
I am hopefully everybody remembers when
probably a lot people who were here for

31
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,790
that

32
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,190
conference and if people recall all we
had was the 18th floor

33
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,280
where where we're sitting was not I used
speakers it was used only as the a

34
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,040
network room

35
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,010
einon's on I believe the link speaking
rooms we had were

36
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,209
I what it was at Pinetop I'm never up
even if you remember the court

37
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,560
our sky cop in Pinetop okay in Madison
cell

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,980
are those in speaking rooms and then the
Poulter McCluster was

39
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,459
in the Madison room not mistaken yep

40
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,160
so I the east the scallop the network
was

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,230
significantly smaller and significantly
easier

42
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,440
I believe I we had everything set up in
like three or four hours

43
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,060
and when it came time for the collapsing
everything at the end of the conference

44
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,049
and he goes out here by 9pm I we did
that doesn't mean we didn't have any

45
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,600
problems %uh for instance

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,370
I Wireless was a complete after thought
we didn't even consider it

47
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,799
Andain I'll drop congress was nice
enough to go out to

48
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,900
like Radio Shack or American Compu same
purchase to admire

49
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,790
airport on Apple Airport sadistic them
up so there are some people

50
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,940
to get onto the wireless network on also
since the scales a small object is only

51
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,880
a team like maybe nine people

52
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,840
the the core network organizes word me
only people doing anything there was no

53
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,459
Micah by real teams is just us setting
up a network

54
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:15,239
on now people might remember that no we
had a problem with horizon where

55
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,320
we can get the eighty ones up until
about 5 p.m. on Friday which is much

56
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,459
after the a conference start but

57
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,720
once they were up you know people
rejoiced and

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,970
appear on the network so on we had a
couple hiccups on the

59
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,509
actual router easing in me on at: stock
OpenBSD machine which just cannot handle

60
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,889
the load up just a small network over
here so

61
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:41,560
midweek got the conference getting
rebuild OpenBSD

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,850
but the enemy clusters select actually I
have enough

63
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,500
done kernel memory to handle packet
switching so

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,460
me it meant to do that a couple times we
found the magic number which is about

65
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,520
16,000

66
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,770
which was able to handle you have to
keep the network movement

67
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,880
that happened about Saturday and then I
don't do any major events the network

68
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,889
for the rest remainder the conference so
I think the

69
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,250
network reach UK was actually in a pre
mom

70
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,380
pretty reasonably solid although much
smaller in scale

71
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,909
so fast-forward to 2002

72
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,530
when we had set up the and hope that the
the conference

73
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,919
I manuals arm him

74
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,919
thought that would happen after now that
we can just buy the expensive getting

75
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,139
now only the 18th floor but also the
second floor which you had recently be

76
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,669
gottman transform from Sports Authority
which makes see this more to come in

77
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:32,340
still

78
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,289
lining the walls of the escalators
itself you know into

79
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,310
but now the the convention center and
fifth and million

80
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,030
and I that was we seriously
underestimated how much work was gonna

81
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,930
be involved in that

82
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,889
are there was a lot of problems number
one we didn't actually do a lot of

83
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,229
preparing on the networks I could be
taken for granted that

84
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:54,719
things went so easily last time this
could be you know just more the same

85
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:55,120
I'll

86
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,289
unfortunately it wasn't are getting the
fiber between to any team was just on

87
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,310
it just nightmare I think a we broke

88
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,479
nine out of 12 the the pair's

89
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,508
you a fiber luckily we had enough chairs
and get to an 80 connected

90
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,919
on and images the wireless network was
awesome

91
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,060
again an afterthought me to start at
levi PTC eyes burn up some

92
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,599
alexis is we just drove them around the
network and

93
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,810
guy I don't know how much configuration
actually when in standby

94
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,319
you know other wireless I think it's a
sadist you're 18 really

95
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,860
on for work unfortunately on a lot
people blames the fact that we only had

96
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,990
two T wants to the Internet i hope i

97
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,719
after the show some stats that that
we've will the spill

98
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:41,719
dispel that rumor because want people
complaining

99
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,580
this time around that we didn't have
enough and with to the unit would only

100
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,870
team lines

101
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,779
last time at the same at a band with
people attribute its loan issue that

102
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:49,529
one's actually

103
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:53,699
the wireless networks wired networks and
on burkina pretty much time

104
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,199
on when a major problems we had hope to
data its UK to

105
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,669
was dis management's we had

106
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,870
this mammoth undertaking a both a and
second floors

107
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,029
and on we had this just about the same
number volunteers as last time

108
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,949
and I I try to manage both the
volunteers and the network and that just

109
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:14,370
a

110
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,770
I was just a complete failure on when it
came down to the time the conference

111
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,808
I had me note about twenty people who
were volunteering to handle

112
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:28,009
the NOC staff and I think I am I didn't
get any of them

113
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:31,629
and the only people I actually had with
people who helped out the conference

114
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:32,830
last time around

115
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,878
so I didn't actually sleep I was snapped
conference from maybe

116
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,870
7 p.m. till 7 a.m. for the three days
and had one person here

117
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,979
taking the seven and seven PM shifts and
it was just a way too much

118
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:48,210
you know I think its annual conferences
you know how to not make sure everything

119
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,169
was running

120
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,508
arm so the obviously there are a lot of
problems we had in

121
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:57,659
in in planning everything I'll the
locally the only problem we didn't have

122
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,419
was rise in the morning tea once

123
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:04,058
a month early and just but the the
internet was up before I even got some

124
00:08:04,059 --> 00:08:05,439
conference iMac

125
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,809
an act on it came over and set up t want
and everything's working when I got

126
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:09,449
there

127
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,539
on bites everything else was just a

128
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,389
desde it wasn't as amid pack I was
miserable experience but as a lot of fun

129
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:16,839
amino

130
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:20,129
meant a lot of good people and is fine
work with people under such

131
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:23,589
our enormous man stress but the
conference itself has moved in and near

132
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:24,889
was on fun for us

133
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,360
so this time around on we about

134
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,349
the never team and I am me dis planned
out be actually did some

135
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:35,880
you know for planning and majorie
understood we were getting into before

136
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,029
we got into it and I think

137
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,049
as you'll see after we finish speaking
on the

138
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,339
network was a very good success at least
in my opinion hopefully a lot of your

139
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:46,080
opinions

140
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,180
so my guests wish to stop start talking
about the planning

141
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,700
that one involved in this year's a
conference cell

142
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,370
on this time around among other things
that I

143
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,880
made sure I have and unfortunately for
Seth

144
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,310
on he added responsibility for handling
all

145
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,660
love the NOC last NOC staff managing
volunteers

146
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,510
and I think he can attest to what you
know when a difficult otherwise

147
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,950
are we do we did have a lot of really
good people in the NOC this time and

148
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,490
that's really a testament to

149
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,960
South he made sure that we got another
people enough people can actually trust

150
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,279
are we didn't have any jerks trying to
get into the NOC and I

151
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,589
you start you know tinkering around
South tell you know a sabotage we'll be

152
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:30,060
had

153
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,180
which is my biggest fear because I've
had such a bad you know hands-off

154
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,250
approach to

155
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,339
the Knox death but he did really I past
and in job getting us some good people

156
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,220
good it's very good very smart people
arm ends and acetyl talk more about that

157
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,779
on one hand it over to him I I guess on

158
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,839
on the on the core network side I

159
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,630
we actually up set up the machines ahead
of time

160
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,760
as was sitting at the cheese at the
conference so we had pretty much

161
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,120
everything ready to go

162
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,410
on when we started setting up the
network at 5 p.m. on actually at 4 p.m.

163
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:08,469
on on Thursday the network is actually
up by 5 p.m. on its use by everything in

164
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,260
turn them on and was ready to go so
unfortunate have 30 ones in place but

165
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
you know that's

166
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,790
compare another story will have to will
get into later on

167
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,870
I am I think the ike a cell

168
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,260
I guess now handed over to south now to
and tell what he might have done

169
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,069
for the eye doc staff so it all started
when there is one in the

170
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,190
fifth help volunteer meetings city

171
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,860
and there was talk about how in previous
years there around

172
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,590
time people on knock staff and I made a
mistake I'm opening my mouth going

173
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,710
I can get you coverage weekend and right
after I said

174
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,870
Mike I'm scurred described myself

175
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,950
and immediately people like if you can
do that

176
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,030
do it you're in charge in my car now on
if i dont

177
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,430
I got maybe thirty five forty people for
NoC staff

178
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,640
over the next few months mostly because
I know about half of them are gonna be

179
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,220
scum bags and not show up

180
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,820
it wasn't actually that bad a lot of
people showed up

181
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,950
there were people there at all times I i
think we had enough

182
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,380
really good people there who weren't
just showing up for their shifts

183
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,150
but they actually wanted to help out an
assist in every way that they could

184
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,920
because they enjoy that sort of thing
they wanted to see the network

185
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,329
work properly they wanted to help
everybody else out

186
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,950
so we had a lot of people who are just
hanging out in the NOC for

187
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,480
a good portion of the conference because
it's what they wanted to do

188
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,630
so we had a whole bunch people their
help in our when

189
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,000
people who weren't has committed didn't
show

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,080
it wasn't as much of a problem by

191
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,440
it turned out really really well was a
lot better than I was actually expecting

192
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,000
I was sort of worried that I was getting
at the 4 a.m. phone calls

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,030
saying hey nobody showed up for their
shift are you have to come and cover

194
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,910
so that didn't really happen everything
went really well

195
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,020
and really it's the volunteers who

196
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,250
signed up and then spent most of their
time at the conference

197
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,100
in the NOC doing work honey made a pain
to get in

198
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,280
and rather than go do all the things
that

199
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,600
a badge that you paid for it give you
the privilege to do

200
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,340
rather than do that they decided that
they would put in their time and their

201
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,580
effort and their energy and their money
even to

202
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,640
getting everything up and running and
keeping it running

203
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,189
even if it meant missing out on talks
even if it meant missing out on sleep

204
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,830
a lot of us really didn't sleep much has
he comprised how

205
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,030
arm by the these people are really the
ones

206
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,380
who deserve the credit for that the
staffing stuff Nami

207
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,400
because I just got show up and the
people who wanted to be there remain

208
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,820
there

209
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,820
hands after that %ah

210
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,690
I guess that's really all I have to say
about the staff

211
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,150
eyes are any questions by will do the
Q&A part

212
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:10,650
at the end where we actually a
unfortunately we banged out this summer

213
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,310
panel about on I guess forty-five
minutes ago

214
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,240
2004 wasn't south and Mike unfortunate
weren't there so we actually have a lot

215
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,130
more than that I would actually does
talk about

216
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,280
afternoon talk about the planning to
know how to implement it shows the

217
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,870
Saints network statistics Batman within
South

218
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,910
and I them talk about what the problems
were and then we'll go to Q&A

219
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:34,089
cell makes arguments about how the
wireless was up land

220
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,590
right arm in the past as adam said are
the world's was mostly consumer

221
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,730
equipment which

222
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,440
is pretty easy to make fall down are
this time we tried to plan it so that

223
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,160
are

224
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,780
well basically there's no way you can
keep people from breaking the wireless

225
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,730
because it's a broadcast carrier and
summers gonna transmit make it fall down

226
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,830
all we can do is make it hard for them
and make it so that the system or cover

227
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,410
itself

228
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,719
arm as much as possible from someone
doing that and for large part were

229
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,520
fairly successful with that this year

230
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,230
arm a couple people decided to screw the
network who were moderately successful

231
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,740
at it unfortunately

232
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,570
but for the most part stayed up ok we
used custom

233
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,160
harbor that we were borrowing from the
mesh AX people in Boston

234
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,490
who are part of the roof net community
networks and I am

235
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,050
we use that some custom software
management manager

236
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,400
a host AP underway next to run the
access points themselves

237
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,150
a high-powered radios and a lot of
coverage to try to

238
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,090
defeat people messing with the network
arm if you look up there actually

239
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,680
on the curtains on how many noticed them
actually during the con

240
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,090
that's for the access points live for
this room arm

241
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,220
%uh planning was about two months in

242
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,390
we gotta walk through early and its
radio testing

243
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,770
and actually mapped out the networks
this time and

244
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,520
I'll be releasing this offer to control
the networks after the conference

245
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,970
but I wasn't gonna give everyone a
chance to find my coding books

246
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,780
beforehand

247
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:08,780
but some had a question but we'll take
it at the end

248
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,640
I guess I couldn't really hear you and
will get people microphone after

249
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,699
so turned over to Mike to

250
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,390
talk about the PTC a bit yeah I'd like
to start of coming to the show

251
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,490
and how many people who have actually
used on a public terminals yeah

252
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,930
alright great on the public to cluster

253
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,570
a little bit weird because it's not
really part of the car 2600 experience

254
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:37,230
the hope organizers provider network in
expected to bring their own computer an

255
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,210
hour so

256
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,390
you know what if you don't have your own
computer and that sort of her waist up

257
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:41,830
in

258
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,150
know our problems we have is since we're
not really

259
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,930
hargrove or we don't get a budget
everything they have to do has to be

260
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,450
very very cheap this year

261
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,580
we get about 50 or so 46 is from

262
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,940
gone we got a lot of free monitors
that's what we have to work with

263
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,920
with tried to do those some antlers two
years ago

264
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,780
and it was really a complete disaster on
a man problems we had was a

265
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,920
without worlders gonna be all these
people in union of 7200 machines

266
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,600
and just bringing all those to the
conference trying to get them up and

267
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,120
running

268
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,570
really consumed most of our time um

269
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,180
this year we decided a

270
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,310
we're just not gonna do that we have a
16 to 20 things running on the second

271
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,530
floor and a couple more appear on the
first floor under

272
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,910
really that was enough a lot more people
do have laptops I'll

273
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,860
but at the same time I did see pretty
much people on the public terms almost

274
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,270
24/7

275
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,750
as well we got around some other
problems with the network

276
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,110
actually on Friday for a good bit late
afternoon the

277
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,010
Corti ones were down so we found someone
who donated us a little bit of world

278
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:54,860
steel online

279
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,960
they don't know that they donated a but
thank them anyway

280
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,990
so we're actually on line on the public
luster and everybody else

281
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,890
down which something we've never been
able to pull off before

282
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,550
um we've really have a lot more problems
on the network

283
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,200
itself those because an hour gonna have
to provide network connectivity

284
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,390
we have all the problems that they do
and then on top of that we have servers

285
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:17,830
enter

286
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,510
being attacked om the other
coconspirator markers summer an audience

287
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,010
there

288
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,000
said when he walked around pretty much
every time you saw at least one person

289
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,810
trying to do something to our server

290
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,389
and in the face for that I'm really
surprised how well it worked out other

291
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,940
we plan to have network connectivity on
all three floors

292
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,090
up was militia would be able to pull it
off

293
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,800
but woke up this morning and other
useful terminals on a

294
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,820
all three floors pretty happy about the

295
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,929
um another problem that I am planning as

296
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,540
I myself live in montana years ago and
hope for started

297
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,960
I lived in Pittsburgh and so that most
the other people involved now are spread

298
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,440
out between Montana and Seattle

299
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,890
and so on and the to the people that
helped out a lot

300
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,380
psyche and Adam didn't even meet until
Thursday

301
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,260
but were able to collaborate over the
Internet to get everything working

302
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,670
he brought some things I wrote from some
things and

303
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,920
when we got here at all kinda came
together really well

304
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,050
up because we only have 46 has to work
with obviously are not going be able to

305
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,470
run the modern my bros are directly on
them

306
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:33,410
so I recycle the concept those popular
in the mid 90's which is the thin client

307
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,590
the term on themselves all they do is
run the graphics and windowing system

308
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,899
that on any other applications in C++

309
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,870
all those were run on a one or two
servers during the comp

310
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,910
and the that worked out pretty well were
afraid the

311
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,160
our servers will get overloaded you need
a whole lot of them

312
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,750
but they actually managed to pull it off
really only one machine

313
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,060
miles on an outlaw 1900 so

314
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,280
not

315
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,110
the others were using

316
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,880
on another big problem had an edge to
pay to and

317
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,530
we have this time to that of course is
in havana network people are going to go

318
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,780
in and a

319
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,180
strewn with litter can announce
themselves default route and

320
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,220
do all kinds of horrible things so got
around that the survivor basically not

321
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,590
having internet

322
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,929
the machines up here are even out but
the ones on one and two are all talking

323
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,260
and only one person brother talking
device actually

324
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,580
Missouri a lot of people tried to plug
into how can figure out what

325
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,159
are getting internet signal token ring

326
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,410
with for Ethernet hubs on top so that he
could still bring your laptop and not

327
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,480
sat next to her friends we also

328
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,680
Omniture space on the tables for your
laptop

329
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,120
now one pretty well a big problem still
worth people yanking cables

330
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,700
all the time those probably the main
reason that machines are down

331
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,800
and short of coming here with steel
boxes to put everything on

332
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,810
after any much remember

333
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,909
'em really happy about but arias

334
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:10,360
think maybe next time I'm just gonna
bring a couple atari because

335
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,450
there so gratifying with saddam up on
Thursday pretty much from that point on

336
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,640
people are playing Atari

337
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,330
really nice

338
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,010
on month

339
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,750
but that's pretty much all I have on on
planning

340
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,710
so I am I guess we we actually a

341
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,930
covered a lot of the house
implementation during our a discussion

342
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:39,840
about the planning

343
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,520
but I'll just go to the more detail
about how other layout was

344
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,520
are track mines

345
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,740
yet what's the next guy try to use
Windows isn't this fun try one

346
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,120
in it explores on the internet stores
pain I'm

347
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,220
make that make them in a big alright so

348
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,380
I am that's a a topology map today a
drop in Vizio about the

349
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,750
network layout I it's a pretty
straightforward

350
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,580
we r organized armed groups in Sheen's I
you know into classes

351
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,280
public journal cluster was one class the
bring your own computer area was another

352
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,020
class

353
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,510
on there is a see the PTC was in their
own area whose

354
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,670
accusing class for the key mean to use
the word the UN

355
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,000
on but see we had not mean not be a man
for all the people who are actually

356
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,230
working on the network

357
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,090
I V I for the servers at work you're
running some the services I DNS TCP

358
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,510
patchy MySQL for some the internal

359
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,480
things that we were running ands at CNN
there is a management the UN where all

360
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,870
the EV equipment is

361
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,040
on and so on the other switches spur you
never management and

362
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,860
pulling down nine new SNP data for the
MTG graphs

363
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,360
so on all these were in a cat connected
to

364
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,370
a couple a farm the foundry and

365
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,810
foundry switches and get which model
that Adam

366
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:18,750
rothschild right which is Hannah also
handling our 218 fiber trunk

367
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,080
and on the machine it was handling all
the internal routing was a

368
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,429
I NetBSD machine that was built by

369
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:32,420
miles and myself I am house known you
were turned on the NOC staff abused at

370
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,300
NetBSD

371
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,800
because we you know comfortable with it
we only know it's Emily handle be lands

372
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,820
also had some on some protection built
into it

373
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,139
i believe i some the subnets lardner
subnets lower

374
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,600
to try to avoid some the network tricks
I guess we can get him up here later

375
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,090
if he's around 2i talk about what he
might have done their on

376
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,179
NN on your Mac provide I

377
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,080
network access card provided the IT team
wants to the Internet and I

378
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,210
Mets be really you know how was laid out

379
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,140
on I was running I P F on the router and
I know some people were complaining

380
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,890
though the network is little too
restrictive here

381
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,170
you guys are fascists in South on well
you know I

382
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,490
actually the network wasn't as
restrictive as you think we did allow

383
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,430
everything out

384
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,040
from the internal networks what we did
in allow our

385
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,330
was anything from you know private
address space because

386
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,669
you using private address space we need
to use it me too

387
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:32,530
you know as much from rooms we wanted
you guys to have access to the Internet

388
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,580
me needed to make sure things kept
running so

389
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,629
be pleaded to protect the infrastructure
from

390
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,450
you've met stuff but you know we didn't
mistreat you guys from your skin

391
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,750
port scanning the internet doing
anything you wanted to do on the

392
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,420
Internet just as long as it was traced
back to original

393
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,090
UN cracked IPA dress that's the only
restriction that was on the

394
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:54,159
no on the routing cell

395
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,230
I think that's about it my side

396
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,410
I actually leave only things I we're and
fiber

397
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,950
you know down the stairwell like we did
last time I we had a problem where are

398
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,840
we thought we miscalculated the length

399
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,699
on somebody thought it was a Tony
fifty-foot spoons actually too pretty

400
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:10,950
for

401
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,000
school so he got cut off halfway down on

402
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,680
and this is about I guess at midnight
when we found this out so now are

403
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,690
scrambling to get some

404
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,230
cabling for in some way to hook up our
other school

405
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,480
papyrus are somebody branches office got
these

406
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,030
SESC couplers be connected together take
it up

407
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,270
man cable dress the way bands Bobby had

408
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,870
to the eighteen connected on see

409
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,010
I guess these network appears Restrepo
is just a switch and Ling not the

410
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,800
the equipment sets around and the
wireless devices is not not nothing that

411
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,960
pretty special about the

412
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,590
network up here I guess that it from my
side

413
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,169
monahan says anything in particular
about that how you handle not staffing

414
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,950
wanna talk about

415
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,330
arm most latest model are yelling at
people when they didn't show up

416
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,939
people who are dedicated were there all
the time and they are absolutely

417
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,870
excellent

418
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,730
people who weren't were in this morning
as they weren't there

419
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,510
but we did enough planning in advance
and I got enough people who are

420
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,870
trustworthy that it wasn't an issue

421
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:15,960
on originalname wanted to have it be

422
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,760
three-hour shifts on

423
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,330
ended up being four-hour shifts on

424
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,580
everybody was given two shifts on they
weren't technically allowed to have

425
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,679
more than tale are so that people
wouldn't burn out

426
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,190
and not show up when they were supposed
to be there like the people

427
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,240
who were really involved spent a lot
more

428
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,050
man two shifts were in the NOC and
that's very very appreciated

429
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,760
army had three people officially on duty
at any given time

430
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,379
arm there were times when we had 15
people plus

431
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,550
in the NOC on actual park staff

432
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:58,210
we got some badges for the NOC staff and
actively kept everybody else how

433
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:02,370
so that people can get distracted so
that nobody would wonder and in steel

434
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,210
equipment

435
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,880
or break things are attached things that
they weren't supposed to touch

436
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,740
and that worked out really well arm our
physical location

437
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,190
on second floor was kind of hard to
secure

438
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,680
so we ended up grabbing things like
curtains tables and barricading the back

439
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,480
and trying to keep people out

440
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,830
and I was actually expecting of more
people to try to sneak their way and

441
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,550
now getting to the NOC because I'm not
allowed to be in there so I have to try

442
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,950
are we had we did have some bad but for
the most part it was actually pretty

443
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,910
good pretty

444
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,660
isolated from everybody else people were
actually able to do work

445
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,690
om we had some space in the back %ah

446
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:43,810
I brought a tent and there's little
pitch tent in the back

447
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:48,100
people slept in on because they didn't
want to use

448
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,840
they wanted to stay around the not so
they slept in a tent in the back

449
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,140
I'm p very dedicated people on

450
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,320
and they went well when a lot better
than I was expecting sour

451
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm very thankful for that

452
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,700
I have to say about it is

453
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,140
is miles out there you wanna come up and
talk about your post stuff

454
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,330
I one thing that we did before even
getting here was there was a lot

455
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,550
are our volunteer work on

456
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,450
in terms of setting the network up and
the design everything going on

457
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,690
at our apartment and on my remains miles
done a lot of work

458
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,060
on our place stuff sound he's on his way
up right now

459
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,570
by I definitely think that he should
have a chance to you

460
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:36,710
talk about it if you like if you like
because he put in

461
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,820
a lot of work into it and

462
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:46,220
yeah sound began Cocker

463
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,450
these useful I could do it

464
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,780
I love that one is up arm talks mattress
our

465
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,180
for the Euro

466
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,180
on the other Arbor something really get
a good test II don't think anyway

467
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:06,250
hammered on a and provably

468
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,900
reject any attacks in like compared to
the

469
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,950
pages and pages and blogs track as for
the higher

470
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,200
attacked but

471
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,930
the idea was that are two fingers really
simple people with you there are scooped

472
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,570
the Gateway

473
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,560
or the client and stuff that I did was

474
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,720
invisible to were no users

475
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,800
and it only protected against people
trying to are spoof

476
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,820
clients and convince the Gateway

477
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,000
to sending packets to the attackers
machine

478
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,580
rather than to actual client I'm

479
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,760
in order to prevent the more common
attack are sweeping the Gateway

480
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,020
individual user eating scene would have
to statically configured

481
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,170
the mac address the gateway into his
machine am

482
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,190
I don't know anybody did I do that
minuses I started getting

483
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,630
tax finances scans

484
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,640
for the hours

485
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,649
large transparent

486
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:14,330
right I'll mention some other lawyers in
the implementation are briefly before

487
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,600
Barack the actual hardware was a sigh
rick's media GX board which has been

488
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,809
made for about two years but the guys in
Boston managed to get their hands

489
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:25,649
on a couple dozen of them and it's a
neat little

490
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:30,169
eighty explored are that we crammed in a
prime star satellite distribution

491
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:34,869
box little grey box are down talked it
to prevent some overheating

492
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:39,279
a sub compact flash hard drive in it and
to 200 Millat radios

493
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,769
arm the soccer self was designed so that
they would all report to a central

494
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:45,299
controller that's down in the NOC

495
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:48,840
which would log all the attacks that
we're seeing are it would automatically

496
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,409
configure all channels

497
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:54,049
soften AP one away it would reconfigure
the rest of them to take advantage of

498
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:55,129
the available channels

499
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:58,489
a ran kismet on some of the access
points to

500
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:02,799
watch for people attacking the network
and it could also do

501
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,799
awesome active counterattacking cell

502
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:09,779
if someone brought up an access point
name the same as ours trying to spoof

503
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:10,359
ours

504
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,399
it would first flood all the users on
the fake access point loss that the

505
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,940
reattach the real axis point

506
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,259
our server reverse man in the middle and
then it would do

507
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,879
the able to live in a global nervous in
flood against the fake access point

508
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:24,809
until it fell down

509
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:29,590
arm we eventually turn that off because
they're so many people attacking the

510
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,899
access points at the air waves were just
so clogged

511
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:35,450
that it paid off more to let people get
stuck on the school

512
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,009
one sometimes then didn't contribute to
the congestion in the air

513
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:43,039
at one point we were running 1600 to
1700 packet a second

514
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,580
on one channel in the wireless which is

515
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,879
absolutely insane arm don't ever

516
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:56,879
hope to have kids sorry II after having
on the treadmill or radios in one room

517
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,519
at the same time on I've already given
up on that home

518
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:06,070
blame him I'll

519
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,158
cell that was pretty much our laurels
worked

520
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,460
%uh some AP's slapped around a bit a lot
of people tact them

521
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,249
are a big no boot to the head to the
people who mess that up for everyone

522
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:17,869
else but

523
00:31:17,869 --> 00:31:21,099
for the most part it seemed to be
holding up under the tax

524
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:24,200
are the implementation worked out pretty
well and

525
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,200
once I generic eyes the software bit are
like I said it'll be released

526
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,320
probably of the business side self
anyone's interested in how that worked

527
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,710
our

528
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,330
I'll be writing up a reading and posting
that probably in the next week or two

529
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,418
migrant on

530
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:41,609
yeah kinda covered a lot of my
implementation I guess

531
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:46,039
earlier a the one extra pieces what's
actually running on the

532
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:50,840
the forty-six themselves the Linux
distribution I made two years ago

533
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,499
for pitch to k2 it's very small

534
00:31:54,499 --> 00:31:57,509
the image itself 128 megs lie about this

535
00:31:57,509 --> 00:32:00,830
17 mags the stuff in the file system
itself

536
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,460
om and the the only account as a rhodes

537
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,999
few get into it at all nom analysts
what's gonna be there

538
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:12,279
tell a pretty well there's a really
glaring up there that I heard

539
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:16,149
which is that I left the bootloader
command line 11 people really getting

540
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:19,349
through that other manner think it held
up pretty well

541
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:23,820
our servers were just stock FreeBSD in a
Linux wanna

542
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,658
stars on on on gun the FreeBSD one on

543
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:32,529
so in other Linux offers two years old
it's been battle tested through to hold

544
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:36,659
conventions I'm pretty confident but
it's actually quite secure the spine

545
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:41,570
I

546
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,908
I guess that pretty much covered
everything 'em

547
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:48,960
now I guess he skipped something we had
another slide there that explain that

548
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,570
this

549
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,859
now up to the networks it is its area so
might can explain this

550
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:58,950
yeah sides Gary ordered slightly arm
this is the number of users connecting

551
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,320
to the access points

552
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,489
on each of the zones there's two primary
zones on the eighteenth floor

553
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:08,340
and one's own on the second floor so

554
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,659
this is pretty much over the duration of
the conference so

555
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:15,220
Eagle argues are this graph doesn't
reflect it as well

556
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,739
as the graphs will have in a minute
which are the numbers addresses we

557
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:20,029
handed out to unique

558
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:23,440
are mac Address is already cheap /a
which really reflect the

559
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,859
number views as we were seeing well

560
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:32,149
this is our MRTG graphs I think you
could see a a good spot a couple things

561
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:35,349
actually unfortunately it's three days
later so we can I noticed the time where

562
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:36,139
31

563
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,419
dirty ones were unavailable on now it's
compressed

564
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,240
you know to the weekly graph by on as
the seaweed

565
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,769
you're pretty much did he get he now the
faulty one band with

566
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:50,970
a but and this should hopefully dispel
some the

567
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,589
are rumors I believe I'm sure everybody

568
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:59,178
felt that the team lines were on your
internet access was a little slow

569
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:03,720
I I don't think it was slow to the point
of being unusable because I was actually

570
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,168
a siege outs to my shell box message
back in to do some the management

571
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:11,259
and had an outside doing interactive
typing and dr.

572
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,169
once while you get a little bit choppy
but for the most part it was pretty you

573
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:14,839
know I

574
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:18,668
is pretty damn fast cell on that was not
you know during

575
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:22,569
our you know saturation the team I'm so
I'm

576
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:26,790
me a pretty confident that your the the
2t one's a band with were plenty we

577
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,058
didn't need you know 100 gig

578
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:31,279
100 I'm megabits mean it like some
people work you know

579
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:34,799
we needed in order to handle all these
wireless users you can skip to the next

580
00:34:34,799 --> 00:34:35,369
one

581
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,480
which looks exactly the same I A the

582
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,440
there's two teams gonna same router they
will obviously load balance so obviously

583
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,279
the

584
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:46,940
the picture should look the same except
for a if you look three days before

585
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,480
yeah i think i am. okay tax this is
actually a better map because that very

586
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,240
first on Spike

587
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,339
I i believe snaps taken that's when our
team wins Rupp

588
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:00,319
and then when the spike the you know
where Edwards plank

589
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:03,359
that's when the teams were down and
dirty ones came back up

590
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,529
and then the teens when town many to
interrupt the rest the conference so

591
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,010
that's pretty much what the what

592
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,490
got some the palms of slain in a few
minutes a and as we don't have too much

593
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:14,710
time hopefully we'll get into the what
happened when Brize the horizon ordeal

594
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,619
are gonna next slide alright so oh well
you can't really be that

595
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:23,200
bites Art Museum man any chance anyway
and with this is a break out of the

596
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,059
on least the stats per day Seth he can
give me a

597
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,540
just the rundown fun after each day how
it went with the wireless users were

598
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,420
compared to the wired users

599
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,200
I arm I kinda thought about maybe

600
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,230
ICE 10 weaknesses on

601
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,910
day 8 so it looks like we had about 100
total like a hunt

602
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:48,450
840 unique users on requesting the city
leases

603
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,839
others in 140 some-odd our users we had
about six hundred ninety

604
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:56,640
have them were from our while 0 gas
identities have a house was really

605
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,240
that's right

606
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,309
exact I hardest so others in 148 users
are 690 or so

607
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:06,029
where Wireless a hundred troops out a
hundred or so

608
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:10,029
were I'll wired on the beach bring your
own computer area

609
00:36:10,029 --> 00:36:13,299
and that third number is so how many are
not people

610
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:16,540
Sammy not people do we have the bottom

611
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,290
he expects about 37 not people that
sounds about right yeah i right

612
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,859
so I am Sat shows you that in a while so
as a

613
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:27,150
you know on a a.m. very important

614
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,369
the the very substantial part of our
network this year

615
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:34,549
I mesmo seu you know the past years
where he was either aforethought are we

616
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:35,910
didn't have wireless at all

617
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,029
on it shows you how important it was to
get this wireless infrastructure

618
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:42,109
working somewhere da dragon did all that
work to get done you know

619
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:46,140
other since 1994 while issues up and
running on the network

620
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:53,140
on on last interesting sad is that

621
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,930
i think im 140 is approximately forty
percent

622
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,430
our attendance numbers you know just how
important not this

623
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,589
net what up slightly less why the hell
you run a network for this conference

624
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:09,250
while

625
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,220
you know the service good number people
that actually came here in montana be on

626
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,700
the network obviously so

627
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:19,240
my tips your hound people how it does
anybody know how many people we had

628
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,970
okay so it's gets closer to little under
50 percent something forty fifty percent

629
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,400
of its

630
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,270
pretty substantial number I think that's
about it for the statistics

631
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,779
others that happen again yeah we have a
three minutes

632
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:34,380
I die I promise I will be of you in
three minutes late as quickly go through

633
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,490
what went wrong

634
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,250
are number one horizon are they really
screwed us over this time

635
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,400
a lot Its a very aggravated with them
Island

636
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,060
they were supposed to bring in eighty
ones and apparently and

637
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,650
well boo debtors them siemens is what we
saw last week

638
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,339
me and said it did the work apparently
%uh they've got to flip the switch

639
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,500
on the smart card I where which I'll

640
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,089
it to I got check about on it 11 hours

641
00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:03,950
on the phone constantly yelling at rise
in dispatch rising custom services MCI

642
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,900
Worldcom

643
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,230
dispatch I each time social engineering
why more information about my purse all

644
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,490
we have is a circuit ID

645
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,240
second ID's managed to get more contact
numbers more out the trouble tickets on

646
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,040
each side

647
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,720
we got them actually talking to each
other which is are very rare occurrence

648
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,829
apparently

649
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:24,060
and finally she got ahold attack and
attacked older with the problem was he

650
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,490
was down here in half an hour

651
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:29,089
flip the switch in left and we had
internet access ants

652
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:32,540
everybody rejoiced I again unfortunately
some

653
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,069
I am some asshole actually I unplugged
our t1 line

654
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:40,960
and an asshole that worked for the
building sellouts very surprising

655
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,099
I am he was trying to show us where the
dirty ones were

656
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,359
anti said oh here it is hoops any not
that one who leads

657
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,680
so a we didn't have internet access yet
have a

658
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,210
Bryce come down and fix it again and get
the second he went up and running

659
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,700
so finally big did that was about 9 p.m.
they guess during the radio show

660
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,920
was when the internet came back up and
running so I think rise in for Qatar

661
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,150
a rock their fries in closet I

662
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,880
in the hotel and somebody went in and
power hit the power switch

663
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,450
on the smart card so activity was keen
on again

664
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,950
I had other East race the fire he found

665
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,079
which black man passes closet he went in
and I

666
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:24,710
power cycle the that smart cards we had
in it again

667
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,960
I think those last farm horizon travel
so

668
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,119
again this is something next time around
we will not discount

669
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,200
mill not to underestimate prizes recipe
for screwing us over

670
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,440
on so I guess the next thing we are we
as he so we had some

671
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,869
band with graphs are I think we coulda
had nice again with grass

672
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:46,290
if we had some better than with
management I forgot it with all the

673
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,470
chaos and it never got a chance to set
at any rate limiting on

674
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,900
peace Cisco South para mi going to ACA
conference is a good time to

675
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,009
like an IPTV networks so you know that

676
00:39:57,009 --> 00:40:01,020
military to some other networks on S
next time around we intend to me limits

677
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,770
on that stuff I just so that

678
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,900
you can't have you no more useful like
reasons for the internet

679
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,440
about Mina that's something for next
time on I think

680
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,259
I am my car he spoke generally spoke
about the wireless attacks and things

681
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:16,349
anything my audio we saw a couple of new
ones

682
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:20,670
arm I log something in the vicinity of
nine hundred different

683
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,750
attacks against the WiFi network cell

684
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:28,150
across a lot of those were one person
more likely but we got a lot of them

685
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,520
sir I we have one more minute I the only
other thing I actually am

686

was at our in a sort of like a hangout

688
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,349
area in the NOC

689
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:45,569
core area next time we just push that
back to where that area

690
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:49,140
than other areas the table yet selfie
disperse at

691
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,720
separate a knock staff area in an hour
core area

692
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,089
where people who actually arm working on
bring up the actual network or calling

693
00:40:57,089 --> 00:40:59,390
Verizon and yelling at customer service

694
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,710
they can do so peacefully and then out
that outside not carry a

695
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,140
where people you are working the NOC
staff need to be for supporting the not

696
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,680
liking people coming over questions

697
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,779
they have the this space to do that and
also when they're bored when there's

698
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:12,790
nobody around speaking actually have you
know

699
