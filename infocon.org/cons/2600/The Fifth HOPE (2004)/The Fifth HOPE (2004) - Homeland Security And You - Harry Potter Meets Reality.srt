arm think you all for coming this is a
pretty open

7
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:25,529
our session were soliciting ideas

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,579
I how many have you guys were at the
lockpicking panel earlier today

9
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,930
okay so lots here well let me give you a
brief background

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,040
I'm basically I'd like you guys interact

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,310
on this panel of I know it's already
sorta late in the evening

12
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,690
maybe not for some love you are y'all

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,120
look amazingly away arm I've

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,070
worked in government as well as a
private sector I'm a lawyer

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,640
I work in Sioux Falls South Dakota by
travel all over the world doing what I

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,220
do

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,629
arm part in my practice involves fraud
investigations and partisan involves

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,989
really high tech stuff

19
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,880
and breaking high-security locks and
consulting with some clients both in the

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,399
private and public sector

21
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:13,630
and I'm lucky enough to get to travel
the world lotto

22
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,109
really out-of-the-way places in the
world and getting iraq with a lot of

23
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,699
people

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,009
arm it's occurred to me in my travels in
my meetings with our clients and

25
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,069
government folks are

26
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:29,979
I interact with that we have a real
serious resource problem in america

27
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,689
especially dealing with our

28
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:34,889
terrorism problem but also

29
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:39,530
just in business and the billions and
billions of dollars we have in

30
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,509
fraudulent loss in this country

31
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,759
to say nothing of the common market are
the European Community

32
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,560
and it occurred to me a while back and

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,869
I talk to some of my friends and I work
with forever there

34
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:58,450
very high level on the government that
america really ought to have a strategic

35
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,349
policy up developing security
specialists from when

36
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:07,909
they're very young so they develop the
tools and thought processes

37
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:11,520
art to go forth out of college

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,500
back into the community would be at
government or private-sector

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,530
and contribute to help protect this
country and other countries

40
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,900
now if and as I said my back my
background goes back

41
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,680
I am I'm a lawyer I also have a law
enforcement

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,150
undergraduate background have written

43
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,390
5 please text books over the years and

44
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,880
were I used to be I'm in my former life

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,260
she for the organized crime unit in
South Dakota for the officer attorney

46
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,359
general and Saul

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,110
I've I've got no work a lot I really
need cases and have a

48
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,850
pretty both in the public and the
private sector and so

49
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,329
the premises that we ought to have a
national strategic policy of developing

50
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,630
arm a cadre love specialists

51
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:07,210
and its I started picking locks when I
was 15

52
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,920
much to the chagrin of my parents arm

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,110
my dad it's an engineer my mom's retired
teacher

54
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,260
and so I grew up in a professional
environment but they still

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,820
were pretty upset that I was picking my
way and everything in

56
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,660
phone freaking across the world and

57
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:31,109
I am and so what I'd like to do is
challenge you guys to think I Britain

58
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,440
a brief description I love what

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,609
I would perceive arm would be their
goals and

60
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,000
won a national security College on to do

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,270
I the fact is we really are low on
resources in this country

62
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,340
as other countries are in this
particular area and I for two other

63
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,260
panels while I've been here discussing

64
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,480
this similar this issue and similar
terms

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,330
basically with the same idea in mind
although nobody is really

66
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,010
I elicited listen exactly

67
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,150
arm and the reason I came up with the
title

68
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,520
I Harry Potter meets reality because

69
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,410
if the potential for a national security
college

70
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,980
were to come to fruition we're really
talking

71
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,570
about an academy that would train
everybody

72
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,990
not in magic but what appears to be
magic to a lot of the public as they see

73
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,570
on television

74
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,260
were were talking about the ability to
think your way through a problem

75
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,180
the ability to do think alternatively
one of the things that I've

76
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,560
really figured out over the years

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,139
arm notwithstanding what the public
perception is a lot of hackers

78
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,570
that is that they're criminals arm

79
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,740
actually you all have

80
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,740
a lot to offer and if if you're willing
to offer it

81
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,740
I the the bottom line is there's a

82
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,889
there's a to me here's what the hacker
profile is

83
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,190
you guys are bright you're clever you're
persistent

84
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,389
you're focused and you think out of the
box

85
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:24,310
and in in my world I I solve

86
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,389
physical security problems involving
locks

87
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,060
and the problems are very sought all

88
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,210
they're not supposed to be there they're
not supposed to be solved

89
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,560
because they're not supposed to exist
arm

90
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,880
the manufacturers spend millions and
millions of dollars on

91
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,260
research and development or are supposed
to

92
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,909
to produce locks the guys like me guys
like barry wells guys like John fall

93
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,500
I mark Bates quite a quite a cadre of us

94
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,220
are not supposed to be able to get in to
you

95
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,940
because there's design the faxer
security problems

96
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,610
whether it's a lock a computer a
computer network

97
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,050
a system an access control system

98
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,150
there's a million variations DVD's cars

99
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,540
everything in america today really
everything in the world is as you know

100
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,250
as things become more standardized

101
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,800
there's the potential to brake systems

102
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,510
regardless of what they are that's just
the nature of how things work

103
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,130
and this at the end to the day is
costing everybody

104
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,820
and you in me a great deal of money and
physical security

105
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,290
and so the premises if we can channel

106
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,340
the energy arm first of all

107
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,630
I've talked to folks that have indicated
that

108
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,860
there really is a need for such an
academy

109
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,510
now there's there's lotsa lotsa
questions and and let me just

110
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,690
read what I road opp

111
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,330
I and basically is an outline

112
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,389
and then this will give you an idea I'll

113
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:12,560
where we could go

114
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,960
arm

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,110
it's basically

116
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,699
the concept of the Academy is simple

117
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,669
first select include incredibly bright
kids age 12 to 15

118
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:34,270
is a base age from diverse backgrounds
with extremely high potential in math

119
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,520
science physics chemistry language logic

120
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,150
and conceptualization skills next

121
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,770
put them together in the most high-tech
training facility that has ever been

122
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,240
created for such a purpose

123
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,720
in order that they might be immersed in
a challenging curriculum

124
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,710
the div would develop the necessary
skills for problem solving in

125
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,360
non-traditional means

126
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,630
them employ the best instructors

127
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:06,440
to provide the necessary
multi-disciplinary training

128
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,719
in this setting up a physical facility
that supports the goals of the project

129
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,370
finally develop a curriculum that would
provide

130
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,570
the needed tools so that the students
could flourish

131
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:27,070
in such an environment and feed upon
each other's creativity and curiosity

132
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,320
and you have the potential to create us
core

133
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,599
cyber warriors to meet the technical
challenges of the 21st century

134
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,550
the confront our society you guys would
develop more expertise in their chosen

135
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,799
areas

136
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,120
and are actually put to work assessing
security issues Boehner abilities and

137
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,300
working investigations

138
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,700
240 plots involving technology

139
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,740
on like Harry Potter this academy

140
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,020
would deal in reality and the high-tech

141
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,790
magic that exist today

142
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,529
in certain sectors

143
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:12,649
kids employed in train and then as
adults and participate in participating

144
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,660
in government stew solve problems

145
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,100
arm that that is basically

146
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,410
the promise now there's there's a lot of
questions and i wanna

147
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,120
throw this open pretty quick to comments
an

148
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,310
if if you guys think there's potential
in our interest said

149
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,580
I'd really like you to email me your
ideas

150
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,640
because believe me they will be
correlated

151
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,000
and passed on I

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,320
and my email address and I've got cards
appear if you want a come but its am

153
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,100
W Tobias at security

154
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,120
dot or work arm

155
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,700
and any ideas would be welcome Sol

156
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,680
the first question is and there's a
microphone I think

157
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,149
right up in front there the first
question is

158
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,510
should this be a public us

159
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,160
the first question is do you think it's
a good idea

160
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,310
I guess that's where we sure what what
what's the consensus is a good idea bad

161
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,980
idea dumb idea

162
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,470
arm the idea this form was to be really
open

163
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,970
and just solicit information

164
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,610
so work is there a consensus does
everybody

165
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,920
does intrigue you guys to think about
this kinda thing

166
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,240
yes and no what's the No

167
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,140
the dip depends on

168
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,130
I'd say depends on its implementation
you touched on just before he said the

169
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,040
general is it a good idea you're about
to say

170
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,140
public or private right that is I think

171
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,880
what would trouble a lot of us year

172
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,950
many people when we when we hear about a
specialized institution or specialized

173
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,170
training

174
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,930
conceive love not and open in public
army of people willing to help

175
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,230
their whole community but a specialized
group

176
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,589
under a specialized command taking
orders from

177
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,290
who knows there are many people here who
would love to make their

178
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,520
their country safer but I don't think
there's a lot of

179
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,620
well I can speaker there's plenty people
here who wouldn't want to do it at the

180
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,230
behest

181
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,910
government there's plenty people here
would love to overthrow their government

182
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,010
let alone obey it

183
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,560
I figure that out I

184
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,000
you know i'd in a peaceful manner yes
yeah

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,500
so I I would say I like what you have to
say as long as its open to anyone who

186
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,450
wants to enroll

187
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,459
and would be very publicly carried out
okay but what what kinda selection

188
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,529
criteria do you have

189
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,170
first of all you have to funding now the
private sector may find that

190
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,959
the government what if the government
provided grants but it was a private

191
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,769
school

192
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,500
I wouldn't be able to support it at that
time I say raise your hand at stand-up

193
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,470
answer the call and if you wash out
because you're not good enough then you

194
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,260
watch out

195
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,019
okay but who determines who determines
let's talk about selection criteria

196
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,940
who determine selection criteria people
here man

197
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,470
or pull out say public review part of
the process would be

198
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,870
a public consensus have certain skill
levels what you can attain what you

199
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,970
can't do

200
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,970
and everything every regulation in every
grade of progress

201
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,160
would be a publicly review and publicly
accepted

202
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
criteria ok and when you say publicly
what's your idea

203
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,680
that mean the community as a whole all
participants

204
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,970
would be accessible to every level up
decision making in every level upgrade

205
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,230
upgrading an assessment how the progress
of the institution and the individuals

206
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,310
being achieved

207
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,320
should be every single person should
have input

208
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,550
and say well I think you know ratio
hands do we think we're doing this well

209
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,580
yes or no

210
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,709
or as much as it could be emotionally
damaging show of hands is John Smith

211
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,760
up to the task no I'm not I'm sorry go
away

212
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,610
sources like Survivor I wouldn't make
that comparison

213
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,410
are about so many other folks

214
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,930
little up it at all to get into back and
forth to it

215
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,959
an intriguing prospect and I'll the big
thing is

216
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:21,110
implementation selection for example

217
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,779
mentioned a kids who are very good in
science and math

218
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:29,640
but some other people can think outside
the box might not be

219
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,709
doing well academically because the
camby's

220
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,730
the fact they think outside the box is
it

221
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,769
is there not compatible with the school

222
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:43,920
there in they are might be viewed as too
weird were all

223
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
attention deficit disorder or whatever

224
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,220
so care is needed for the selection

225
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,459
a you know the use SAT scores

226
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,390
but what if that thought the testing
measures compliance and thinking within

227
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,769
the box

228
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:03,519
so there's gonna be a lot of challenges
but it's an intriguing idea and I hope

229
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,950
email you in after I think more about it

230
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,680
thank you thank you

231
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,510
hi your continuing on nightline just
that out my thoughts is just

232
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,399
a time in general when you have an
academy area come a common curriculum

233
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,820
then a don't you also bring in the
problems have like well everybody has to

234
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,700
follow along with curriculum and
therefore getting public group think

235
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,320
well okay but here's the problem if if
you're going to have an academy the

236
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,209
teachers

237
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,380
both a general liberal arts curriculum
to get you

238
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,439
let's say you started age 15

239
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,459
you gotta get you through what's
considered high school and then

240
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,959
it would be a college curriculum plus
all the special courses

241
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,959
so you have to have standards and some
rules just like any college

242
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,480
otherwise your degree doesn't mean
anything when you go back out in the

243
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,810
real world

244
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,920
so how do you deal with that I'd argue a
lot of people here

245
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,130
are really big on rules yeah I know I
understand that

246
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm unfortunately the real world

247
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,079
is big on rules I mean that's how it
runs so high

248
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,510
you know you have to deal with networked
me the other day after earn a living

249
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,149
what you I'm pretty happy my parents
basement

250
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,570
yeah I cannot not up it's a at some
point they're gonna throw you out at the

251
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,510
house

252
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:27,819
I doubt it I'm trying to figure out if
this is kind of like West Point

253
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,190
or I mean I can see how it's like hard
work

254
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,649
but I can see if it's more like west
pointer that Defense Language Institute

255
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,279
or some kind of

256
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,339
specialized is it at the college level
you're talking about younger than that

257
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,350
yeah I did you start you got a story on
your mind uprooting

258
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,089
junior high school students and taking
them into this very specialized thing

259
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,320
early

260
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,720
now so there is our there is a problem
which might be able to solve

261
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,380
a young hackers who get in trouble with
the law

262
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,300
that's a great idea with a response
there's nothing like the California

263
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,670
Conservation Corps

264
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,680
right where they get out and plant trees
this guy or a spire

265
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,170
mark these guys never heard the CCC okay

266
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,889
well are I don't know how to describe it
it's basically route

267
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:18,420
you know tough love right for young
offenders you had to boot camp right

268
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,639
on but for example they're precluded
from using computers that precluded from

269
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,450
working

270
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,470
with computers once they're convicted am
that's all the good at

271
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,730
so it's really stupid summer manage to
pull community service or parole

272
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,360
now community service is much less
authoritarian then

273
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,310
what write some the people here are
worried about but it's much less

274
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,480
doctrinaire in defined by a

275
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,130
top-down command structure look at how
colin powell has done

276
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,510
by sticking to being the good soldier
right right

277
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,350
I and well yeah but yet you have to
understand how the new by where the CIA

278
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,720
as we get it

279
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,180
yeah we can connect it only cost a
thousand lives when we get it now

280
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,620
right now well anyway

281
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,640
so I'm thinking maybe for younger
offenders to be out placed rather than

282
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,640
just be on probation and do community
service

283
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,059
in this general area might be a good
thing let me tell one of my favorite

284
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:17,449
three minutes traces your I had dinner
last night we were talking about

285
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,230
stories in the context a security and
everybody needs to know what you do

286
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,209
which is

287
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,400
physical security analysis as well as
other things

288
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,970
and so you're also concerned about
issues that

289
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,960
I get involved in arm how many you guys
understand

290
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,250
what phone freaking wise

291
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,470
others more than I thought there was
okay

292
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,030
so then you're all understand my other
email address multi free kit security

293
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,500
dot or

294
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,840
arm about fifteen years ago there was a
arm

295
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,709
big story in the like the new york times
that I happen to read

296
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,950
delta airlines reservation center was at
the Omni Hotel in Atlanta

297
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,510
remember this and the first set and so
the story I read I knew what the problem

298
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,850
was that took Bell Labs three years to
solve

299
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,250
and millions and millions of dollars
Delta Air Lines

300
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,500
had all their reservation agents in the
lobby area

301
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,290
up the Omni Hotel and trademark up the
Omni Hotel was birds flying around

302
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,510
okay how many Rd know what the problem
is

303
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,290
okay they had on their 800 numbers

304
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,970
and this was one eight hundred calls
cost thirty cents amana

305
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,130
they had a random disconnect problem 3

306
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,410
years there was a slight What's My Line

307
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:51,380
okay 2600 yeah the birds are chirping
2600

308
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,320
because all it takes is about 40
milliseconds have a 2600 cycle Paul's to

309
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,418
tell the far end see all

310
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,490
are we got an idol trying go ahead and
make it available for multi freak out

311
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,780
Paul saying

312
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,580
3 years it took Bell Labs all they had
to do was

313
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,678
higher some phone free Kors and they
could have told them in one

314
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,660
second when I watched television
programs

315
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,510
I the other night I was watching in the
heat of the night

316
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,530
about the the lawyer that was involved
in a murder with kathleen turner

317
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,540
they actually recorded audio of a phone
call that she made long distance to him

318
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,230
and the reason I know the record it is
there was about

319
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,770
10 milliseconds 2600 cycle

320
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,918
so they actually recorded the call you
know like 10-15 years ago when they made

321
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,799
the movie

322
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,470
and so this is my prime example of why
we should hire

323
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,510
the folksy you guys are getting into
trouble

324
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,320
because you have a lot to offer it just
has to be channeled I mean you have to

325
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,809
understand there are some rules

326
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,330
there's rules everywhere whether you
like it or not and

327
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,439
but the bottom line is you guys can be

328
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,230
incredibly bright incredibly creative

329
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,520
and you know how to solve problems
without the restrictions

330
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,860
love even the way mark and I think about
a problem we evaluate something contrary

331
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,500
have stereotypes

332
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,490
our stuff we've seen before so we have
preconceived ideas

333
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,539
you guys don't have very many
preconceived ideas and that's what we're

334
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,379
talking about

335
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,770
to train yet to bring that to a new
level yessir

336
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,918
arm I was wondering if you knew about
the National Science Foundation

337
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:34,770
Scholarship for service program

338
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,110
are make a Sitecore now okay

339
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,450
the the National Science Foundation from
a craft congress

340
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,500
arm is doling out millions of dollars to
schools ok

341
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,500
across the US to offer scholarships for
scholarships

342
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,500
about grad students and undergrads a to
study information security

343
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,840
arm the grant the scholarship last for
two years

344
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,949
arm said to you dear get a graduate
degree refinish

345
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,429
undergrad and then when you finish you
go to work for the federal government

346
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,400
for dryers

347
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,940
right arm I'm in this program

348
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,090
and really allows you to to learn a lot
of the things that you need to know

349
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:16,370
from an information security you point
are I don't know if all schools

350
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,429
get into vulnerability analysis I
analysis type ideas

351
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:23,750
but they do teach fundamental security
problems

352
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,260
and issues that you want to address when
you're building secure system right

353
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,830
so it's really a wave building things
from the ground up strand

354
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,379
pageant pray from the top down right

355
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,190
so arm its is open to all that

356
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,169
one component right it's one component
of a broad curriculum

357
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,590
exactly so it you know the

358
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,149
the government is addressing this idea
schooling people and runways and getting

359
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,960
the right again specific areas

360
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,280
right right the question is do we need

361
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,668
some type of a national college just
like the National War College

362
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:04,620
to bring really bright kids in

363
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,340
and really give them an education and
then turn around and go back out

364
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,668
to use directly to the federal
government

365
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:15,340
are not necessary look private
industries got the same problem

366
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:20,289
it's not just the federal government if
you look at law statistics

367
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,929
it's not just the federal government
I'll its everywhere

368
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:28,059
I agree yes I mean information
Security's was a problem for everyone

369
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:31,970
its I mean coming learning what I want
so far you know

370
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,169
you know that people have been ignoring
it for so long and then I'll

371
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:38,270
yeah now we get the idea so you know its

372
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,280
is one with addressing the problem but
as for creating a specific Academy

373
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,668
I don't think I agree with that just
just because in the fact that

374
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:50,590
arm I

375
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,189
as he says my opinion I can formulate a
guitar right now it okay

376
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,510
thank you yessir I'll

377
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,710
if you make a federal what is going with
their a silly or

378
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,650
school gym is gonna be as competitive as
like NSA and CIA scholarships is gonna

379
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,250
be

380
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,650
thousands upon thousands of people won't
apply for this this is going to be an

381
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,140
elite job

382
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,530
so you're gonna have hardly slept in
your letter with applications toward the

383
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,780
board like they do like military
applications for West Point and Naval

384
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,110
Academy

385
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,350
so you're gonna play a people are gonna
do this

386
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,380
and its cool is gonna happy federal
certified it's on like this

387
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,090
CIA and stuff I want these kids are
going highly trains 15

388
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,699
221 to see is what these kids so

389
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,309
the pie pay for any artwork them like
four years

390
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:39,840
what you do in the military your maybe
it could be a joint venture between the

391
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,530
government and the private sector

392
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,830
the governments gonna wanna lick is
unlike year take the some

393
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,230
we get this highly-trained 10 my the
fuck is

394
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,370
the ones on girl than once the federal
government

395
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:58,039
yeah I what may be the rejects gonna
private private industry

396
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,320
yessir are water what you're saying here

397
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,590
you know the basic debate over this
setting up a west point

398
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,240
was almost the same thing where should
we have a century 'em

399
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,909
a national militia or should we have a a
professional or me

400
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:17,980
this debate raid greatly before

401
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,510
West Point and well into the time West
Point was

402
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,400
was established their attempt to shut
down West Point once it had been

403
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,380
established

404
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,799
so this echoes historically what
happened with wood

405
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,600
you know the point however I must tell
you I have a strongly conservative

406
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,659
background

407
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,350
server at a time when constitutional

408
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,280
rights or there's a great debate over

409
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,440
the pope future porn they're gonna take
at a time

410
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,900
when the united states government is he
the one boy

411
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,280
greatly influenced by private lead

412
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,789
organizations their operate largely in
the plaque

413
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,690
how many people know what to lose his
trust is how many people know what the

414
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,799
Council on Foreign Relations is

415
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,320
or the Bilderberg Group with the
Trilateral Commission these the

416
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,000
people who are running the government
now and formulating the policy

417
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,549
now you got a war going on with you
coming from

418
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:22,590
the bottom line is at a time when we
have many privately to organizations

419
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,408
having all kinds a on to win Florence

420
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:32,740
what now now we're going concentrate

421
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,390
the technical cream America into an
Egyptian priesthood

422
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,880
who they gonna be working for the
elected officials

423
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,159
hang listen the elected officials or
given the orders anymore in this country

424
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,270
so the thing is that i'm saying yes
there is no water waster technical

425
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,100
knowledge

426
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,190
I mean first or the funding science in
this country is crazy there's no money

427
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,760
for

428
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,059
funding for energy medicine there's no
funding for zero point energy my god

429
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,990
we're running out of energy I agree with
all that this tremendous waste is

430
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,100
tremendous to

431
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:10,190
de pocas however there are grave dangers
in what you're saying

432
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:15,049
more now because the technology around
the terrorists Western century

433
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:19,480
was mosque its okay now we're now we're
talking about

434
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,100
really deadly technology that you can
cook up in your home

435
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:28,760
you wanna concentrate everything into an
Egyptian priesthood is going to have a

436
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,370
them

437
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,730
very very dangerous thinking there are
many many

438
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,840
dangerous downside and a time when
government is doing was doing

439
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,940
concentrate more concentration of power
your point to secret societies they're

440
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,450
running the government now

441
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:49,070
sole-source so you wouldn't think would
be a good idea to have john ashcroft is

442
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,418
the first in a student's

443
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,460
I don't tempt me

444
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,210
I want temptme thank you

445
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,360
thank you

446
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,150
Cup of

447
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:13,190
regular course 3 for you sir what
exactly do you mean by

448
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,600
part private and public sector have you

449
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,750
what do I mean by private sector both

450
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,370
by versus public sector what the sector

451
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,100
well I mean its it's a broad there's
either government

452
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,760
or there's private

453
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,000
like all coming corpore

454
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
yet to talk close to the mic from Isner
coming together now

455
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,049
by corporations and no multinational
companies

456
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:47,240
yeah but you know the corporations or
stall essentially private a lesser

457
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,490
defense contractors

458
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,730
than what is in private

459
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,970
there's a lotta not private everything
from banks to insurance companies to

460
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:00,000
media to everything that's not
government

461
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,270
or who wants them

462
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,158
stockholders you deal really

463
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,559
I and what do you think would it

464
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:15,149
happen if you just took a much in avoid

465
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,760
people at a very young age even younger
than in 12 what's a

466
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,440
and just told them how to break
everything overall

467
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,419
and that it done what's what fortunately
a lot amor figuring out on their own

468
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:34,620
but what if what if they were well
because it needs to be channeled

469
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,870
were yeah why

470
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,480
well okay

471
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,049
art because if if you channel a to
solving problems

472
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:52,799
the question is whether you want to help
solve problems

473
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,210
if a lot a thousand people acting on
their own

474
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,590
doesn't help me a a thousand people in a
concerted

475
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:03,419
effort it does help you

483
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:35,309

code system

484

I think you guys are but first now

485
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:43,440

486
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,740
letter number letter number latter yeah
okay so going out

487
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,840
adjustments we're here to help your are
arm

488
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,010
just in I've talked with Robert Steele
and others about

489
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:59,789
scaring for for quite a while and the
seams his whole idea of taking the

490
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:01,350
talent that is obviously out there

491
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,559
the skills that are needed within the
public sector and then

492
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,260
bringing them into of all and putting
them to task for

493
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,020
you know various national protection
whatever

494
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,080
it just seems to me that when you're
taking people into this fall

495
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,928
and indoctrinating even if you're
stealing

496
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:23,809
have their finery that you're still
taking away and clean the environment

497
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:26,940
I don't usually bring them and you
should be inviting

498
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,480
in why not talk to my going snapping
them up off the street not

499
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,580
no reason bringing them in and in that
their teens

500
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,639
and training them in militia military
nah nah nah nah nah nah no

501
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,330
sup non totally nonviolent first of all
not I'm the same just okay sorta

502
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,470
organ and I was gonna get to that as far
as potential courses in the curriculum

503
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,299
other than liberal arts stuff okay so go
ahead

504
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:54,250
and then we're gonna I'm NASCAR body
what do you think courses are to be

505
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:54,760
essentially

506
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,658
you you're always going to have your
rank and file geeks I read it to do

507
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:01,980
you know to push buttons on you know war
machines that

508
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,870
arm but that's not really what we're
talking about I know

509
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,120
by why not have a more open thing where
you got the tower already out there

510
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,600
bring them

511
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,909
in say we need this sort of task dine

512
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:16,929
invite them and I mean as my friend here
said

513
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,360
everybody's want to defend their country
maybe no I

514
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,090
in such a a direct method but if there's
a threat and

515
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,929
you can solve it I mean to know about
how would you do that

516
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:31,890
if because the minute you do that you're
making the threat known and that you're

517
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,909
working to solve it to the bad guys

518
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,380
so how do you do that well when you
start offering under

519
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,110
a secret cloak a bully people you've
trained and authorized end there's so

520
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,760
many people

521
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,149
out there you are already missing that
wouldn't think not only doing this but

522
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:51,799
if they knew okay I'm already working on
this earth thing in my basement

523
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:55,379
my step forward in safely get a country
years after solution or

524
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,880
the entire thing okay but the reality is
what they come forward and help

525
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,730
in the case is a national pride
patriotism a lot of people would

526
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,480
outside you know all sorts politics are
gonna right now

527
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,730
okay imminent threat never that

528
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:21,539
lawn out that that would be a novel
fought

529
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:28,539
I mean once we got through watergate we
never had any more problems have one

530
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:37,590
right right that's right

531
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,230
as

532
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,240
as just a mic s two thoughts together

533
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,080
okay arm is notes on the military that

534
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,290
amateur star tactics professional stop

535
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,170
logistics right and legislatures where
does the money come from

536
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,300
that's right thought is looking at
history here in new york city for

537
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:04,780
instance

538
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,420
the City University of New York used to
be free right

539
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,710
two people could qualify to get in
talkable close I like survey

540
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,870
here and we chose or whatever

541
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,430
the state shows arm we started charging
for city views

542
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,820
City University New York the same year
that we passed rockefeller

543
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:27,240
loss basically two increase the prison
populations been going up ever since

544
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,330
maybe we should be investing our
education system are

545
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:36,190
with cuts from the prison industrial
complex well when you shake cuts from

546
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,490
the prison industrial complex what does
that mean

547
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,310
well we're driving more and more we have
policies are driving more more people

548
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,159
into crime

549
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,640
I drug laws things like that I mean

550
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,670
it's a couple molecules difference
between say

551
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,180
some drugs getting the drug store and
what don't convict people for

552
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:00,020
your but yeah that's true but that's a
different policy

553
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,129
that's a whole different policy range
that

554
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,290
sort is outside the scope of this I say
the other side too is it

555
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,870
right now the Department of Homeland
Security because i dont have civil

556
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,779
service protection

557
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,390
is essentially a patronage police force
so

558
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:18,310
we're just basically gonna be augmenting
the pic patronage police force

559
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:22,179
maybe get them at younger ages too so
they can be indoctrinated more

560
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:22,759
thoroughly

561
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,410
but when I start to think about that
look at the government's they've done

562
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,129
that in the past right like nazi germany

563
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,650
I difficult push you you know but

564
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,270
the other thing as too if you remember
that's the republican guard are usually

565
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,850
separated from their parents recognize
now that takes on new meaning doesn't

566
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,480
the Republican Guard

567
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,400
I says that it's very very scary thought
to and you look at the pattern in

568
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,010
history

569
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,260
they want to get them young enough to
indoctrinate them but at that point it

570
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,630
becomes very dangerous Warner

571
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,820
carriers thought about that for a
campaign phrase push you

572
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,360
thank you

573
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,490
I hey there yet just want to take touch
base on the

574
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,530
whole common algae using with the Harry
Potter meets reality

575
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,960
because allow these things that you
people bring up are also

576
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,030
kinda discussed within this is the books
being that

577
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,950
yes the teaching these kids how to use
magic but the night hitting on whether

578
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,609
to use it

579
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:24,870
for good purposes or iPad purposes right
so week I don't think we can just tell

580
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,580
people

581
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,470
we can't we can do is think that people
might do are so many Mike take control

582
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,110
or something

583
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:34,260
because I would just stop any sort of
progress outright I mean something like

584
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,250
this could be very good for

585
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,430
a lot of different sectors the public
private and me maybe you know

586
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,940
if you think that nobody ever thought of
how every

587
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,220
like I said I I don't think people
should be too worried about you know

588
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,590
creating like this mass

589
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:53,400
love you know controlled hey it's not
the Manchurian Candidate

590
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,690
so basically I mean like

591
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,400
people they bring up like to pass their
bill you know you're creating like a

592
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,920
priest

593
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,270
a priesthood will it has that potential
yes

594
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,800
and even if he's a keeper from young age
I mean if you're

595
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,950
any bus wrote the book in a term from
young age and they could become like

596
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,370
this

597
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,710
gradual was it but for the most part if
people have

598
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,890
if the program is proper with the right
with

599
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,160
with the right steps taken people will
be willing to

600
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,600
you realize there's you like their
skills an intense in a public fashion as

601
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,160
well because

602
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,850
I mean people who are working against
them know that their

603
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:33,180
majestic made it already known whether
we can do so it's just a matter of right

604
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,000
training someone to think outside the
box and to utilize their skills

605
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,180
better than someone else knew I their
skills this in the day you

606
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,990
that the day there would be an academy
like this should be a million

607
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,080
applications

608
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,250
there would be received on line right
and I think also should prolly

609
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:52,470
also be more invitation based so I just
like people

610
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,880
just randomly applying is that alright
take a got no allied world the

611
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,000
just people who just people watching all
the councillors in all the high schools

612
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,350
they all know whether

613
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,460
the kids are given that they don't they
don't have

614
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,770
you know account for them I schools
thought I was an idiot so was

615
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,110
how close was a I

616
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:18,440
the SKR models okay they told me that
they thought they saw me cuz those basic

617
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,880
about the nafta magazine in a way
communicating right to do well

618
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,800
now and I got when I got 1500 on the SAT
I have allergies shock

619
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,970
it better I cheated right cellular Sat

620
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,450
you know actually I worked a polygraph
case

621
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,830
years ago a kid got about four hundred
points above on his

622
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,940
on his SAT's and they accused him the
same thing a cheating

623
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,320
because he they said there's no way you
can I got the science Korean up right

624
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,000
now

625
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,220
basically yeah they hired ex-c_i_a_ arm
handwriting expert or

626
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,430
overs examine aidid fingerprints at the
end of the day they let him in a school

627
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,770
we want to go to

628
00:37:53,770 --> 00:38:00,170
I love it I like the idea okay thank you

629
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,170
I could be wrong but I believe

630
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:06,440
program that you're describing already
exists go ahead

631
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,480
and University georgetown it's called
national security college

632
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,470
yet while there's I dunno pieces in the
program

633
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,740
security a in for management and
security right for their schools that

634
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,620
have those

635
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,600
right and it's funded by the DIA so
right right

636
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,470
arm okay so we have 10 minutes left
essentially your 15 minutes left

637
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,630
talk to me about curriculum work what
about yessir

638
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,690
go ahead your high a possible let me
tell you that

639
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,600
idea is good and like that the gentleman
say to it's the implementation

640
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,339
that matters the most second thing is
let me second

641
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,440
the other gentlemen who say to that

642
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,680
up this you have to look for the
aptitude

643
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,950
in a student not read that not on the
bed that he or she is good

644
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,160
in now Matt R stands chemistry because I

645
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,220
its are about thinking outside the box
that Friday

646
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,400
acting is curriculum it should be open
it should be open to public review and

647
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,720
but by public review

648
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,900
I mean these people right okay these
people around here

649
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,530
other peers yes and our

650
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:17,410
like you know this people do not follow
standard Agri

651
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,920
that there must be some standards but

652
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,420
if they feel oppressive if they feel
that they are being suppressed are they

653
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:24,880
are being

654
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,920
are there are the outgoing commander
argues like zombies are

655
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,010
a Roberts they're not gonna work for you
not onerous

656
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:35,220
their own agenda right so it's a it's a
matter of trust

657
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,970
rather what you're seeing is repaying
you

658
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,220
but then you really do what do you want
you to do that's not gonna work

659
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,440
not be this kind of people not be too if
you tell me yeah I relearn everything

660
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,730
I athlete I do what I want to do

661
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:55,270
because well no one can on us

662
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,820
no one can really on us it all here and
here

663
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,650
but the bottom line is if somebody gives
you a tuition-free education

664
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:07,440
I don't care whether it's the you know
citibank or whether it's the CIA or

665
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,310
whether it's

666
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,779
you know whatever there's a commitment

667
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,060
and you either have to agree to honor
that commitment or you don't

668
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,350
yeah but you do not want to fall through
the cracks of standards that this is how

669
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,020
it is supposed to be because

670
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,550
this war in this world it is the word of

671
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:27,940
not this is how it is supposed to be but
what you can do

672
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,300
vid then it is not how it is supposed to
be when it is

673
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,520
it's basically if you think the if you
are talking about thinking outside the

674
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,310
box

675
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,340
at the same time you i think this is how
it is supposed to be

676
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,420
itself conflicting it's a conflict the
matter

677
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,080
right all I know is the instructors
would have a helluva good time

678
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,319
because the students at really have a
good time with them

679
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,860
of course that they have it they gotta
be better than us II absolutely

680
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,090
max going around that time thank you

681
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,690
okay I don't know if we have enough time
we got we got some time

682
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,750
do enough time to tell UN troops sorry
that you didn't get around to Margie's

683
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,840
maybe in five minutes next guy will try

684
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,260
would you consider having program

685
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,700
like and where you does with gal 10 in
which the students get to choose their

686
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,660
own major

687
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,100
you keep saying that they should think I

688
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,440
year within let's just say you had a
curriculum and you could choose

689
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,550
twenty different courses like you do now
as electives

690
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,820
and you could say okay I think I have an
aptitude for such and such like to

691
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,680
specialize in

692
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,529
sure I nobody's gonna look at this
happen

693
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,880
nobody's gonna say like the army you're
going into this you're going into that

694
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,540
we in our rate have to figure out what
they'd be good at

695
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,840
mean that's the track nobody wants guys
that

696
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:52,590
aren't good at something to excelente
because they won't

697
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:57,590
yessir you started to bring up the topic
of curriculum doubt courses

698
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,330
I think there's obviously some very
clear ones that are horribly not touched

699
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:01,910
upon in

700
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,240
regular educate analytic right-thinking
creative problem solving

701
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,150
up but one key assets yes one key aspect
that makes this community so

702
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,400
fantastic attacking problems if you
wanna call it thinking outside the box

703
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,930
or what have you

704
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,390
what i'd I would just say it's
questioning convention and questioning

705
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,250
authority I'm actually I am a teacher
and one of the things I tried to drill

706
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:24,650
into

707
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,490
every student's head I tell multi-quote
Chomsky I'll say no

708
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,560
every time someone ever tells you
something with a great deal certainty

709
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,920
the first thought your mind

710
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,840
is that true or is this person telling
me something accurately

711
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,420
the idea questioning authority
questioning it constantly I feel is an

712
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,350
indispensable talent right but i feels
very conflicting with the idea

713
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,730
I'll government or centralized service
service towards a goal or two words an

714
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,560
objective

715
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,630
how do you bring those two terms well
you cuz you have to reach balance

716
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:55,830
because at some point you have to take
certain things as truth

717
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:00,020
and you alike WMD we all know about that

718
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,350
are but but you know seriously you can't
learn anything

719
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,980
if you question everything I mean that's
that's the problem

720
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:11,200
I mean I tell our young I would I would
think a lot of people here myself

721
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,020
included disagree with that

722
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:18,270
well I mean you never get an education I
me you got you got eilers days and times

723
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:22,650
example the opposite last okay I i feel
like im giving a hard time

724
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:26,230
no no you're not I mean I ask a lot of
young kids when they come home

725
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:30,250
to their parents or friends of mine 10
12 years old and they said we learn this

726
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,500
in school and we don't

727
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,480
understand I sit tomorrow one ish ask
your teacher just raising answer why is

728
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,530
this relevant

729
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,610
and what's the reaction that you again

730
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,270
you know for sure go to be tension
that'll be the first reaction

731
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,800
but the it's really a good question why
is it relevant what I can learn how to

732
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,340
run

733
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,800
what to do math workout theorems today
when I got a calculator that'll do it

734
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,580
work okay

735
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:02,020
now well okay thank you I'll

736
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,170
Maxwell

737
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:11,160
yep

738
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,029
okay girl so

739
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:18,570
who's going to pay for the for the
college for people that will resist the

740
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,980
US government if that is ever needed

741
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,130
say like now

742
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,540
well i don't understood so repeat the
question your your

743
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,750
talking about somehow creating this body
of hackers that would defend

744
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,500
America against terrorism Oregon okay

745
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,610
and I I'm thinking a body a
free-thinking mines that would defend

746
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,750
America against the US government

747
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,030
I'm how would that be organized haiti's
that

748
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,550
should have because the whole idea of
all these people owning

749
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,860
having all the smart people having our
moral debt to

750
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,160
some centralized organization that Peter
tuition scares the fuck at me

751
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,230
I think it's called an election

752
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:06,250
me as and I bowled yeah

753
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,590
their work great in Florida and that

754
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,730
arm I don't know the answer to that

755
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,870
II don't know the answer that maybe then
all of this if you don't know the answer

756
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,870
to that maybe all of this is really a II
out how long answers

757
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,770
I that's why I'm asking you guys yessir

758
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,490
I've found a dove interest that the
previous speaker mention the 10th

759
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,190
attention deficit disorder because it
occurred to me that perhaps some of the

760
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,400
best minds

761
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,270
are the ones who do have attention
deficit disorder because often

762
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,990
taken hyperfocus on a problem right
think out of the box

763
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:42,190
and figure things out that somebody else
BB can't

764
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,370
is there any correlation between people
with attention deficit disorder and

765
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:48,009
people who can't think out of the box

766
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,960
I don't know I i honestly I don't know
the answer that

767
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:57,320
yessir this is going back to what the
Canadian germans

768
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,590
yet to talk up I think issue focus

769
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,670
on arm not

770
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:08,980
recruiting people for a specific task
force but for sending a problem out to

771
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,200
the knowledge test available out here
and the skill

772
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,800
a think a lot of people probably know
about have left the source code based on

773
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,580
not too long ago and everybody is really
night at that because it delayed

774
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,980
the progress of the game so that the
community is united in a track down

775
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,260
whoever it was attacking so I think when

776
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,890
the comedia gamers hackers use computer
enthusiasts

777
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,250
want to do something day unite and just
you don't have to train them

778
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,000
you just have to tell them what the
problem is

779
