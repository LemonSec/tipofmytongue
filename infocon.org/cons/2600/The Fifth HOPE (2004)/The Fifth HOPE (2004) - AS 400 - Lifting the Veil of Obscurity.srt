1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:03,929
and police to announce our next speaker

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,379
this is as/400 lifting the feel

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,770
obscurity by spanked are and his
colleague its welcome

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,450
thank killer

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,880
my colleague being 0db is gonna help

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,960
on on alright for small

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,400
I don't know how many people here have
ever used are familiar with an AI is

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,119
anybody ever

9
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,900
had any experience on that front up on

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,050
the thing is those behoove you to know
that is a pretty expensive system is a

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,489
very

12
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,539
heavy metal machinist got a lot of it's
very powerful that some

13
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:45,679
something funny universities large
corporations large companies it's very

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,039
on expensive in I'm very poor cell

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,460
what I've got in this presentation today
is some screenshots and capture video

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,120
capture

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,239
that show it and Lua being able to get
wanna have one here

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,179
to demonstrate so on but I'm basically I
do is just talk about generally what the

19
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,949
as/400 is about how it works

20
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,429
on kinda familiarize you with the
navigation up stuff like that

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,770
I work in as400 shop for about five or
six years for an advertising company

22
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,789
on a front is not something you can
learn

23
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:19,520
and a college or in school they don't
teach classes almost none that I've

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,009
never been to have been the five
different University up some never seen

25
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,140
a single class

26
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,439
offered on even basic as/400

27
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,530
on so basically I taught myself

28
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,979
starting in this job working third shift
operations which I know something you've

29
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:33,729
been there too

30
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:37,929
on kinda just sat there late at night
going to tutorials going to the help

31
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:41,070
file stuff like that I'm gonna show you
how to do some that too

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,130
on learned about the security told
myself from CL programming stuff like

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,770
that so

34
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,770
that's my experience and that's what I'm
gonna try to share with you because

35
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,140
again and a lot of people might not have
it so if you do get access to one

36
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,560
you know after this is all over with an
effing we go ahead the next

37
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,659
a slide is about down somebody the goals
of this

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,990
I want you to be able to recognize an
as/400 when you see a silly as it sounds

39
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,679
and a lot

40
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:05,659
say they have not seen an as/400 before
sort of show you what it looks like by

41
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,579
the screenshots and how to navigate

42
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,780
and somebody innovate interface tools
that you can use to

43
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,930
connect on as/400 I'm gonna talk about
telnet telnet emulation things like that

44
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,940
on from my eyes you in navigating get a
basic cut grass

45
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,870
of processing and this is the as/400
strong point very good

46
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,880
at following processing start to finish
in clear delineated steps

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,100
and that's something as I emphasize
towards the end and hopefully

48
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,180
by the initial be interested enough that
you will follow up for you want to

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,190
follow up anyway

50
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,250
and find out some more stuff about it so

51
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,380
buy into this I hope you feel more
comfortable and and

52
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,640
be able to find the answers on your own
if you have so what this

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,800
that also okay now again I mention it's
a very obscure machine it's not

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,900
something you can just go into Best Buy
higher fries or whatever your assorted

55
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,520
electronic stores are just buy one they
do make what they refer to as a baby 400

56
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,460
but even those are just

57
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,270
thousands and thousands of dollars so on
way again we don't have one to

58
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,400
demonstrate that's cool

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,250
om also discover general tips it's a big
folk all

60
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,520
if you ever refer to an as/400 as a
mainframe

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,030
it's not a mainframe it's a mid-range
system if you ever going to NAS from 100

62
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,660
shop

63
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,890
or a company that has an as/400 and call
it a mainframe

64
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,080
they're gonna call you a new and unless
you have the building so

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,560
don't call it a mainframe it's a
mid-range system but basically it's

66
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,330
it's similar to what I'm sure a lot of
people have extras like a sunny 10k its

67
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,470
long that caliber

68
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,580
machines a very powerful machine the 10k
15k

69
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,220
on so om it's along those lines as for
server and ask about that now

70
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,760
it runs OS four hundred natively that's
a proprietary operating system provided

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,959
by IBM and we're gonna focus mostly on
that

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,650
the new series of the as 400 which is
the I seriously e-series

73
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,100
we probably heard up they will run you
next they will run Linux nobody knows

74
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,670
IBM

75
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,070
you know it's been a pretty good with
their support for Linux which is very

76
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,310
cool on but we're going to focus on OS
four hundred

77
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,560
on that's what they run natively at very
expensive license

78
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,900
but along with that license they support
on

79
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,030
they come they give you all the support
they give you came the patches

80
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,900
updates the operating system and all
that kind of stuff so most companies

81
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,920
stay with that and go with that and and
I will show you how that is a very

82
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
robust system

83
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,930
I again big blue IBM expensive licensing

84
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,730
are constantly updating its you know
they they keep on top of that pretty

85
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,420
well

86
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,110
although I could tell stories after the
presentation how that doesn't always

87
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,230
work back

88
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,840
on and the way you access an as/400 is

89
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,610
to telnet now this is big misconceptions
like little pet peeve of mine that

90
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,460
people think

91
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,419
telnet is just tell tell it is not just
tell that there's different types of

92
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,510
emulation

93
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,590
that you need to connect two different
types of machine and the case of the

94
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,210
as/400 you have to be able to use 5250
emulation

95
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,719
so in Linux I don't know how you might
be familiar but there's something called

96
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,210
the T and fifty to fifty project

97
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,310
awning find that a SourceForge TN 5250
to SourceForge dotnet you can download

98
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,030
those packages and connect

99
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,430
on there's so many when does class that
is too numerous to mention obvious being

100
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,740
a

101
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,880
a corporate system they're all running
Windows for the most part so there's

102
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,050
tons of those is no point going into but

103
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,400
the check out TN 5250 it's a pretty good
pretty good

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,620
interface and

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,180
the sign on screen is missing

106
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,270
well their area sign on screen to get
the second calendar

107
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,500
sign on screen I say recognize it
recognize it

108
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,420
that is what a sign of strange when
as/400 looks like very simple

109
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,290
very obvious when you see this you can
know right away that you're looking in

110
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,320
as400

111
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,630
now the upper right hand corner to
protect the innocent or protect the

112
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,330
system that this came from and to
protect me

113
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,729
I blacked out the system name and you'll
see some stuff Florida occasionally

114
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,080
during the presentation

115
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,200
on but you'll notice there's a subsystem
there in a display

116
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,360
this is an when you sign on your
creating an interactive job just like

117
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,000
when you like

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,419
log onto any boxer working interactively
with the machine

119
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,310
so long keep that in mind and you'll
notice late on some the site you'll see

120
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,490
that you enter comeback in the name of
that

121
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,550
display om just kinda low in jail for
those of you do 400 to see that the user

122
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,440
name there

123
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,110
is to SEK officer IQ cite offer which is
a security officer pastor that's

124
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,650
equivalent

125
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,550
to ru doing it for 100 now are not
logged an excuse a cup run any

126
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,330
I am now go ahead and

127
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,090
somebody default users like I said uses
secure site offer which is the security

128
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,639
officer that is your route

129
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,169
that your your goal you always want to
get on a few sec offer

130
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,330
they're very tight about that as/400
shops IBM are really want you to have a

131
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,409
dedicated security officer

132
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,010
arm in every installation is what their
requirements want things they push for

133
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,409
the train and stuff like that have a
security officer

134
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,949
but by default and we all know the
defaulter where a lot of holes lotta

135
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:52,510
ways to get a system Texas

136
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,440
there's accuses opera which is a system
operator system operators

137
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,219
usually these boxes and maintain 24/7
round-the-clock they have an operator on

138
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,139
call

139
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,419
opera problem stuff like that and they
have a lot of authority to security

140
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,280
officers one who hands out roles

141
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,510
guess people authority the menus to
program stuff like that

142
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,590
but the system operator also has learned
to control

143
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,610
can manipulate jobs and jobs things like
that too so there's a lot of power

144
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,620
net to QP GMR this program that's like a
default program a role

145
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,720
programmer account that will bring up to
programming menu which again is gonna

146
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,650
come up with some screenshots them

147
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,990
om and that has a lot of power in it as
well but

148
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,290
usually surprisingly hot down the key
programmer cuz I guess they're scared

149
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,480
that the programmers

150
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,600
slash hackers might be able to
manipulate more things than actually

151
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,419
like that one down fairly well

152
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,049
and then be on the street are a couple
other their son mom

153
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,610
some system-level sign on 21 at hardware
stuff like that usually only used by the

154
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,760
IBM wraps if you want to head the come
out at hard drives are updates

155
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,810
a hardware things like that other than
that

156
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,560
everything's gonna be different from
installation to installation

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,500
one installations naming convention
maybe you know your last name to login

158
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,460
or whatever and that's

159
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,020
you know depends on when is it
installation to another and

160
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,400
those user names are going to be given
access based on whatever role

161
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,690
the security officer assigns so at the
security office for example so many

162
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,060
works then

163
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,240
I know the accounting office they may
only have access to log on I'll come

164
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,850
straight up to an accounting menu

165
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,919
something like that and they only have
access to certain things

166
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,210
well their intended only have access to
certain things

167
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,379
mom when you sign on each user has a
default menu that will usually come up

168
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,789
on for programmers you get a programmer
man you like I said in accounting

169
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,110
cashiering something like that they may
come directly up to a menu that

170
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,519
only gives them three options in a
printout invoices

171
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,220
purchase order something like that on
simplified forms navigation

172
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,740
and they're trying to limit you to only
the things that give you on that menu

173
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,550
what happens is they get kinda lazy
sometimes so the menu

174
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,339
will help give the options that they
want you to have access to

175
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,399
but you may have access to a lot more
and have some examples of that coming up

176
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,339
to

177
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,160
are no matter what man you start an on
it you can't command line access and you

178
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,379
know the name of menus

179
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,009
you start poking around in this is where
the fun of playing around as/400 seen

180
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,339
what you can find

181
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:15,949
well kinda old were gonna hold you can
find a system don't never

182
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:19,589
in general not even four hundred in
general never rely on menus

183
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:23,449
menus are just a pretty waited to done
things down you get a command line on

184
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:25,430
anything you can usually get a lot
farther

185
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,220
and just using that menus that try to
limit you only certain things

186
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,720
and to get to menus the as 400 use go
and in the menu name

187
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,800
general you can also execute them a few
kinda trick

188
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,939
check it out so on this is actually a
quick little

189
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:43,110
us a video that we're gonna play in your
head start

190
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,540
and this is basically just shows you
logging in shows you some basic menu

191
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,990
systems and again what you see

192
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,689
his sinus pain something we just showed
you meant

193
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:56,559
speech and then login we created schools
will count just to demonstrate for this

194
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,569
presentation so login here notice that
my first login

195
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:04,819
a menu system pops up immediately now
this menu

196
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:08,920
is customized to each individual log in
different roles assigned to different

197
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
usernames

198
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,179
as to what they can and cannot access
this particular account

199
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:18,910
access a fairly general menu that has
some operation stuff some programs

200
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,368
general access to it but for example

201
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:26,300
a typical user and say the cash hearing
officer something like that

202
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,860
when they log on they may be presented
with only options to the cashier

203
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,569
menu I can call that menu from this

204
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:37,389
location right here by pressing one or

205
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,480
I know the main the menu go directly to
it now I push one

206
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,809
it's going to take me to that menu a
user whose role

207
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:48,230
only allows them to access these
functions will come straight to this

208
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,249
menu when they signed

209
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,259
now this menu see right there at the
bottom

210
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:57,999
has its own password protection built
into it this is actually a package that

211
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,119
sits on top

212
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:04,290
100 not built into these undersell this
is simply a program that is call

213
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,748
now I'm gonna just log out at this sign
out at this now since this is a custom

214
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,410
menu it's got all

215
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,259
a bugger little the way this setup is
expects most users to go directly into

216
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:14,819
this one a sign of

217
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:18,878
will sign a completely off in the 400
that would be and I'm gonna go back

218
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,089
an analog and show you the very first
menu again

219
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,970
and noticed that also this particular
count has access to

220
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,189
a programmer's manual which is number
six on the screen and then this

221
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,719
organizer menu

222
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,800
and it tells you to the right the name
said menu

223
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,730
obviously I have control over access to
that menu so

224
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:43,350
I can either take option 40 which will
take me directly to it dispersed menu

225
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,749
automatically make that function call
this screen call for me the menu call

226
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,319
on but I F going back up to this main
menu and he's menu stacked the deeper

227
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:52,660
you go in there your stack

228
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,929
and you can always go backwards to
wherever you started off from come back

229
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:56,360
to this

230
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,569
originally before you sign but since I
obviously have access to that menu

231
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:03,709
not only can I type in 40 because I have
a command line here

232
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:08,029
I can type in goal and then the name but
the men use a PC OEM

233
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,670
and you and the exact same thing happens

234
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,488
obviously I had access to this menu so
it let me go through to this man

235
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:19,699
and the same thing with the program's I
can do

236
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,759
I can type in the command I can slip
option six for example

237
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,529
now a program I may come straight up to
this menu

238
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,920
have only access to this menu how this
is where you can I really need

239
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,238
think and stay with the thought process
hero

240
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:38,749
how how knowing where menus exist

241
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,069
knowing if men use existing is very very
important

242
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:45,290
mom you can see that from this menu here
which

243
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,899
don't worry about all the stuff on the
screen I know there's a lot not going

244
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,649
off again but one other things as the
program it does have

245
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,509
do have on the authority to run command
simple commands

246
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,989
so by putting five in to disperse man
you tell them to run a command and then

247
00:12:58,989 --> 00:13:03,980
going into this command it tells me
exactly what come and do I want to run

248
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,790
so I can go which is the as/400 command
I can go to that very first menu that

249
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,449
started up and I don't know if you
noticed in the upper left hand corner

250
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:17,629
it was called ATM me. in you even know
this program it does not have this on

251
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:20,119
their list

252
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:24,720
they can type in the command they know
the menu and have authority the menu

253
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,230
and BAM they're right back to the menu
so

254
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,439
you see here how you can keep going
around

255
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:35,498
and get through menu through menu
through menu

256
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,619
if you know the names now if they're
presented to you that's great you're

257
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,410
obviously suppose that access

258
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,829
but the problem is what if you know the
name of a menu

259
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:48,949
that's not on any of these less that
does not necessarily mean you don't have

260
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,429
authority to it you should not

261
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:55,429
but the problem is many many security
officers and system administrators

262
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:59,589
do not like the system's down tight now
so for example I know that there is a

263
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,989
menu on the system

264
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:04,179
call of me miss the menu for

265
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,949
use this opportunity use this
opportunity in town which is the system

266
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:08,069
operator

267
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:11,989
they go directly to this menu but this
account should not have any authority

268
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:15,549
whatsoever to go to that menu

269
00:14:15,549 --> 00:14:20,920
or does I just access that uses opera
menu even though I am NOT

270
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,579
log an excuse to stop which is a pretty
powerful account

271
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:27,619
on slavery operator as story to a lot of
things like

272
00:14:27,619 --> 00:14:32,689
see on the screen on starts in different
backups you can perform system startup

273
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,509
terminate programs

274
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,889
lots a powerful things that you can do
here om

275
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,489
from this menu and if you have access to
this manner

276
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:45,999
menu generally you have access to some
the functions within this menu for

277
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,429
example

278
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:51,429
cell also as I mentioned earlier these
menus back so you can see me jump

279
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:52,999
through menu through menu

280
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:57,509
I'm gonna heat keep it in command three
witches exit f3 is universal exit

281
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,350
command on many many

282
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,999
heavy metal machines but I had come in
three what you'll see as we will back up

283
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,699
through the entire process

284
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,860
back to this menu that I called to this
one

285
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,989
back to this the next one of course if
you're following along back roads will

286
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:13,799
be the programming menu

287
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,059
we're back here with the last command
that we call it even from there command

288
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:17,879
30 my time

289
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,309
this is actually where we started in the
first place

290
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:24,429
so even though this is the menu
presented to me and there's only a

291
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:25,170
couple other

292
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,339
or couple other menus that I have access
to

293
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:31,709
don't limit yourself to what you see its
classic

294
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,389
security through obscurity is the very
definition

295
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:39,959
from security through obscurity just
because you don't know the name

296
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,069
or don't have it placed in front you you
can still access

297
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:47,149
a whole lot of things on the as/400 just
by knowing

298
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,959
how it works and knowing where to find

299
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,089
I and now again I wish we had one here
that I could kinda talking demonstrate

300
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,999
as we go along but that's kinda the best
way to describe some that

301
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:03,489
but the real point that is a programmer
would have started directly in

302
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:06,809
that programmers menu and most
installations what you see

303
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:10,160
by knowing outside what's outside those
boundaries

304
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,399
you still can have a lot of already a
lot of access to that

305
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,989
on and execute things that you weren't
mentioned I could've log directly on SQP

306
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:18,059
GMR

307
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:21,429
started the program I menu and gone to
all those things you saw as well

308
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,179
and as far as knowing the name of
someone menus social engineering skills

309
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:26,170
come into play

310
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,459
shoulder surfing comes into play reading
manuals comes into play

311
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:32,029
everything's documented in companies
that you can find all this information

312
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,309
because

313
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:37,100
just like people right passwords on on
post it notes on the computer

314
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,369
people write documentation to have a
shot stored somewhere so

315
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:43,499
you can find a lot of that information
and their on

316
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:47,529
now as far as I said you know that's man
uses basic navigation to move around but

317
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,939
you don't want to be reliant on menus
you want to get used to using commands

318
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:54,839
and on the as/400 most commands not all
but most number based on three character

319
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,139
combinations

320
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:59,699
an in my opinion they can to make sense
they're kinda bobich

321
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:03,129
there so obvious in fact that I really
think you can guess a lot of

322
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:07,829
if you want to do some the stuff the SP
means display wrk work with in

323
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,819
et cetera et cetera you can combine
these three letter combinations it's not

324
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,869
just starting its

325
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,990
along the way in you can't completely
just mix and match to pee column A one

326
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,799
from column B

327
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:20,929
but in general you can create a lot of
man's going along their

328
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:25,120
display system status as an example you
can do a display system status you can't

329
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,740
system work status or something like
that but that's something again you get

330
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,279
used to and again help tells you a lot
about that

331
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,220
so just a few basic commands will get
you a long way and give you a lot about

332
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,299
access

333
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:39,100
to an as/400 and if you know program
aims

334
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,490
you can call this program names directly
using the call command

335
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,159
hand execute things again that may not
be in a man you're that you know the

336
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:50,630
name of the channel I various things
like that

337
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,880
so long you can get a command-line on
almost any system by

338
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,789
issuing call QC and you do call QC MD
they'll execute

339
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,950
standard command line which gives you

340
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,960
use of the bottom of some the menus if
you are set up with the role that has

341
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,360
the authority to command my nipple

342
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,269
be at the bottom of the menu people have
access a menu without a command line

343
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:11,470
just as easily

344
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,860
on but that's kinda you only get to see
one thing if you go to a call

345
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,100
you seen the look at the sea a list of
all your historical long

346
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:24,740
commands and things like that so it's a
little bit down little bit nicer

347
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,179
now on some the example coming up for
small

348
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:31,990
on access to them is limited by
authority whatever security officer

349
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,799
on gives your a authority to do so
getting access to higher account

350
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,049
on getting access to a different user
name something like that will give you

351
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,049
completely different or something else

352
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:46,918
however like any other system system in
general system is only secure

353
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,120
as its administrator is competent

354
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,169
anywhere anytime as/400 is no exception
to that

355
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:56,690
so long you'll find a lot of security
officers that are just in over their

356
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,289
head

357
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,980
and they don't bother putting proper
securities you know that's common sense

358
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,179
and you guys know that for any system
animals from the as/400

359
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,710
so I could you know same here there are
thousands upon thousands upon thousands

360
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,850
upon thousands of commands on the as/400

361
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,510
you can guess a lot of you can use to
help systems is no really no point going

362
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,549
through all of these

363
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:16,658
but these are some other some other very
common ones on

364
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:19,919
display job queue we're gonna go into
some these very the detail a few minutes

365
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,539
to

366
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,879
display job you work at job display at
you specifically

367
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,880
those are all on commands are going to
go into buried there

368
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,380
very and that for analysis in a few
minutes and

369
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,330
change user profile make sense CHG US
are perf

370
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:36,990
the changes are pro bono that's
something they usually don't have access

371
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,700
to anybody

372
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,450
mom now again we have

373
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,019
now %um

374
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:51,110
K a see here to help

375
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,789
the help has arm

376
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:57,970
is very robust very intuitive help
system that has it has come and

377
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,779
assumption

378
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:02,419
if you don't know the command if you
don't know how it's going to

379
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:06,880
mom how the command

380
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,370
finishes you know its display something
you type in DSP

381
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,480
aster and I'll bring up a menu and show
you all the commands

382
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,740
on that are following a system and the
FT's of people

383
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,889
you know take for granted lefties
overall use if you saw the bombing plot

384
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:23,490
a man you'll see that you can use those
FT's

385
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,559
for on help on on for other functions
that are built behind

386
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,039
so mom command assumption and

387
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,019
there are documentation IBM's famous for
its documentation

388
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:38,639
they document everything like to the
letter you can always find

389
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:44,519
documentation om shelves upon shells
books this that the show every step that

390
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,039
even so I was not computer proficient
can sit down follow directions profusely

391
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,700
every little detail love it arm and a
course like anything else you find a lot

392
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,139
of support online

393
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:57,389
on just two will Google search or
whatever your search engine of choice

394
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,580
happens to be

395
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,408
and next we have command line

396
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:07,919
and this is a some again this is a
little video

397
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,190
mom so ABS go ahead start this and
basically what this is happening

398
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,259
is this is just giving you a little
chemistry once again right

399
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:19,799
the main menu that you saw few seconds
ago and you see it's kinda cluttered up

400
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,529
because this menu is

401
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:25,299
got some programming behind it that will
basically execute this command to call

402
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:25,950
these

403
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:30,120
menus et cetera and sometimes you don't
want all that question

404
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,130
there is a screen that will give you
just plane command line now yes at

405
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,600
command-line access here

406
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,789
and it's pretty much universally you've
got to come and gone yet access to a

407
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:40,289
command-line

408
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,830
its gonna work no matter whether it's in
a menu or not but there is another

409
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,509
screen that I like

410
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,809
and you get to a bike doing call you see
in the

411
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,649
and this is just a dedicated command
entry and I like the kinda sit here and

412
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:53,559
idle

413
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:56,870
while meeting my system up because I
don't really need menus

414
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,610
and you probably should not be dependent
on menus for kinda the reasons I showed

415
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,130
you earlier you know more about you
don't become reliant on only what you

416
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,419
see

417
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:08,850
you get out mindset but it's also got
some other things are handy like Tom

418
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,910
will let you do multiple commands and do
them right here from the command line

419
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:18,120
and if there's something that you do
frequently you can always and I'm just

420
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,200
doing a couple command

421
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,850
just to show you what it looks like mom
you can also

422
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,630
start down change things together and if
it's something you do frequently

423
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,910
you can nom go back to anyone them very
easily

424
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,900
by hitting the f9 key and that the f9
key at the bottom the screen you'll see

425
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,980
says retreat

426
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,450
so by press f9 it will bring up the
previous command his again

427
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,540
it'll be the commander for that she
kinda runs up the screen here as I keep

428
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,690
eating at nine

429
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,880
ill keep going to the previous command
including

430
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,190
this system call them made earlier so
you do something repetitively you can

431
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,990
always do an F nine which is based like
the history

432
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,690
and unitary keep going back another
thing is if you don't

433
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,080
if its way up at the top a screen or
1020 I'll come and go you can just take

434
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,710
your cursor move directly up to the
command in question had at nine

435
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,940
and it will bring it right down and you
can just hit enter to read execute that

436
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,530
come and now this particular one just
shows you a little bit about the system

437
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,260
information so don't worry about that

438
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,660
but another thing I should point out is
this menu system down here at the bottom

439
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,700
every screen has this is standard on the
as/400

440
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,820
and they're fairly smart they know for
the most part what's green you are on

441
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,409
and it gives you options

442
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,150
are appropriate to that screen solely
move the cursor away here and

443
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,580
basically show you that like I said
before apt 3 is pretty universal on

444
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:38,929
every

445
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,170
for every screen f12 cancel something in
the middle %uh that's fine too f9

446
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,270
addition to retrieve

447
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:48,770
now going into every one of them is a
little overkill but f10 for example just

448
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,889
gives you a little bit more detail
information

449
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,060
on what run level that river crest level
runlevel everything was executed at

450
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,639
does the to and from there shows me a
little bit more information between all

451
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,820
those commands like what subsystem its
and like Tom

452
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,129
what on authorities you have what
libraries the programs are calling may

453
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:07,070
be in it cetera

454
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,310
so sometimes you want to turn that on
that can be handy if you're trying to

455
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,210
debug something

456
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,930
on f24 you see it there's too many
functions available on a menu the

457
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,240
F-twenty 40

458
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,970
which is your shift at 12 will take you
to

459
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,180
the rest of the options that are in
front you now again when I gotta go to

460
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,900
everyone about but kinda watches we go
to the rest the presentation you'll see

461
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,360
that they're different for every screen
depending on

462
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,740
what you're trying to do and one last
thing

463
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,150
to show you about the commanders to show
you how intelligent the command on the

464
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:37,750
system

465
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,090
I can do a workout cue command which
were gonna go into more detail about

466
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,810
later

467
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:48,370
i buy just hit enter it's basically like
executing a command on Linux or

468
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:50,180
something like that with the polls

469
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,250
it will work and it will do something
and basically the ball for this is to

470
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:54,980
show you

471
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,480
every all output queues well what you
can also do

472
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,310
is something called a prompt and if UCF
or propaganda that as a

473
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,649
very very important very powerful no
matter how much

474
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,640
you know the system and how much you get
memorized about it you'll always find

475
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,310
yourself popping like a man because you
can't know every single option

476
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,240
and what that means is when you put in
your command its it's a similar way if

477
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,810
you wanna think oven and Unix

478
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,620
as flax like if you want to do an LS

479
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,980
dash LS those to flags that you put on
there

480
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,960
the minus LS that you put on our tell it
to other things that you want that ls

481
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,830
command to do

482
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:37,250
we don't do flags on the as/400 what you
do is you prompted

483
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,640
and it will give you a list up all of
the other options that are available

484
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,760
to you or skew me to this particular
command so anything else that you would

485
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,140
want to fill in on such a command like I
said the default on this

486
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,210
star all I can easily say to only give
me

487
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,410
those cues that began with a zero are
seeing me in all and starving masters

488
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,460
being the wild-card

489
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,140
and leave the library blank which also
the also all

490
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,990
I can start looking only to specific
libraries I'm trying to isolate say a

491
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,810
job log or something like that

492
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,860
I can also change the up with the print
by default

493
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,910
it goes straight to the screen such as
it only all-star this time and it's only

494
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,080
gonna show me those two-out

495
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,500
used to begin with the letter O so this
is a simple command to show you but

496
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,920
there are a lot of other like for
example work we were to do something

497
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,440
like

498
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,770
change user profile this brings up

499
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,530
one option what is the name of the user
profile you want to change

500
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,450
we could put it in and impress f10 which
is additional parameters you see down

501
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,550
there and you'll see

502
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,100
all all the options that you have much
to do cue

503
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,860
sec offer here just for demonstration
purposes and paged through

504
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,550
all the different parameters that are
related see this could all be flags and

505
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,629
you to see how they could start

506
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,800
add up depending on what commander
working on so again we're not gonna go

507
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,430
to everyone these but you can tell

508
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,740
text description security officer you
can tell I've reruns to

509
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,170
what user class it is in this is like
roles like we talked about earlier

510
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,430
system operators Center and within each
one the

511
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,270
you can def for again to prophesy what
are the valid values that you can put in

512
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,430
these are the different roles that are
set up on the system

513
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:21,810
cell when I come and free after that it
tells me that at the end but

514
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,000
notice that has all these parameters on
their place 10

515
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,720
said doing them by Flagler positional I
can bring that coming back down here

516
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,580
and noticed that US RPR a these are
unique names

517
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,980
it when we asked for it will
automatically plug back in

518
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,310
any of these what any the ones that have
this right here next to it

519
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,300
it's something that we brought and and
if I ever wanted to bring that in myself

520
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,460
I know what those

521
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,880
him keywords are and I can type in LMT
CPB

522
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,240
star the same and I can do it all from
command line without prompting

523
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,900
but again are so many options on so many
commands

524
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,850
that it really gets kinda overkill at
some point so just get in the habit of

525
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,500
popping it get used to something a
repetitive commands

526
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,600
and you're doing a lot quicker from the
command line and of course if we have

527
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,610
three out of this command line which
remembers a separate screen

528
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:16,780
go back to our main menu and we're done

529
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,460
on now again I the changes a profile had
a hit enter

530
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,560
without done anything I did not have
authority that so

531
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,350
com but and again I know this is a lot
of dry technical journal that's kinda

532
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,240
why was trying to

533
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,330
keep it visual here because you're
seeing a lot of time and a lot of

534
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,360
options that

535
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,080
even people who worked on it for years
and years don't memorize and don't know

536
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,760
all those

537
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,180
but understand that by propping it you
can bring up all those options for all

538
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,110
those commands

539
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,840
and you can get help on each one of
those and things like that I just

540
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,250
understand how it works and how the
command line works

541
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,370
and then when you get on a system you
can play with it and get more

542
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,200
comfortable with it I just want to
demonstrate exactly how

543
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,870
and you have to worry about the details
on memorizing a lot other commands

544
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,630
themselves

545
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:02,630
now on this is the command assumption
which in go ahead

546
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:09,160
that play

547
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,950
now command assumptions were talking
about earlier if you don't know the

548
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,590
command

549
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:15,610
you can just type in the first three
letters like a man you want to display a

550
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,420
virgin oppose display writer display
printer

551
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,420
are made you want to display a log of
some sort you didn't know you too much

552
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,110
to the history loggers display

553
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:27,480
job was a display you not sure exactly
what watching do display

554
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,530
the SP star or any command but thats are
in there it'll automatically

555
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,800
fill out the rest have a Lucca may want
to come and assumption like a tad he

556
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,550
like a lot of

557
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,690
really in the habit of using but you can
at least get up a list

558
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,330
different ones this particular one ng
see their command is given to you

559
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:45,350
display job so that you could have tied
it indirectly

560
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,540
ESP jail be from the command line on
sewing or you could put the one next to

561
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:49,820
it

562
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,189
and executed it from this menu which is
often any party your ID and your when I

563
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,720
just typed the 12

564
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,170
to make a dollar further so you can come
back out here and type in any command

565
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:00,760
directly

566
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,340
om like the display log man and we're
going to talk about logging a lot but

567
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:09,020
let me just warn you upfront that
everything you do on as/400 and I mean

568
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,060
everything is logged on the has prided

569
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,580
area to reiterate that a lot more than
the the presentation

570
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,750
but everything is log so you can do a
display job you can do this play log

571
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,180
command and you'll see

572
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,270
all the stuff in here and all the steps
so mom

573
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,710
by using the command assumption again
that's another former help that's

574
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,720
another way that you can

575
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,190
learn to navigate on the system and
whether you do it through that menu or

576
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,450
do it by just typing and that

577
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,260
on on the next former help besides
command assumption

578
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,440
is context sensitive help on the next
slide if you on play this you can see

579
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,750
now again this is arm another way that
you can get help in as400 arm

580
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,200
let's say that you're on a screen that
you're not familiar with you don't know

581
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,340
it too well you don't know

582
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,800
bomb what a lot of these things mean
that are on the screen

583
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,780
om and again it if somebody who has
experience you probably know a lot this

584
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,600
but for the others

585
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,880
you see tight you don't know what type
of job that is that you see running

586
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,290
you go over there you put your cursor on
what you want to find out about

587
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,920
and the as/400 help is the most robust
robust touching on any system that ever

588
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,100
worked with you put your f1 key

589
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,320
which occurs to hit up one it'll bring
you up a list of all the possibilities

590
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,679
for that field

591
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,020
status was de- eww you have maybe not
even have a clue

592
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,050
you go over to it you can scroll down
through the list

593
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,379
right there'll be a description of what
the eww is

594
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,440
you can read up you can you not just and
an example and notice that that is tied

595
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,790
to this work at jobs menu so

596
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,360
every other menu anything provided by
as/400 has this built into it

597
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,550
go just about anywhere on the screen you
can now maximizes up

598
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,680
and fill the screen and the funny thing
is you can get help

599
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,360
on using the help so if you're inside
the help for that particular unit F one

600
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,370
again you get the help on how to read
the Help menu that you brought just

601
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:58,900
Prada

602
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,080
on you can go other places on the screen
you get general menu

603
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,199
help for the jet the whole menu itself
on

604
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,660
and on the left hand side for example
things like CPU percentage

605
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,910
on the subsystem a job name those our
installation appended their different

606
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,860
over actual

607
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,680
names that are assigned to jobs and
devices not gonna get help on something

608
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,360
like that

609
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,330
but you'll get help on what that column
is it'll tell you this is a list of job

610
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,090
names and they are going to change

611
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,200
from one installation to the other cell
whatever

612
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,460
naming convention they decided to use
that what you're gonna see them now

613
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,580
everybody's seen this sense your first

614
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,330
class and an high school their tickets
and preschool now I think it seems like

615
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,949
the good ol fashion and for processing
and output and that's as good as my

616
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:47,650
artistic skill guess I can draw squares
in line that's about it

617
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,300
but I mean we're not gonna you know I'm
not gonna talk down to me everybody

618
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,910
knows input processing an outlet

619
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,500
on input to take the form though of
feeling data files and passing

620
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,520
parameters to

621
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,400
to I am a programmer come and stuff like
that processing is actually working

622
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,240
on most heavy metal systems as/400 they
don't refer to them as programs your

623
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,010
column jobs jobs are running

624
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,370
on you see any network active jobs
payment when it goes out

625
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,900
it doesn't directly go to a printer
there's a queueing process

626
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,170
an I dot couldn't tell you exactly which
it

627
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,010
issue but i i had an article on 2600 it
was back to Merced interactive the

628
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,830
talked about

629
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,740
you know the difference is a need to and
how when you submit a print out there's

630
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,640
a split second

631
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,640
when you're actually submitting that
point out that it's cabinet member or

632
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,650
it's being cemented

633
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,430
the as/400 this is what's really good
about we're gonna go into some detail

634
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,030
this

635
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,450
one more kinda long videos gonna talk
about that but basically showing a clear

636
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,070
delineation 7 put

637
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:43,679
processing 1&2 began and the output goes
to an output queue in those cues can be

638
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,400
tied to whatever printer

639
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,490
and not to see that a couple seconds but
this is just the best demonstration

640
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,470
I wish they would show this as a
demonstration in schools and they teach

641
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,660
this because

642
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,670
he said memorizing this little this
little lamb diagram

643
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:03,160
so again metres interactive jobs on my
program crashes on the as/400 when a job

644
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,460
crashes they call a halt and a job sit
there sometimes

645
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,139
the the file that you're trying to write
to or read or something like that may be

646
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,239
locked by another user another program
is using that same file

647
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,030
it'll try a couple times access a file
then it'll locketts end up crashing

648
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,800
completely blue screen of death

649
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,510
spontaneously rebooting like some
operating systems do in a halt

650
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,530
and it'll prompt usually the system
operator that's why I'm on

651
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,580
24/7 on or the program obviously we'll
be monitoring the job hopefully

652
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,489
on can go in there read the air masses
by looking at the display job

653
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,680
commander showed earlier or you know
it's a lot different ways for that

654
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,440
on and see what the problem is why did
the job hauling maybe fixed and she

655
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,610
right and continue running again

656
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,640
so on just three steps

657
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,259
a input processing output in the as 400
represented by

658
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,490
the job queue for input you know but
something to a job you and that's where

659
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,010
sets before runs

660
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,290
when it runs a goes on the work at the
job screen when it's done it goes to an

661
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,060
output queue

662
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:03,460
now we do have bombed some screenshots
and the job queue

663
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,530
is think about is a library a
placeholder Cup whatever you wanna call

664
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:07,990
it

665
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,050
where your job gets a minute into and
again this varies from installations and

666
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:17,920
inflation what you see here kinda some
defaults on the come with EQ i nter

667
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,860
anybody remember that first sign on
screen up in the rain in corners and my

668
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,960
comeback

669
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,700
when you sign on your interactive job is
not show up under

670
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,490
its gonna shoot to the Q enter job queue
when you go to work at the job just see

671
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,450
it and go ahead to the next one is or
backup jobs mean I hope

672
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,410
and a half on the work at a job just see
under you enter

673
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,710
on the subsystem a job name you'll see
the name

674
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,890
those those subsystem a job names QP
eighty is just something it randomly

675
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,160
assigned to it

676
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,859
om and it'll show it that's the job name
of your interactive job your interactive

677
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,910
session again

678
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:56,180
batch job by default go to Q batch most
installations customize them put them in

679
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,220
different areas

680
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,450
on and it shows you the user name I'll
again I'll

681
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,640
can blur and it'll create a photo
shopping at blur out some user names

682
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,730
there so

683
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,900
com and you'll see this is another I did
actually put this in my notes must

684
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,030
for this of the hip you'll see the
function of the function right there

685
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,090
work active job man you can see a list
of all the jobs you can see that that

686
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,930
user

687
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,279
is running work at the job I wonder who
that could possibly be

688
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,880
you see someone else is running up mane
someone else is writing a PPR menu

689
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,760
if you know a menu name you might be
able to access it

690
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,000
I just found a man you name this is how
you find that kinda stuff back doorway

691
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,120
and other menus that

692
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,150
nobody told me that existed nobody knew
that existed but

693
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,710
I found out because you know the
architecture of the system

694
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,490
so after the active jobs your job runs
sometimes will be like that

695
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,440
quick job interactive jobs as long as
you're logged in your SSH into a box

696
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,890
you're in an interactive session

697
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:53,319
you tell led to an as/400 whatever your
log into a session to stay in the whole

698
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:53,950
time

699
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,600
may be on for hours at a time you submit
acquittal best shot to print something

700
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,540
in a shoe to the system like that

701
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,430
so when it does you generate some sort
about but there's a job log generated

702
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,330
for every job

703
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,290
that tells you everything that happened
in that job interactive abacha otherwise

704
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,250
or you can stand up right now all these
reforms about when they go into an

705
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,820
outtake you designated by

706
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:17,550
have your installation and setup on an
11-0 just one more long video coming up

707
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,790
in this love a technical and other than
that

708
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,520
com mostly this is on pretty
straightforward

709
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,660
on you'll see in these particular cue
names on their very firm installation

710
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,310
how many files are in there

711
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:33,330
that top one they a DM 0 wanna see the
753 files in that

712
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,370
that's something that prime guessing
that probably use

713
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,290
to they don't want a friend that may be
like job logs or crashes are some they

714
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,550
want to analyze later

715
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,180
it to save money up with you don't the
print everything you put in an out what

716
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,009
you want is there you can do a lot of
things with it so

717
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,760
om you can always go throughout but he's
a fine a lot of stuff

718
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,000
on the best thing to Joe fine for an
output queues and their

719
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,300
very solid putdown Bay reseller they put
proper security on output queues

720
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,410
om since you didn't just send this
intangible magic print job to a printer

721
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,060
you can actually go in there it's a pile
everything on the as/400 its

722
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,440
is an object and you can manipulate that
object however you want

723
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,570
in going to reformat that out but if you
want animus they can go into edit that

724
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,400
kinda stuff

725
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,810
you can copy it into a data file you can
use it as input to a second job have to

726
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,220
do this all kinds of stuff

727
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,880
or you can simply router 753 in a
particular cue

728
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,410
you want one to go to a printer you
going is like that one senate want to go

729
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,640
to your printer

730
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,339
it in their output queue which one to go
to your printer you know

731
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,570
just sayin I am

732
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:39,570
and daily print out if you want to
really be you know there's a lot of

733
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,460
stuff you can do it again

734
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,330
on and this is going to be a video now
this was kinda long and I know if

735
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,210
someone to drive this is the last video
like this I promise

736
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,060
this is gonna do those three screens
those three steps they just showed you

737
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:56,190
gonna walk you through that input
process and output on as/400 start

738
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,510
to finish so

739
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:03,090
okay now we're just talking about the
classic

740
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,350
a sequence of events that your talkn
even

741
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,650
high school or even earlier about basic
input processing and output

742
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:14,460
and the as/400 is one the most clear-cut
clean examples of that

743
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,760
someone to walk me through that quickly
on the as/400 now to save a little bit

744
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,620
I'm a break on hand typed in

745
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,880
some commands SPM job what to submit job
again the three letter combination: we

746
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,200
talked about earlier

747
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,470
on cement job commanded I've already
typed and either had prompted

748
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,180
show you the options basically what I've
done is I have chosen to submit a job in

749
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,649
that job years

750
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,150
whatever I put in here had a program
name output program a man here

751
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,600
whatever parameters the program requires
well I just went ahead and did the

752
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,080
display LogMeIn

753
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,049
which is justified man on I can profit
from within this prompted command

754
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,780
has everything as an object in
everything can just go deeper and deeper

755
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,950
om and I didn't really change anything
except say they were going to

756
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:01,580
print this out I'm gonna print all
available current time from history log

757
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,970
after going to the screen I'm gonna send
it to print and the job from that job

758
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:10,980
gonna tell it how to run where to run
and other details above how unwired

759
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,050
where the outputs gonna go it's at our
center sought named I'm job cost thanked

760
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:15,880
Sr in college

761
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,280
bank test although I don't know by just
for the heck other

762
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,010
because I've been playing around on the
others are out there so thank test five

763
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:28,160
I'm gonna cemented into job QQ bash
that's just a default

764
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,940
on this particular system all systems
are gonna bury the cube at is pretty

765
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,950
general I'm pretty much a standard

766
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,750
batch submission job queue and it's
already setup to feed to a certain

767
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,030
subsystem to run

768
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,550
as an acting job Obama gonna love it
further and again you can see how many

769
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,640
things are in use proper commands it's
just too many to remember

770
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,140
on I did create a special opportunity to
thank out cue

771
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,240
I summit created that earlier to make it
easier to find a route warmer over and

772
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,480
done with because

773
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,980
output tends to pile up on as/400 and
needs a lot to me

774
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,290
soda make sure reading it lost in the
shuffle with thousands of other print

775
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,390
out we put in a separate out here

776
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,759
and the only other thing I changed here
I'm gonna put the job

777
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,960
I'm gonna hold the job and the job
you're not gonna summit right away

778
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,270
I left this to know our to whatever the
job the fault one job description the

779
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,300
fault is

780
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,550
it would probably a shot of right away
and started running immediately

781
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,590
be done practically by the time I exited
out at the screen it's just that badass

782
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:29,700
so for demonstration purposes I'm gonna
put OnStar yes to hold this job

783
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,540
when I'm done with it so hit enter to
submit that job

784
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,130
and what you see here is that job its
assigned a number

785
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,690
named the user submitted the job and the
name on the job itself

786
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,340
tells you where was submitted what
library comes from so

787
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,530
everything about that job can be found
there

788
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,530
well I know that I submitted it to job
queue cue batch

789
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,590
some money use the command we talked
about earlier network job queue

790
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,640
an I could type Inc you back to go only
to that one the just

791
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,810
show you cuz and sauna for screen cue
badges right here and there to jobs in

792
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:05,220
there

793
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,220
probably one or I was playing on early
and went for a five to work with this

794
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:13,400
working with that job USD two things in
here I'm gonna go ahead and this one

795
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,700
that I was playing around with earlier

796
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:20,470
and confirm that and when I hit f5 to
refresh the screen it's gone

797
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,930
now this one I submit as hell and you'll
see status hell right there with me

798
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,180
did not launch right away I can put a
six next to this

799
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,089
and the moment I do that this job is
going to launch and begin to execute

800
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,660
so I've done that now now again this job
is very fast

801
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,330
very very quick but what happens to this
job is from the job queue

802
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:45,180
it goes into active processing now it's
already completed on force I'll have

803
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,690
something

804
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,850
handy that can take some time but work
actor job come and we talked about

805
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,029
earlier

806
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,380
this job would have launched out here
somewhere probably into

807
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,580
wanna the subsystems you bash which
matches the Q batch job you don't

808
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,710
confuse it is a separate area this is a
subsystem

809
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,010
and any job submitted will run on Dirk
you back to whatever the sign subsystem

810
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,220
happens to be

811
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,540
on my interactive jobs you at your runs
and Q&A

812
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:14,680
and as long as this job is active job in
this program whether it's my interactive

813
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,410
session

814
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:20,080
which is exactly what this is or a job
that I submitted via batch mode which I

815
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,410
just a second ago

816
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:24,980
that job is our tee shot through the
active job screen is already sitting on

817
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,320
the out cue

818
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,790
so we're going to work out cue and where
did I send it to a moment ago

819
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,950
something called stank out cue

820
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:36,160
so we're gonna go straight there and you
will see that there are some printouts

821
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,830
in stank out you I'm gonna go down to
the bottom one here is this is probably

822
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,000
why I just submitted

823
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,010
put a five next to it and their is the
output

824
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:48,290
from the job but I submitted the job
remember was

825
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:52,410
onto style of help and that was the
history law we saw that earlier on the

826
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,279
screen

827
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,040
well this time I cemented to output to a
print out for some reason to say I want

828
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,960
to look through it

829
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,180
security officer may print this off for
whatever reason they wanted look through

830
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,430
it

831
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:07,710
find somebody who's infiltrated their
system for example on

832
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,120
so anyway I printed this often sent it
to this output queue

833
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,920
Alice out a cute sitting there in a
ready status on it is

834
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,450
this output queue that I created I
created it because I have not assigned a

835
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,790
printer to it

836
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,730
I can assign a printer by IP address by
name said it up in the system

837
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:28,670
and this would have also could also
immediately fired up and printed off to

838
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,870
the local printer in my office if I set
it up that way some

839
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:36,069
check-writing by writing check programs
to print off people's paychecks or

840
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,800
purchase orders or something like that I
could send it over someone else's office

841
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,820
by IP address and remotely to wherever

842
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,110
and have it printed immediately well
that's the reason I created this out

843
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,750
you because I don't want this to print
anyway I don't need this to print

844
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:48,700
anywhere

845
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,600
so if you are so many jobs in a system
somewhere be careful that you don't just

846
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:52,960
start

847
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,200
throwing things around and they will
automatically print to default settings

848
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,560
and all of a sudden whatever you're
working on prints and security office

849
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,560
officers printer you could be in deep
trouble

850
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,560
so what I'm going to do is delete these
to pronounce

851
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,850
because they were just for demonstrates
purpose you see this document now

852
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:13,500
empty again lot you can look

853
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,700
at the workout you command with no
parameters and just look at all of them

854
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,150
and you can just see

855
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:21,500
all the files that could possibly be
backed up

856
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,690
282 here to there these are all the
different printers that are set up

857
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:29,350
within this company these are names and
cues and writers assign

858
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,319
arbitrary whatever they naming
convention they decide to use with the

859
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,180
system

860
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,089
96 here and there on then you can see
that they get caught up in these Q's

861
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,260
either intentionally or unintentionally

862
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,970
and on as/400 operator sometimes have to
go in there could be a paper jam in

863
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:44,720
their block

864
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,820
backed up printer could have run out of
paper they may want them saved in here

865
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,330
this one for example

866
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,549
is an outcast 50 files in it but there's
no writer start

867
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,640
writer failed to curb in any number of
reasons

868
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,350
lights on the best stuff but you may
find in here is by scrolling through

869
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,690
this output UN and look at something
like this

870
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,270
you have 2000 jobs in this output queue

871
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:10,090
2500 in this one and when you start
scrolling through them

872
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:13,850
look at this the higher learning there
but we take a look at this

873
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:18,770
is a purchase order 150 dollars spent
for instructional video tape

874
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:24,020
chain ha safety you find a really fun
and interesting study go looking for it

875
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,600
and

876
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:28,040
this is something that we really
shouldn't at the system setup properly

877
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,850
properly have access to look at
something like this but here I am

878
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,500
looking at thousands of dollars worth of
invoices and purchase orders

879
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,890
because in the way the system is set up
so I can scroll down through here and

880
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,810
you'll find

881
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:42,790
paycheck information you'll find all
kinds of interesting stuff

882
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,960
on that if this again set up properly
you should never ever see but

883
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,680
majority the time you will find this
summer the best information you'll have

884
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,210
to

885
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,330
a lot of stuff we showed you earlier
great and I hope you understand a lot of

886
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,720
it but if nothing else

887
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,050
you can get into output queues you may
find yourself with a welcome information

888
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,630
you'll have to submit jobs

889
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:05,380
you don't have to write a program or
inject

890
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,940
a command or anything like that are
creating your own setup

891
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,250
those programs they are to be created in
all you gotta do is go on a rant

892
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:17,130
fine that output at their checks that
are printed going to a special check

893
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,320
printer they can have all the security
in the world

894
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,480
I did on that point on they can have
stamps and barcodes on it

895
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,170
watermarks the signatures and everything
but if you can go right here to this

896
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,850
output and see exactly what's coming out
a bit

897
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:34,470
it kinda defeats the purpose so anyway
you see

898
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:39,540
3 clear levels are input on that job
queue when you submit a job

899
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,470
you see the active job itself with the
Work Act job stream that runs in the

900
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:45,820
subsystem that's a long-running job

901
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:50,440
and I've had jobs the run for hours upon
hours upon hours compile stuff like that

902
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,670
the just run hours and hours and you can
watch you can see if there were a

903
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,930
research job holzer something like that
but you need to answer and they have a

904
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,370
lock on object

905
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:01,779
you see that at Work Act job screen and
when the job is finished

906
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,960
and complete an successfully it goes to
whatever out to you

907
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,550
set up to go to for my example I didn't
want print anywhere I just wanted to sit

908
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:13,130
in up fake out you and so that I can
browse

909
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,760
I wanted to print I will sign it to a
printer et cetera so you see those

910
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,590
3 clear delineation sup every step
process

911
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,200
so when they teach you that in school
and when you've seen that every textbook

912
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,600
there is a reason for it and it makes
perfect sense in a few do understand

913
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,540
where this clear delineation czar

914
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,910
you can take advantage exactly what
which ones used for and you can see

915
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,710
the holes in the chinks in the armor so
to speak so make sure you at least

916
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,710
remember that take that from this

917
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,910
from this presentation if nothing else

918
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,970
mom I don't know who was talking that
thing about the checks that

919
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,990
I don't know how to get indicted on

920
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:54,270
but thats very very very very true

921
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,450
I had no idea what I was going to find
when I was in there

922
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,900
I had a blur that out for obvious
reasons

923
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,020
I did not make up there was an invoice
for a video on chain saw safety

924
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,020
no 129 bucks income expenses but arm

925
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,210
but you you find weird stuff like that
that's that's what you'll

926
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:15,390
you'll stop across the reason I blurted
out was not because the chainsaw but

927
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:16,150
because

928
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:21,120
also in that data that again they'd I'm
certainly didn't want me to see

929
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,049
name address phone numbers account
numbers

930
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,800
the name of the items prices all that
wasn't a purchase order sitting in an

931
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,020
out cue

932
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,320
that I'm certain they don't want people
to see so

933
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,220
you find a lot of that stuff like that
now that's the last video like that I

934
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,060
promise

935
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,430
arm I said earlier I'm gonna emphasize
this at the end and I'm gonna show you

936
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,549
go and play this this is

937
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,350
demonstrating a showing you that
everything I showed you

938
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,700
that's all well and good but everything
that you do

939
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,360
on the age four hundred is law
everything look at

940
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:01,570
the precision how close point zero zero
one second 100 three seconds

941
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:05,320
you get job numbers you get the username
you get the job name

942
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,080
tell you what subsystem it was an you
see everything that's happened everybody

943
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,040
that's connected to the system

944
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,370
so be careful keep that in mind doesn't
mean you can't go out there

945
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,759
you know after this presentation go
haxor the Gibson or whatever you know

946
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,650
ok Act or the eighth as/400 not you're
not gonna be able to do that and

947
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:26,120
I up front I said that someone the goals
is to believe familiarize you

948
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,890
but how this works you can go I was
hitting up one on there as I was joking

949
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,480
around

950
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,340
and you can see the detail on that job
once you have the job number:

951
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,300
see the job number right there you can
then go into the individual job log that

952
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,960
was just the history log who did what
when and where

953
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,070
you can go to the individual job log
number ten right there

954
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:48,150
and you can see everything that happen

955
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,990
from that user or by that job everything
that you did

956
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:55,090
and if you kinda see that that's a job
log

957
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:59,070
I made while generating somebody's pres
videos and presentations will see the

958
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,210
commands that I did

959
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:04,120
so every single thing will be found

960
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,589
if they go looking for people let them
get looking for

961
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:12,850
so again this was to familiarize you
with that

962
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:16,930
and kinda as a summary here just say
that I wanted you to

963
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:20,360
a recognize a system you saw the sign on
screen very distinct

964
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,200
very distinctive sign on screen menu
systems which

965
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,710
how much is there to understanding a
menu but understand commands behind them

966
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:28,880
commander just executors

967
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,410
menus are just executing commands so
understand that and understand it you

968
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:35,080
can go directly to the command is much
better to do that

969
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,970
on to to explain the connectivity in the
software use

970
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,080
5250 telnet emulation again I'll be glad

971
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,690
re give you the URL but its source for
Stan 5250 to SourceForge

972
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,490
for the Linux client in Windows just
searchers a billion other men

973
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,590
most optimistic but on

974
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,700
mattresses interactive processing I got
show joined work active Josh Green you

975
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,470
were seeing menu names that you might

976
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:01,700
write-down you might use later go nosing
into on

977
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,280
you might be able to look at the job log
all that interactive job

978
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,280
see what that person is doing live while
their login

979
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,450
not what did what you saw on their work
after jobs that snapshot what are they

980
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,040
doing right then you can keep refreshing
and watch it

981
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,930
you if you have access to go get a job
log in see everything they've been doing

982
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,100
just like I looked in my own historical
job log on that

983
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,270
so our menus in command lines very
important and again

984
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,030
every thing log don't do anything stupid

985
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:29,810
should be doing anything to do with this
is about learning the as/400 and

986
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,180
learning how to navigate

987
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:35,130
and hopefully when you sit down at one
of these after watching this

988
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:39,210
on then you can actually have the skills
that they don't teach you in school

989
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,490
that usually learn on the job you can
sit down hopefully and

990
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:46,080
jump into an as/400 out of somebody
actually at this point experience

991
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,380
you can sit down and you can confidently
say not this really is the fundamentals

992
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,200
other

993
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,400
even the best people have been working a
sponsor for years don't memorize all

994
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,740
those commands

995
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,730
and the profit one of many command has
50 flags and fifty different things that

996
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,080
you can change on it

997
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,609
even the best don't know that so you are
right there after this presentation

998
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:08,529
really you know enough undermount about
the as/400 probably more so than a lot

999
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:09,330
of people

1000
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,920
that are professionals and so that's
really all there is the it to it

1001
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:19,350
on thank everybody from FL 2600 my local
