1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:03,540
some accounts they charge me with that I
was merely sent

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,310
certain information by outside parties
exploratory evidence

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,849
so the government argued to the judge
that we believe that mister mitnick

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,219
might have some national

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:17,439
security information that some cryptic
we

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,859
believe that you should provide the key
and what He gives us the key

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:27,070
to that material well give him all the
discovery the attorneys thinking about

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,710
ago I got my turning no no no no no I'm
not giving up by PGP k sorry

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:36,370
so at the end to the day that the judge
was interested in the issue was a novel

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,199
issue at the time

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,110
can be for someone I to give up their
right against self-incrimination in

12
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,990
exchange for getting access to the
evidence

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,230
for fair enough affair a fair trial the
judge basically said

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,580
mister mitnick's very clever in a
cryptic in cutting-edge materials unless

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,949
he gives the government the key

16
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:57,940
I'm not going to order the government to
turn over the discover to make a long

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,180
story short

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,460
after about four and a half years over
fighting the case

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,660
the government approach my attorney and
said listen

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,030
if your client wins at trial

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,270
where we're going to do is we're gonna
pull on the bus I got my worker what's

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:14,979
the bus

23
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,970
because the buses where they just simply
put on a bus to another federal

24
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,870
jurisdiction

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:24,520
the face more charges ago how can they
do that that's double jeopardy no no no

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:24,880
no no

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,100
me explain to me they don't charge you
with all the possible counts if you do

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,180
if you happen to one system but you make
by phone calls

29
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,210
across state lines to do it that's five
different counts

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,520
they could indict you you're the
terminating pointer the origination

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,140
point

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,479
so they can do it so it's basically

33
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,640
given a choice an offer I can't refuse
accept the government's offer

34
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,500
or go through a revolving door trials if
you accept the government's offer you'll

35
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,690
be out in 10 months

36
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,970
if you don't accept the government's
offer will be no light

37
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,170
at the end of the tunnel so I decided

38
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,070
in 1999 the finally accept the
government's offer

39
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,360
well people ask me what what was prison
like

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,230
well to sum it up it was boring

41
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,099
it was depressing wasn't dangerous like
you'll see other movie like america me

42
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,290
because I wasn't federal custody arm

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,099
but ice it was like a helpless feeling
if not

44
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,209
knowing what's going to happen with your
future for years

45
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,079
I'm not like that months for days or
weeks but for years basically serving a

46
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,260
federal prison sentence

47
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,659
before you're even convicted basis spend
most of my time

48
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,858
in the law library trying to find cases

49
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,189
to assist my lawyer my lawyer was a
publicly appointed attorney

50
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:48,099
so what time was very limited our talk
to friends I talk to my family

51
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,048
I talk to different lawyers I talk to
supporters which brings me to the free

52
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:52,849
cover

53
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,179
is well I have a greater

54
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,840
deep gratitude for everyone who should
we support

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,879
over the years I mean I used to get all
letters

56
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,768
even got to the point where do I get so
much mail that they would have to print

57
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:08,450
it out

58
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,760
friends with print out the email and
send it to me in custody

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,059
and then what would happen is that
person won't allow me to receive this

60
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:15,609
male

61
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:19,340
because they thought it was written in
secret hope

62
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,389
so I try to fight with the secret code
is and they would see the MIME headers

63
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,040
you sending a mine complain message to a
non-compliant 0

64
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,150
Weimer a non her

65
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,069
to to a non compliance system

66
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,650
they see the miners and they go oh this
a secret code we can't let that happen

67
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,209
so the Freak element really

68
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,719
help me besides my family help me get
through this

69
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,019
up very tough time in my life not
knowing what was going to happen to me

70
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,529
II was you know pretty scared because
uva

71
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:56,870
the the

72
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,980
the rumors and I'll the the Miss that
were created a

73
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,680
about me in the press notice I'm not
gonna get really into john markoff

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,849
during this talk because I think
everybody's heard it

75
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,999
and they can go and read by my by

76
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:13,779
up for bid in chapter on the Internet
ready 1801 funny story that happened at

77
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,799
present kinda funny now but wasn't funny
then

78
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,940
up the law library as I did every time I
can get

79
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,770
time in the law library go down in look
at cases to assist by

80
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,289
in my defense it was taken back up to
the housing unit

81
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:31,780
and they won't let me in and I see that
they're taking everything out of my room

82
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,379
and their packing everything up and I go
what's going on ago you're going to

83
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:38,690
Whole

84
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,909
going to hope for your security threat

85
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:45,469
and in my cell they found contraband

86
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,780
after they decided the searching for the
security threat the film 74 canned tuna

87
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,050
weren't allowed to have a these metal
cans because you can take it in

88
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,440
is it is showing but I use the you know

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,889
by the scans from the sentence inmates
and you're not allowed to have one can

90
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,669
but I can see all the scams like in Ritz
cracker box in pop tart boxes

91
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,448
they're all there in front of them but
so much in front of them and never saw

92
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,500
them

93
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,620
but if they found them they were just
take them so

94
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,949
at first they said 0 we talk to a
contraband

95
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,930
then eventually when I turn you got to
the bottom of it this was work happening

96
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,889
in the actually talk to the warden's
assistant

97
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,370
and the warden's assistant all the
weather recently for mister mitnick in

98
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,169
solitary

99
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:30,469
I was in there for another week was
because we have information

100
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,659
though there we thought he was going to
modify his a.m.

101
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:37,659
after FM Walkman radio to become a
transmitter

102
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:40,879
and bug the warden's office

103
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,409
now the warden's office was outside the
security perimeter

104
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:49,419
the present so I would actually at the
breakout

105
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:53,520
plant the bug go back into prison

106
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,318
over really takes the cake is there was
a group up from 2600 back using that

107
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,969
came out the picket in front of the
present

108
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:05,139
right in a burly a pic free Kevin banner
and

109
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,750
somebody was bold enough to take a free
Kevin bumper-sticker

110
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,310
in sticking on the glass outside the
prison to the one at the doors

111
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,150
so later on that night is like four
lieutenants

112
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:24,150
come to the room in the Parchin how did
you do it

113
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,460
are billion I

114
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:37,010
these guys watch too much work I ever

115
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,580
stock a little bit about the

116
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,070
the federal sentencing guidelines no
bebe repair years

117
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,139
the Los that I allegedly caused

118
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,060
a lot about victims was really
exaggerated by the federal government

119
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,870
because

120
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,910
to really make me an example give me the
longest prison sentence possible

121
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,040
that loss the amount of damages that our
cause

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,320
largely reflect what type a sentence a
personal get

123
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,699
so what the FBI did as they solicited

124
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,600
the companies that were involved in my
case to

125
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,389
say that I cause the law succeeding at
least eighty million dollars in each

126
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:16,039
case

127
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,409
those lost letters were eventually
published by 2600 magazine

128
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,199
and the prosecutors were so upset that
they

129
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,630
try to get the judge the whole by
attorney in contempt of court

130
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,699
for releasing this information but the

131
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,510
pretty much the beans were spilled in
there is nothing they can do and what

132
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,340
they did

133
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,070
with the government's there is because
over attorneys also have arguments

134
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,110
so they want to come up with a theory or
argument

135
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,630
to convince a federal court judge that I
cause is atrocious lawsuits

136
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,719
and the only way they were able to do it
is what I did is I got into a lot of

137
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,690
different companies a

138
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,680
developed your operating systems are so
close and what I would do that look at

139
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,349
the source code

140
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,919
because if you remember in the beginning
a by talk I was interested in becoming

141
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,969
the best at circumventing security

142
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,130
and I want to look at the source so

143
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,169
what the theory the government used was
nobody can by the source code

144
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:16,198
it was that the company's crown jewels
even though Kevin did distribute it sell

145
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:16,449
it

146
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,960
or intend to use it he still looked at
it and so

147
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,449
we believe that companies like motorola
companies like novell

148
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,099
companies like STI have lost their
initial

149
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,639
R&D investment in the source right

150
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,969
for me just looking at it it's like were
getting

151
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:38,630
a pirated copy a a Steven Spielberg
movie before it's released in watching

152
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,330
it 0

153
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,570
you know you're responsible for millions
of dollars that it took to make the

154
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,000
movie

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,780
and what ended up happening

156
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,970
is in signing my plea agreement I just
said

157
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,170
II cause a loss between five and ten
million dollars just to settle the case

158
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,890
the government said in the press
releases that exceeded $300 million

159
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,480
dollars

160
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,790
at the end of the day the restitution

161
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,199
it I had to pay back was four thousand
one hundred and twenty-five dollars

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,920
the loss was four thousand one hundred
twenty-five dollars

163
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,479
I would serve no prison time on the
sentencing guidelines

164
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,000
so rather interesting

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,800
issue at the Los is all the companies
that were involved in my case

166
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,089
were publicly traded corporations and
under

167
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,839
rule 12g security and Exchange
Commission

168
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,350
anytime a business offers a material
loss you have to report your shoulders

169
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,720
so they could make best decisions on
whether they want to continue investing

170
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,690
in your company

171
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,760
so my defense team hold the 10 case in
10 Q's

172
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,069
a research a research company

173
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:54,329
research their their public a public of
the public offerings but public

174
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:57,910
disclosures thoroughly not one of these
companies

175
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,719
however attributed any loss to me and
there's in there are

176
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,480
10 case or 10 Q's so I was quite kind of
interesting so

177
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,400
always like the old Wendy's slogan like
where's the beef

178
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,180
in the truth of the matter is I'm sure
my activities did cause some these

179
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,410
companies some lost

180
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,569
I don't know what that number was I
don't think it even approaches anywhere

181
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,230
near

182
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,480
a half a million dollars but I should've
been

183
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,520
by organization punished bases on the
actual losses that I caused.

184
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,589
rather than these fictitious numbers
that the government

185
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,130
try to bandy about to put me in prison
for as long as possible

186
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,250
because I was the terror I was the guy

187
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,360
depend upon the cross to the tear all
the view

188
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,440
from hacking so what

189
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,959
i jus wanna go over really quick what
are the by by lessons learned

190
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,290
from my my experience

191
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,969
what lesson learned is

192
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,680
I know carries here in the audience is
by webmaster

193
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,209
is you don't ask your webmaster to pull
the judges financial records

194
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:08,280
to find out if she was a shareholder in
any the company said you were indicted

195
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,510
what happens when the actual pic or

196
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,900
and I a bright idea go well discharge
really

197
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,030
hates me so let's try to get our of the
case

198
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,800
thinking well a lot of companies are
big-name companies a republic a so she's

199
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,819
invested

200
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:26,969
any she had any stock her husband has
any stock

201
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,280
I can get off my case brilliant idea
right wrong

202
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,500
what happened as the federal judiciary
reported to the judge

203
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,250
that somebody from 2600 magazine
requester financials

204
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,430
so when I showed up in court that day
she was more than a little

205
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,650
there was a big surprise to me right
some in court she goes

206
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,990
missed a round of boos 2600 that I i
dont think im

207
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:54,110
what what happened and she goes she told
the story that somebody had requester

208
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,380
financials

209
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,480
she thinks that I'm behind it

210
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,850
and anything happens to her

211
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,980
credit rating for financial standing in
the community

212
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,180
that mister big dick is somehow involved

213
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,670
bad thing to piss off her sentencing
judge not good

214
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,870
total next thing

215
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,110
FBI has no sense of humor

216
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,330
not at all in fact what they are kind
thing I remember I

217
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,260
said about the forgetting the phone
getting a phone number

218
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,580
that one phone number that belong to the
undercover agent Joseph ways

219
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,690
is what I started doing as I started
pulling

220
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,430
not only the bills for that telephone
number

221
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,260
but every number that call decide their
phones that work all

222
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,490
I also call those bills and I was able

223
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,340
to determine the cell phone number I've
ever agents on the white collar

224
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,480
the white collar crime squad number
three in a lot the LA bureau

225
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,520
actually had pins on a map but there is
a better phone numbers

226
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,689
but I bought this device called the DDR
from

227
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,090
this guy mark in milwaukee what is TDI
devices you attach it to your computer

228
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:09,440
any could barter the forward control
channel up the cell sites in your area

229
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,960
so why didn't they programmed all the
FBI agent's phone numbers

230
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,120
in this little or software configuration
menu so anytime there's agence

231
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,310
would be in the area they have a room
you know your punk goes in the area

232
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,050
registers

233
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,430
I see register what about working under
PPP bbbbbb

234
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,820
I go look at this venue know it requires
a red

235
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,510
I up well even tone it when it comes to
purchasing a couple days cuz its

236
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,319
only reason he's here but for Yap

237
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,500
got a 120 thing about the searchers a I
was really really tired

238
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,350
this wasn't done on purpose in two days
later after bbbbb

239
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,210
the first i got really they're all the
contraband that I I and

240
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,440
but six in the morning somebody's trying
my door

241
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,810
no don't knock just trying to like a key
trying to get in

242
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,160
in like immediately just reactive

243
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,150
I get outta bed let's let's leaked nude
for all your interest

244
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,310
and her

245
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:17,440
but I opened the door and is a female
FBI did say that all I want to help you

246
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,000
I yep

247
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,690
I I wasn't even thinking I was wearing
anything cuz I was so like shocked

248
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,880
they've ever realize a girl to a
proposal

249
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,010
but up

250
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,430
a bar journey through this offer

251
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,060
to the beers I guess or through the the
justice system in my experiences

252
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,670
love no I kinda was a hacker for the
sheer entertainment value

253
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,120
in the quest for knowledge the pursuit
over

254
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,170
the pursuit of knowledge the
intellectual challenge the thriller

255
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,290
being somewhere really really shouldn't
be

256
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,620
have like exploring an abandoned house
on the corner when you're not allowed to

257
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,380
go there

258
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,130
that was kinda by my answer back in the
early days hacking was a lot

259
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,850
well is looking a dynamic here hacking
in some respects was easier

260
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,280
in some respects harder arm back then

261
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,000
there was no tools you don't have
necessary didn't have

262
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,200
and map you don't have a lot of these
tools that you can use to

263
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,480
you know possibly compromise a system he
did everything by hand

264
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,040
back at those a security was really
locks

265
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,420
no security is really the afterthought
people really

266
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,459
reactive instead a proactive so what's
changed today

267
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,459
is you don't even have to know

268
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,440
how these exploits or how to analyze a
system really works under the hood

269
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,839
you can go down though the tools that
are prepackaged for you all you have to

270
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,089
do is no had a point-and-click

271
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,459
Gordon IP addresses in some cases but
the same time

272
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:53,780
it's a little bit harder because
businesses government agencies

273
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,839
in educational institutions are where a
security threat so they try to raise the

274
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,540
bar

275
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,300
right and I want to encourage you know
all of you out there the

276
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,470
not to follow in my footsteps I think
I'm extremely lucky

277
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,690
to be honored enough to stand here
before you all in addressing arm

278
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,020
I i kinda you know it's kinda
unbelievable like

279
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:19,790
no at the last hope I was on supervised
release I can even tighter

280
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,930
fax machine without permission the one
before that I was in federal prison

281
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,880
for ready three years the one before
that I was a fugitive right

282
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,170
and the path a turk isn't the path to
take so

283
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,860
we as hackers by two side we want to
compromise a system because it's fun

284
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,380
but unfortunately the person on the
other side to that attack doesn't know

285
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,410
your intentions

286
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,000
and they freak out they spend a lot of
money in time trying to figure out who

287
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,320
you are what you did

288
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,400
enough to keep you out at the end of the
day you are costing somebody some cash

289
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,020
that's not a good thing

290
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,709
today looking at the same excitement the
same for real

291
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,740
the pursuit of knowledge same throat
being sore you shouldn't really be

292
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,089
arm in the in the pursuit of knowledge

293
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,448
legally by being a factor for heart

294
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,919
now you can take your skills and be a
pen tester to security assessments

295
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,500
course your permission well at times the
persnickety permission they won't tell

296
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,970
anybody else in the organization that
you're testing

297
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,429
see still get that like mission
impossible type attack scenario

298
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:25,750
so the motto is rather than the

299
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,370
you know hack impossibly

300
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,690
affect your life in a negative way an
end up serving some time ago hacking

301
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,600
away

302
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,510
that socially productive and where
you're in some money at the end of the

303
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,760
day

304
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,860
the one thing I do want to say before
closing as hell

305
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,260
I found myself I think this position is
back when I was in high school

306
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,550
remember I got a for writing II got in a
day

307
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,570
for writing a program at school the
teachers password

308
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,570
today P did the same thing to be expel
so back in my day they didn't eat any

309
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,270
computer ethics

310
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,110
that XA it was a it was okay you're
considered to be the whiz kid

311
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,320
for the gifted person or the genius

312
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,840
if you can do these types of things this
phone freaking typeof activities in this

313
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,860
hacking type stuff

314
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,090
and you're given the other boys are the
pats on the back

315
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,360
so back in my day maybe a

316
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,620
they had an ethics program where the
instructors at school talk

317
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,669
some computer ethics maybe I would have
taken a different path

318
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:31,550
there's another well-known speaker who

319
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,720
speaks on issues of security mainly
check fraud

320
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,100
and this company did a survey up all the
different high schools throughout the

321
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,080
country

322
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,340
and asked the question to high school
students is it okay

323
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,610
to break into your fellow students a
carer this was recently done in 40

324
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,460
percent said yes

325
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,550
it's okay so people are that mindset
well help people are going to continue

326
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,840
to hack

327
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,810
so maybe it's an it's a question about
pics

328
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,460
I wanna go ahead and leave some time for
open Q&A it up to speak up because a

329
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,669
a little bit hard of hearing because
when I was in prison for those four and

330
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:10,530
a half years I use least listen to my
Walkman all the time

331
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,500
nice to crank up the music to escape the

332
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,030
to escape the physical placed that I was
and I think this period hearing a little

333
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,360
bit

334
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,419
so I want to thank everybody for a being
here today once again I want to

335
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,750
especially thank emmanuel goldstein

336
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,350

be at my first pope

337
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,840

because I brought

338
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,449
presence I think they're back there
picking about four o'clock or buy books

339
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,950

349
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:25,658
me think

350
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:32,309
for

351
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:35,460
what's the first i saw this on my talk

all very right there come under go

355
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,120
alright with a question mark

356
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,610
when the last time I checked in your
system no

357
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,679

358
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,140

well mister saw couple I alright

374
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,240
sigh I'm going to open up the Q&A

375
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,840
and to feel free to ask any question you
would like in

376
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,928
the you're probably gonna come up to the
microphone so I could hear your

377
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:38,929
and I'm here not answer any questions
you may have the microphone to work

378
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,159
okay Kevin do you see any technological
solution to the

379
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,090
social engineering problems we can i
dont work on system something we can do

380
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,590
using this technology to stop it well

381
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,110
the question I asked the question is is
there any technology that concert can

382
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,440
stop social engineering

383
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,149
the only I look at it more like a a
defense in depth

384
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:05,289
thing like for instance social
engineering attack is to send

385
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:09,658
a target like for example attachment
contain some malicious code

386
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,360
so they're running some TV software the
catch is it after their

387
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,710
after they follow through on the attack

388
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,200
in that might stop the attack from
succeeding she got a B soccer

389
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,860
the other issues as design a lot a
customer service

390
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,190
centers could look up by the customer
information how they verify the large by

391
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,799
asking

392
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,860
a password or social security number
mother's maiden name

393
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,120
what times the rep to see their right on
the screen it opens a

394
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,559
it creates a target rich environment
where you can trick the rap

395
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,830
into revealing information so if they
designed a system that a customer call

396
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,350
then

397
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,260
the rep ask for your password was and
the rep had a kid in the system

398
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,350
actually that the comparison their
create a more secure environment so

399
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,570
that's another area with the technology
could be used

400
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,379
thank you iraq come up to the mike

401
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,419
if you wanna ask any questions a Kevin

402
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:10,179
glad to see the you made it out I hope
this doesn't get you into trouble or

403
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,639
anything but could you with all that
that that whole nope thing for us here

404
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:16,700
the first

405
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,289
I'll

406
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:25,179
I don't think I i'm still into I

407
00:24:25,179 --> 00:24:28,380
well practice we all have a launch CD

408
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,429
hurry up

409
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:36,760
I we change the code like it was all the
more I'm sorry

410
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,029
the old any other questions

411
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:46,750
about them was it really you who left
those messages on

412
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,159
on sees emotion towards voicemail are
now that

413
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,159
in fact that guy is well I think
employer knapsack

414
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,039
arm I never met him but it wasn't me
that

415
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,908
there was some voicemail messages that
were left on him or the machine

416
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,990
coincidently at the same time that jay-z
and I attacked as computer system

417
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:08,130
and a arm

418
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,760
it was kinda funny because once we got
into his machine

419
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,470
we were interested in looking at the
stock that he was doing with the okie

420
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,559
900 him in a guy named Marc Lotter

421
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,990
and shame a more adult in image are

422
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,380
obvious firmware which included the
stuff in the in memory

423
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,139
they were able to finder the cage that
he had first answering machine

424
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:32,230
enforce office because you're right
there because you see it in his phone's

425
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,720
memory

426
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,250
and so jay-z were on the freeway he's a
paper on a beer ship Israel I mean

427
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,630
I think under Colorado at the time and i
three when she Moore's office machine

428
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,309
and I put in the code to retrieve this
message is that weird sea messages

429
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:49,668
we're thinking worry worrisome how long
was somebody watching us

430
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:54,590
do this and the daily this message is it
was was like coincidently within minutes

431
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,379
so but no I have nothing to do with it
but the guy that actually did it

432
00:25:58,379 --> 00:25:59,139
actually

433
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:03,470
call them and left two messages after I
was arrested in the same voice

434
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,370
you know so I guess his country was the
best I

435
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,750
up want

436
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:15,129
one quick one is it you would 1.28 your
own long distance

437
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:19,240
an Xcode no doubt but I did but I did
however

438
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,360
happen to own in pac bell Southern
California

439
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,649
the it special phone numbers a special
prefix for the phone company they were

440
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:27,230
8-1-1 numbers

441
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,450
so any employee they knew they were down
8 11 prefix be an internal number:

442
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,139
so what ideas I have my own 811 number
so I could be any department within the

443
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:35,720
phone company

444
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,039
okay good you where there was a record
including around years ago

445
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,580
that apparently me without me as well
fate

446
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,760
but apparently it's just the metallic
10x codenamed

447
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,250
instead of saying came up with your with
your name in the usual

448
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,770
Bell Voice and I thank you for using
kevin Mitnick yet that thing

449
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,289
yeah the real lady that the AT&T
recordings that recording for a friend

450
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:56,830
of mine

451
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,460
so basically was it was also was taken
out look at the area's

452
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,549
actually really good was really her boy
turning with Pat yeah

453
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:07,139
mike thanks but think he didn't actually
have a coach said it was just a phase

454
00:27:07,139 --> 00:27:09,080
now it was a pic that I was scary

455
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,490
math yeah customer years

456
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,520
all we did was we figured out how we can
intercept directory assistance for Rhode

457
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,590
Island

458
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:22,340
so whatever a customer recall in I got
to play telephone operator

459
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,330
yes day tone day exactly and after we
work that out

460
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,720
some unsuspecting customers calling on
what city we would say what city in

461
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,149
say Providence okay helping them yes for
listing

462
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:38,789
was he all but we were doing a survey
you guys have no idea why pay 230 pages

463
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:40,360
at home

464
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,860
oh yes we do over by the way were you at
home there oh yes quite on me

465
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,260
go to the point ever yes ma'am the
numbers 555 2 1/2 37

466
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,460
what 555 2 1/2 37

467
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,679
of are dollar have reading at the park

468
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,669
so the fuck up a shot that down in the
day

469
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:10,679
well it was fun

470
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,530
do you think you've had more affect on
the hacker culture as

471
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,530
murder or as a deterrent

472
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,928
or alarm that's a good question murder
or deterrent

473
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:25,530
I think the I don't think I was much of
a deterrent

474
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,360
I'm because if you go to cybercrime dug
up in you look at all these hacking

475
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,399
cases that were after me

476
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,070
I am as a as a as I think a lot of
people for to the case

477
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,610
probably X for careful

478
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,659
that they don't do things the where they
could wind up

479
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:45,530
in the same place that I was you know
and hopefully that will happen today if

480
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,270
somebody

481
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:50,350
does commit some sort of hacking Thai
Prime hopefully they

482
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,919
the the Government Camp ore the war over
the federal Fisheries eyes like they did

483
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,260
in my case

484
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,408
so hopefully I was able to create the
sense of awareness

485
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:01,679
to help everybody out there so they
don't become the next kevin Mitnick in

486
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,889
that regard

487
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:06,960
all this we have used for president well
this we have you for a precedent

488
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,960
yet that I'm impressed

489
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,610
not really like a sure thanks a given it
a question on

490
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:20,940
dealing with all the stuff know
psychologically immensely

491
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,080
now that it's over with and your getting
on with your life what

492
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,080
what plans what what things you looking
for to nowadays

493
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,100
to to make up been rebuild you we

494
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,740
loss well I my short term

495
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,990
my short term goal are I'm working on a
new book

496
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,720
let you wanna mention that everybody
work in this new book called The are

497
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,280
different rusian

498
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,559
which is a a kind of a sequel to the art
of deception and this is going to be

499
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,440
different it's not going to be

500
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,869
about social engineering is going to be
about

501
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:54,280
the innovator a sexy the clever the
interest the most interesting hacks in

502
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,450
cyberspace

503
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,790
were either the target was particularly
interesting

504
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,428
or worthy attacker used maybe

505
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:06,070
a blended attack let's talk about
something that was simply downloading

506
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,439
exploit code

507
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,419
and running against a target them
something that's a took some thinking

508
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:12,149
took some creativity

509
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:15,590
I'm still looking for people like to
come forward and share their stories

510
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,549
with me in fact

511
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:20,309
the deadline is actually in a week as
the last element something is for so

512
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:21,500
many view

513
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,210
like to be with me in private while I'm
here at the conference

514
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,629
you guys have any stories you would like
to share

515
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:32,679
by if it makes it into the book
overpaying two hundred dollars

516
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,059
if farm if it's the best we've all
working 500

517
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:40,049
if you give me a sense of what the best
story so far as we got these group for

518
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,270
guys

519
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,960
that went to Las Vegas they got became
very interested in the video poker

520
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,200
machines

521
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,119
they bought one they took a back to New
York the reverse engineer the firmware

522
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,290
in the machine

523
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,350
and they weren't able to develop another
program

524
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,970
they could find where in the sequence a
pseudo-random number generator was

525
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,350
they were able to get a Royal Flush
David actually be able to get a Royal

526
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,040
Flush

527
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,270
a certain amount of time think it's up
their watches and no in eight minutes

528
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,309
and 36 seconds

529
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:13,480
royal was gonna come up and they took
Vegas for hundreds of thousands dollars

530
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,450
were never caught

531
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,309
but that's a really interesting story so
it's not

532
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:22,309
so that the other two different I
packing that's basically find a flaw in

533
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:23,639
the application

534
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:26,690
i'm looking for social engineering
physical Wireless

535
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,290
our technical that's going to be
innovative in if you

536
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,418
have a problem sharing your Black Caps
stories

537
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:36,480
which i think are the most compelling
well we all

538
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,639
if your pen tester any views the very
innovative and clever

539
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:44,350
an interesting method that you're
willing to discuss I'm also interested

540
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,770
in that too

541
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,080
but as far as your question is what I
want to do like in my future

542
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,889
as I was want to continue to be a
successful author work in their work as

543
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:53,720
a consultant

544
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,440
in this industry arm I kinda put
building my company defensive the key on

545
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,129
hold

546
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:02,710
because I I'm busy going around
traveling a lot

547
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,780
30 talks in social engineering arm

548
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,030
work we develop the two day seminar on
how to train companies to be less

549
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,678
about to be less resistant to social
engineering type attacks

550
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,290
so so that it probably know sharing
other and and giving that awareness

551
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,540
somebody else's

552
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,100
is given you peace of mind a benefit
from

553
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,799
from from we've learned so far ever
basically I'm taking

554
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:29,649
what I know best what I have a passion
for technology

555
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:33,240
and trying to use it in a way that helps
people

556
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,850
and at the same time gives me that
challenge give me that the real

557
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,970
gives me that knowledge that hacking
provided for

558
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,210
because that's what are provided for me
was again it was sheer entertainment

559
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:47,320
an than this pursuit of knowledge
wanting to know how things work

560
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,830
you know in in today unfortunately the
media has term

561
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,220
change the terms a hacker to mean
somebody that's a criminal that uses a

562
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,010
computer to steal credit card numbers

563
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:59,399
for example which is really unfortunate
foresaw

564
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:05,059
thank you thank you

565
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:09,260
it's good to see you can thank you for
coming after following

566
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,649
the story for life and reading a book in
hearings present

567
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:16,460
hearing your speech today it's painfully
obvious that

568
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,340
people in non-technical positions in
corporations

569
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,010
have some access to information that is
technical

570
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,100
and could cause problems for security
may not even realize

571
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,700
the scope whatever it is whatever that
one little piece information

572
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,850
that they possess up about how I really
could be

573
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,869
now do you believe that

574
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:44,649
the solution to up to these practice
kinda

575
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:48,190
to the service issue Asian would be to
hire technical people

576
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,429
even for non-technical positions people
who have a hacking background who

577
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,879
understand these things already

578
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:57,470
even for say an accounting position your
human resources position or secretary

579
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,419
for instance

580
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:02,429
or do you feel simply that social
engineering

581
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:05,710
training after you hire in play or

582
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,159
other chain mystical technical skills is
sufficient

583
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:13,619
to curtail this prop well first of all I
think the most important thing

584
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,730
is dat kinda changer corporate culture
and get people to internalize

585
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,020
that security is important because if
they don't internalize that behavior

586
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,799
it's basically based on external forces
like your boss watching your management

587
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:26,750
watching you

588
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,069
then as soon as management is watching
basically revert back to

589
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,918
what they want to do anyway so first the
first major step is going to

590
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,000
internalize that security is an
important part of their job

591
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,310
and secondly a giving them

592
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,460
the kind of an education and how it
works what are the methodologies the

593
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,339
tactics and strategies

594
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:48,779
that social engineers use the most
common thing that people are or where is

595
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,190
the Nigerian scam

596
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,580
because everyone's been the target over
and once they have come to the general

597
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,600
framework

598
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,730
about social engineering works then you
can put them to

599
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,440
some sort of resistance training it's
kind of like inoculation

600
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,950
in a sense we try to inoculate them up

601
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:08,759
by using certain methods so they're more
aware and more

602
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,589
less likely to circumvent security
protocol because at the end of the day

603
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:15,980
the attacker wants to convince his or
her target

604
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,780
to circumvent security protocol it's
really a challenge for you have

605
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,869
organizations

606
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,910
but don't have a security protocol they
don't have written policy

607
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,330
so if you don't have a policy of no
where to start and so sometimes it

608
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,089
really

609
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:31,759
they have to build this from the ground
up but putting technical position people

610
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,480
people like a technical background doing
mundane work I don't think would really

611
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,660
work they probably bored with the
position

612
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,470
I don't think it's really necessary it
might be like if they're an accountant

613
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:45,330
having the technical skills might help
them with Excel but I I don't think it's

614
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,160
really

615
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,589
you have together those extremes I think
once people

616
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:53,259
or introduced to what social engineering
is 130 Nakia lated

617
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,600
once they understand a a

618
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,830
the methods and tactics that are used
what they could distinguish between

619
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,960
what's a legitimate request in what is a
manipulative request

620
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,859
it it raises the bar but unfortunately
can't

621
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,500
inoculate everybody is always going to
be somebody

622
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,339
that thinks they're their operate under
the illusion of invulnerability

623
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:20,089
and a camping trip so the first another
first step is

624
00:36:20,089 --> 00:36:24,290
demonstrating that everybody's horrible
and you do that by burning them

625
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:27,799
once they're burn you know in a in a
positive way

626
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:30,849
then they're they're more likely to
learn their lesson

627
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:37,849
that make sense to you yes thank you
they're up

628
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:43,089
adjustment can you touch upon the the
the

629
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,759
the part where you were in North
Carolina and they tried to bite cell

630
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,730
phone

631
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,470
okay turn can you discuss the difference
between back then

632
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:54,560
and today cell phone with the the the
chip that has the

633
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,130
the GPS locator I mean he explain how
that works

634
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,339
how like sure the tracking and well

635
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:06,930
how I was tracked I was using a this
open protocol that I was using was names

636
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,830
but just got all that's a

637
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,319
yeah I think this 11 in California but
pretty much it was i analog

638
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:17,599
cell phone systems and

639
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,119
what did happen is what my first things
I would do is when I move into a

640
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,380
different location

641
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,510
are immediately compromise the
telecommunications infrastructure where

642
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,030
I was living side if the complete
control

643
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:32,520
so soon as every move to Raleigh by
compromise kten have full access to all

644
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,630
switches their answers

645
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,430
they were southern belle what ideas I
modified

646
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,149
the the Dems switch to the contract to a
trace

647
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,710
on my calls but basically put it into a
loop

648
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,030
in the know we're so it really fussed
rated the government

649
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,990
because they can get nowhere in tracking
me so apparently she more came up with a

650
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:57,390
a bright idea arm

651
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,420
is based on what we believe

652
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,620
cabin would be calling what internet
service providers

653
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,850
why don't we do a terminating number
search

654
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:11,470
and then we could locate the foul in the
yes and that is pearl use it

655
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,270
that's precisely what they did is I
would call and netcom

656
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,710
they searched all the part numbers in
the local switch in North Carolina

657
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,589
identify the number then they found
what's all cell towers

658
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:27,700
that I was close to went out with the
Sault Ste Co and Denard yeah

659
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,810
and if you know anything about radio you
know anything it was 800 megahertz range

660
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,480
it's pretty simple to the radio
direction finding and that's how I was

661
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,640
identified

662
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,660
in today's world the sailor systems have
evolved in such a way that

663
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,540
easier to track your right arm

664
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,730
and I think AT&T has friends and family
feature from what I remember if you want

665
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,549
to know

666
00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:53,980
where you're not some CI white you from
there were

667
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,560
yet so their friends and families you
can find out the GPS location

668
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,109
have somebody that as authorized it

669
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:04,600
but an interesting thing is I think that
could be abused because remember what I

670
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:04,850
S

671
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,920
tracking the location for the federal
agents I had access to our

672
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:13,100
your touches network Accorsi
legitimately there was a system called

673
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,370
in a mass

674
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,970
so I could basically in real time to an
inquiry

675
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,230
on a cell number if and it would tell me

676
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,720
the last call incoming outgoing call and
actually give me the cell

677
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,950
cell number that was outside look up at
a chart they will see the

678
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,990
other physical location about cell it
within with

679
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,650
in real time so I was able to track
anybody on their network

680
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,900
but don't forget this was a a decade ago
so

681
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,600
I was possible a decade ago you gotta
think what possible that

682
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,390
I think your cell phone is like a a
homing device for your

683
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,310
let me be a better person to talk about
wireless tracking technologies in the

684
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:49,930
walls

685
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,480
I since he's a were familiar with up
tonight

686
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,549
thanks yep

687
00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:02,250
I can I got a question about your
ability launch nuclear weapons

688
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,339
and ash it's not totally ingest you

689
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:09,850
probably seem to packed or compromised
commercial

690
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:15,640
enterprise companies for seeing as how
we now have the ability to

691
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,270
talk by at internet just about any
country on the planet

692
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,240
do you think it's absurd at this point
to be concerned about people give a

693
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,220
hacker

694
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,910
to launch nuclear weapons given the
government's ineptitude with most

695
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,140
endeavors well I don't know about the US
government's controls are

696
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,450
countermeasures

697
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,640
but I would have to assume that all the
anything to do with the

698
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,210
the cycle weapons of mass destruction
are connected

699
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:44,819
to any type of public network like the
public public switched telephone network

700
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:48,310
or anything I think they're totally
autonomous that's my belief but I could

701
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,200
be wrong

702
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,029
I don't know I think pentagon it or I
work at the pentagon four-year

703
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:57,120
and the secret network in the non passed
by network

704
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,190
were bridged frequently here they're not
separate

705
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,060
yes up well I mean there's always that
that oversight but

706
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,640
just off the top of my head you would
think that would be a no brainer

707
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,740
for not her annette any type for

708
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:15,460
system SCADA systems or whatever that
are connected to any Publix

709
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,770
public networks there were attached and
the Beast iPad devices I just think it

710
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,020
would be stupid

711
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,790
but then again people there were lots to
protect

712
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:29,920
thanks Iraq

713
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,759
but just a a comment on the stupid
things with weapons of mass destruction

714
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:35,180
throughout the

715
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,989
the cold war the cuban missile crisis in

716
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:42,349
on that period the said launch code for

717
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:46,959
most american most if not all america's
new 0.00000

718
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:50,038
on and I thanks for that info

719
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:53,890
the probably like the whistle have
heroes

720
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,118
probably the biggest challenge to

721
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:02,160
technical and non-technical hackers is
staying entertained and staying outta

722
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:02,749
trouble

723
00:42:02,749 --> 00:42:06,359
what advice do you have for
up-and-coming Packers

724
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,519
to make an honest living or at least not
to

725
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,799
big-tent and the criminal record and

726
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:15,799
met keep themselves occupied

727
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:20,170
entertained in any trouble well nowadays
which wasn't available back

728
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,940
when I started was now computer systems
are affordable

729
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,959
anybody I mean I couldn't even buy

730
00:42:26,959 --> 00:42:30,519
a terminal a vt100 terminal you remember
those those dumb terminals

731
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:33,910
over a grand at a triple 1200 baud modem

732
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,269
like fifteen hundred dollars I can
afford it today

733
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:40,449
people can set up their own networks
running various

734
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:43,519
different platforms they can set up
their own lab

735
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,299
an try attacks in their lap in there not
affecting anybody else

736
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:51,229
of course the element export exploration
the element to being so where were you

737
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:51,989
shouldn't be

738
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:55,459
is missing from the equation but at
least you're not affecting anybody else

739
00:42:55,459 --> 00:42:56,249
in your not gonna

740
00:42:56,249 --> 00:43:00,719
probably end up in the cam later any
career advice that you would give to

741
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,699
anyone who's

742
00:43:01,699 --> 00:43:05,569
new to hacking and finds himself yeah I
wanted at now learned a lot about

743
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:07,650
programming learn a lot about debugging

744
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,769
analyzing code fun i mean i havent done
any are coding in years

745
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:16,029
and I have to get back into it because
the

746
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:19,949
no it's an important part over no
testing for security failures as the

747
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:21,390
ability to the Parker

748
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:28,390
thanks here there

749
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,979
as we've seen in your case in another
well-known cases

750
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:35,489
hackers there seems to be a problem in
the justice system

751
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:39,630
um from way over your blown out of
proportion

752
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:45,299
treatment in sentences to just maybe
overall if you're into technology

753
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:48,359
I was wondering if you have any thoughts
about their see a solution for the

754
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:48,989
justices

755
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:53,499
only of course well yeah

756
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:57,089
I mean there's been many cases that have
been blown up or proportion mine Kevin

757
00:43:57,089 --> 00:43:57,808
Poulsen

758
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:03,059
arm and like I guess the government I
guess the problem

759
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:06,170
the US Attorney's Office in federal
cases has an agenda

760
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,839
and part of that agenda is

761
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,430
I believe prosecuting computer-related
crimes more vigorously

762
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:20,109
so don't forget the people that are also
the prosecutors have their own agendas

763
00:44:20,109 --> 00:44:23,459
know they want to step up the stepping
you know they want to advance

764
00:44:23,459 --> 00:44:26,859
you know in their career the more people
they can put in

765
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:30,630
the jail in the longer they can put them
there the more they advance their career

766
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,559
and at the same time you have a true
believers

767
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,309
that are doing it for truth justice and
the American Way because they believe

768
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:36,309
it's the right thing to do

769
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:40,499
to truly hard stereotype you know the
prosecutors but what I do have a problem

770
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:41,170
with

771
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,539
things like the Patriot Act things like
life imprisonment for hacking

772
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:48,839
for example I believe there is a
amendment

773
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,788
to open up the statue we can get life
imprisonment without the possibility of

774
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:53,709
parole

775
00:44:53,709 --> 00:44:58,269
if you use a computer to any cause
serious injury or death to another

776
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:03,239
so I asked myself the question well use
another tool like a car a hammer

777
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,809
to get the same penalty in the car and
the answer was no at least in California

778
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,489
hit somebody with your car and killed
them

779
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:12,779
they have courses on 10 shots reckless
or negligent

780
00:45:12,779 --> 00:45:15,940
make it three or four years for
manslaughter how come if you used a

781
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:16,890
computer

782
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,920
negligently or recklessly killed
somebody or causing injury

783
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,579
you get life without the possibility of
parole so I think I think there's a big

784
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:24,400
disparity

785
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,489
between the types of punishment you can
get

786
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:31,319
based on the too long they don't think
that all should matter should the

787
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:32,119
torsion better

788
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,630
let's get a look at the result with the
result up it'll it's all about that

789
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:39,430
hocus-pocus around computers right
people are afraid still

790
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,029
there yes thanks

791
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:50,029
all right thank you hello

792
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:54,529
say okay now my main question actually
focuses on

793
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:57,589
something that what are actually came to
mind while

794
00:45:57,589 --> 00:46:02,680
so listening to Christian I do his
speech on security and as far as most

795
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,710
trade-offs

796
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,170
Rs yeah now mining question

797
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,749
is sense the you I am you've been doing
public speaking at

798
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:17,119
showing a other companies that okay this
is how easy it is to go through

799
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,449
and trick people using social
engineering now

800
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:23,949
what's to say that it

801
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:27,069
that you're actually getting through to
them and set up for

802
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:30,579
okay we'll just pay to have you come by
do a speech

803
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,609
at just make you look like we care

804
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:36,848
and then not actually hold anything
Council

805
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:40,469
or

806
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:44,039
we can do it one speech with the
speeches is basically

807
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:47,309
in entertaining re-opening

808
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:50,640
a experience

809
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,160
to really dislike people who wear the
problem they're really the way to

810
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,999
hopefully train people company
environment to resist social engineering

811
00:46:57,999 --> 00:46:59,339
is to put them through

812
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,979
the security awareness training program
that's a lot more intensive just hearing

813
00:47:02,979 --> 00:47:03,829
someone speak for

814
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:07,769
for for about an hour right and actually
testing them on their knowledge

815
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:11,359
and even and some situations because
every companies different

816
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,670
their security needs is actually
performing

817
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,739
a a an attack on your own people

818
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:21,739
kinda got social engineering pen testing
to see where your weaknesses are

819
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:25,059
there's two sides to the message here
because there's been some

820
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:28,509
recommendations that

821
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:32,289
but I'll there's been some
recommendations by some the old-timers

822
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:35,710
0 mission test your own security through
social engineering because

823
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:40,449
that's a scanner decrease employee
morale its gonna piss a lot of people of

824
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:44,109
it's going to it's going to at the end
of the day

825
00:47:44,109 --> 00:47:47,328
are we do you know affect your corporate
culture

826
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:50,719
but I don't agree with that I i think
that if companies such they definitely

827
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:53,499
should do that the pen testing on the
social engineering side as well that's

828
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:55,029
the technical side

829
00:47:55,029 --> 00:47:59,079
but also but they should make the people
aware that they might be subject to this

830
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,140
type of testing either when their first
hired

831
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:04,749
into the company as part of a new
employee orientation or for existing

832
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:05,469
employees

833
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:08,519
putting them under its head to test our
security you make it a

834
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,529
you make a call the social engineering
attack

835
00:48:11,529 --> 00:48:14,259
and we're doing this to increase our
security so we just want to give you a

836
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:15,839
heads up

837
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,619
that this is the type of testing were
performed enough people like it well

838
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:23,299
it used to work there the kid choose not
to your

839
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:26,910
alright and shit there's a lot more to
the subject is just like

840
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:30,749
yeah I don't take everyone's time yeah
and I had a second part which

841
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:34,440
ok with her second part well the second
part was also by the same vein

842
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,809
even if they were to go through that
tire testing

843
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:40,949
like say average joe shmoe me decides
what

844
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:45,160
bank I know this that there's something
wrong with the procedure or

845
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,469
in the case of just watching out past
the x-ray machine and I decide

846
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:52,039
pointed out to them now as far as

847
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:55,109
like being labeled as a pop potential
and

848
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:58,150
our enemy combatant stay or

849
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,579
at not actually getting in or with there
be any other

850
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:05,640
approaches to solving such problems so
that it gets rectified

851
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,960
but by the same token no one goes to
jail releases their head over

852
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,269
I I never really thought much about that
you're talking like if you're at an

853
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:14,519
airport in you see a security failure

854
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:17,670
that that somebody can get by like the
the

855
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:20,910
well 30 their or even

856
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:24,009
in the company setting where year

857
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:27,299
very much therefore I mean I think
you're welcome to do that you might miss

858
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:28,779
your neck swyto

859
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:31,759
we will make your point two or three
hours later right but also happened

860
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:32,489
about

861
00:49:32,489 --> 00:49:35,589
I'll trust me after riding Amtrak

862
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:40,359
that's not a problem I mean while radii
me remember the kid that though it's not

863
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:41,390
cover

864
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,808
some to the Bach was a stop on Southwest
flight

865
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:50,249
and the I think they are yours is facing
or was convicted on federal charges

866
00:49:50,249 --> 00:49:53,259
I want goes that that part of their
security especially

867
00:49:53,259 --> 00:49:56,679
in an industry that right now it's
really paranoid butter

868
00:49:56,679 --> 00:50:00,309
PCI Security billy wright certainly try
to notify them

869
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:04,420
maybe by email or by later maybe
anonymously

870
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:08,099
may be a good way so that way you're not
put in some no fly list

871
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:11,479
right but also if even if you were to go
through such approach

872
00:50:11,479 --> 00:50:15,239
and they decide not to heed your advice
you can leave

873
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,829
you know you can what's the old saying
leader leading animal that

874
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:21,890
to the water but you can't make it drink
for their

875
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:26,259
ok white a dream lover comes to my

876
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:31,890
I I'll thanks very much all right thank
you

877
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,890
hours a week okay I and my question yeah

878
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:38,989
a possibility view reviving your
reprogrammed it on tape by

879
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:43,579
okay I thought or all I i havent thought
about getting into talk radio again

880
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:48,239
I might do so in the future but Leila
poured out as a care by show

881
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,829
and I recommend you listen to it it's a
a it's a great show

882
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:55,059
an ugly when ya get back into talk radio
I really enjoy doing it

883
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:59,199
a but the I went on to different and
diverse

884
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,559
okay okay ok right well just a quick is

885
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,869
any possible those programs being made
available on the Internet

886
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:09,839
or an archiver media buyers on

887
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,190
I really thought about that but already
by cohost

888
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:16,219
Alex I think has some copies on on

889
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:19,710
DVD I might ask for a pic I posted to
the Internet

890
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,489
but then we got a fighter your
permission because they have commercials

891
