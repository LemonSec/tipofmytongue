1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:03,639
earnings call a lot of our bodies our
body

2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:08,610
this is mainly because we don't have
money to buy the software

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,070
so we are stuck with learning but
fee-only

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:17,260
well lately

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:21,810
a Romania has been know to export a lot
of our program apps

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,150
I'll this so this thing stop

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,060
the recently because our

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,680
a common because to causes one is a

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,710
depend on on file country but Birmingham
program also going to

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,520
plessy I Western Europe or the United
States

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,270
lately this country the develop the

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:52,450
a relatively healthy a attitude towards
above outsourcing

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,200
and they don't get anyone who just have
a diploma or

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,470
a computer science diploma and

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,910
Oso because arm in the last two years

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,230
McGoo Dominion government actually
implemented a a few facilities for the

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:15,230
for programmers on come

18
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,250
a few years ago a to be a problem a

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,610
a you may need to be a good programmer
was

20
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,400
to know how to write a software to but a

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,630
but I do word a juice bar execution time

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:41,729
and the are so de clases bomb memory
space

23
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,860
a allocated for the program lately this
finger has be seen it has been changing

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,830
up as well as a weaver evolution of our

25
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,170
object-oriented the software I'll

26
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:57,960
artillery and get code arm late levers a
new

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,400
are down don't seem for squalls

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,190
to are on

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,610
to go up but I am approach a western
approach

30
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,560
daughter computer science in the bed
means teaching

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,870
a concrete languages

32
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,010
let a C-plus plies Java arm

33
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,390
but a I have to mention a game

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,840
because of our vile bad economy

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,549
you Romania schools don't have money to
pay for the software

36
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,719
so all for teaching but his I'll

37
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,060
all what teaching but his number is down
by ER

38
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,750
buy books up students don't have work
too much access to a computer

39
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,109
I I was a student until five years ago

40
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:47,569
and I remember 13 8990

41
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,469
80 still working got Univerity donors
eate

42
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:57,250
on pure z80 processor that those lonely
processor but by university which is

43
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,260
wanna were talking to me now could
provide for us %uh

44
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,409
was a patient base kind of bad combo
with your the

45
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:11,409
but to our to come

46
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,760
also the government is taking right now
I'll

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,109
new couple of approaches to art via a
cybercrime

48
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,829
a even we for Orvis restoration putting
front

49
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,680
of our buyout program watching Romania
we still managed to be known as

50
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,519
one of the top country provider so far
cybercrime

51
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,829
over so-called cybercrime arm undercover

52
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,470
I'll pressure by over western Europe and
United States

53
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,680
Romanian government finally passed some
lows but

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,450
the protect but protect against Bisping

55
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,269
a this loss are kind of were stupid in
my opinion

56
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,420
couple of you know one of a Romanian guy

57
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,150
24-year-old remain young guy I'll or
modified the

58
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,389
version of a blast at a warm was the

a sentence of 15 years in prison

60
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,209
which is the

61
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,510
dar almost double the amount for the a

62
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:21,510
a rape on venture conviction your domain

in the computer field

66
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,920
a till the end of his life which is a a
really hard for a

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,940
for people um

68
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,170
let me come back to I'll

others it they don't do it from home
because the

95
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,580
not because they are afraid of being
caught

96
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,419
I think they are smarter than that but
because over

97

pretty me to stay by still bottom and
company

112
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,720
got chose because the quality of a
product a

113
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,510
what

114
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,500
can I tell you about to the

115
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,819
over level of farm

116
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,180
not a level above

117
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,270
I'll access to information there

118
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,690
is a a

119
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,569
because even weaver leave such small
access of information we managed to be

120
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:04,569
banned from

121
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:09,409
eBay and other online sites up

122
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:13,759
us to give away but I Shonda tool for
the other Eastern Europe countries

123
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,789
just because over a hacking cracking and
cutting

124
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,300
problem but exists for are and

125
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,669
almost kids I'm not a script kiddies
they actually right but also up for

126
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:27,229
debate

127
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:29,878
up

128
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,539
I'll they do everything by themself and

129
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,069
in mind my purse on opinion is because

130
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,570
over education bout a

131
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,610
they are the the sybian

132
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,480
in schools as I told if we are alone not

133
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,410
on specific operating see obeyed
operating system programming language

134
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,230
obviously do it at home in school we
alone

135
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,850
algorithms for all four years the
in-school

136
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,940
in computer science course we just learn
our gordon's

137
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,550
and his mind makes it much easier to to

138
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,630
are to learn new

139
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,990
a new languages to

140
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,629
makes a I think it makes some

141
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:22,750
I'm open mind more open mind then people

142
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,780
if woodland jus were up

143
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,810
a plane language again I have to
apologize I'm

144
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:37,810
birdie nervous

145
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:45,130
I'm thankful for my papers

146
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,380
well one of the biggest problems in
eastern europe

147
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,560
is so Silva counterfeiting and pilot the
software a

148
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,450
recently a c'mon take the just

149
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,860
pressure but a man and government to
arrest a group of counterfeit or single

150
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,420
mania

151
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,410
I'll cool

152
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,829
most stunning girl copies of about
products

153
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:15,389
I'll but the

154
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,759
again you have to understand the
situation there

155
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:23,499
for average salary your mom he is the a
100 to 110

156
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,079
dollars let's a mom it's not that they
it's not the week its

157
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:31,759
a mom and the but computer software

158
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,860
computer hard work was the same as here

159
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,040
so if Symantec's observe product for

160
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,618
two hundred dollars I'll have to work to
moms

the government is promising a lot of
things

216
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,950

make less than fifty dollar sum of

221
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,770
for but for some in the household

222
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,180
overtime to give them two hundred fifty
dollars well

223
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,209

again was only on paper because

224
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:58,030
if that family was making fifty dollars
per

225
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,770
per person on the household a and a
computer

226
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,760
is costing let's say six under seven
hundred dollars most two hundred fifty

227
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,550
dollars more government was offering

228
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,160
what are helping too much believes
started being

229
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,350
and to put on by Eva my computer

230
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,900
this is only just two alignment Romania

231
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,410
to to world a European Union

232
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,560
lows it so me too much just bureaucracy

233
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,760
I'll

234
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,260
are so Microsoft implemented

235
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,100
last year a solution together with a
government of Romania

236
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,760
I'll which brings us back to work
company stage

237
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,830
I'll its presented the man nice

238
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,410
digital way but what it does a

239
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,250
it's a

240
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,060
almost like a

241
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,770
United States circle on budget a it's
collecting information about

242
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,189
world a citizen of Romania and the

243
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:03,210
other them for people but have access
both few people to have access

244
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,740
pool told technology between tonight by

245
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,160
used by means of a internet coffers up

246
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,990
everyone is a pretty hyped above this
thing because mcgovern put to be

247
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,450
the in front of data gathering

248
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:25,260
so instead of being polled communist way
or data gathering now it's brand new way

249
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,569
of

250
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:32,570
eat data gathering which sounds very
good are

251
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,320
well a novel wavy

252
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,110
that trying to to improve our

253
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,580
a

254
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,420
a

255
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,390
one with a trampoline provide team does
the middleman ace

256
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,640
to change up education system cool

257
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,689
make it more I'll like the

258
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,550
a accident accidental counties

259
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,240
personally disagree with that i think
over education system that eliminates

260
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,980
good ball wheaties I'll those

261
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,060
its a rain over education system you
mean a is a

262
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,550
8 primary classes for high school years

263
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,500
banner five years of college this gives
you are BAE

264
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,630
covenant of a BA degree and I'll

265
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,590
actually as cousin this gives you are
I'll

266
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,899
be a and master deeply cue violent

267
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,440
and asked about youth you choose you can
go for one year of

268
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,630
for doctor to

269
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,310
to continue her studies I'll and they
are trying grain out to

270
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:47,310
make it put it as well duration of world
education simple from five to forty

271
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,530
years

272
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:53,190
daytime thing producer credit systems
paid grady systems

273
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,740
are until now for education you know me
know was free

274
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,670
I'll everyone based on their merits of
course

275
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,680
by admission tool on colleges

276
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,790
pretty harsh but the based on your
grades you don't have to pay

277
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,850
for education you

278
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,510
can go from master to leave all playing
a single dime

279
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,150
it so is pretty good I'll

280
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:26,260
one bad thing about the education system
you to me is but relations between

281
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,160
students and teachers

282
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,300
up i likey a

283
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,590
students I actually for to be done to
ask

284
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,709
a to have a dialogue with world we but
teacher

285
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,780
youthful

286
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,520
it happened to me actually assigned to
ask a question and I got kicked off

287
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,280
my class because I was interrupting
speech

288
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,460
very much waihee Worthing goes

289
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,500
goal there over teacher comes

290
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,410
into class takes a

291
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,240
a piece of choc star sighting on
Blackboard

292
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,930
from reads from some papers and

293
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,700
after two hours he leaves your why left
lever

294
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,159
no question you have to study by
yourself you have any questions

295
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:16,169
a as I said you can't ass

296
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:20,289
we can't ask him I'll that's one thing
but

297
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:27,289
but will have to to change

298
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,399
on till 1993

299
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,990
1994 a Romanian presence on the internet
was a

300
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,340
was insignificant a after 1994

301
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,620
I unexplained company

302
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,310

above

303
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,740
for artist or intimate was still the
same those a ball Mina

304
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,900
im aim for proliferation although
web-sites on on by Internet I'll

305
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,100
they are pretty much basic web sites but
the

306
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,930
from our 95 to 98

307
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,690
up

308
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,039
I know a couple of Romanian companies
will develop well

309
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,400
hi a high-level e-commerce web sites

310

312
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:35,410
someone specific aim for if you give me
a second

313
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:44,169
I'll yet from this

314
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,000
this period of for a ball more flowing
remain an Internet

315
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,740
lasted from a as I from 95 to like

316
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,779
1999 to follow some are from

317
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:01,240
2002-2004 are because over depreciation
of love

318
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,529
%uh of Armenian currency a

319

harder

320
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,309

321
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:15,928
the showbiz a decline involve in the
number of

a

358
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,200

a buddy elation between the professors
and students and remaining out what

415
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,790
would you do if you have a question on
the planet and

416
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,560
trying to clarify well as some battles a

417
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,690
dished leon a process or just simply

418
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,310
if you're still refuse to explain I'll

419
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,570
what you do you cannot going complaint
to

420
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:14,629
anyone as the first thing because beds
for best but I'd Asian

421
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,450
its the thats

422
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,610
busboy things up there now if if I go
and tell them

423
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,160
years but in Western Europe they they
have a total to have an open dialogue in

424
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,280
but that is not

425
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,889
adjusted for blackboard and write
something

426
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,220
people ask you you asset-backed are

427
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,540
was not the case they have gun will tell
you are crazy and

428
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,470
you can actually getting I will get
expelled if your title push it too hard

429
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,740
well or the ID done

430
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,530
all my colleagues Deedle we had to go to
the library

431
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,540
and

432
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,170
find someone actually smart enough to
explain us

433
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,360
number proper so it's our same

434
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,420
in proportion of ninety-five percent of
what teacher

435
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,420
they all if you stole

436
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:12,340
to I'll to explain something to you

437
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,120
and they actually posted on

438
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,630
on

439
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:25,630
enough for a personal affront to feel if
you stop Butler simple to ask a question

440
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,609
no birds

441
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:52,228
averts a that's changing just on for
paper but so

442
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:55,820
up love project posed by four government

443
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,729
a again ministering to get into European
Union and they have to all and to all

444
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:02,369
vote but a good relations

445
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,509
so about trying to push this loan now

446
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:09,419
to align by education system ple cool

447
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,599
accidental standards I'll I

448
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,639
dope personally but service think will
actually be implemented

449
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:21,159
because one thing we r missing

450
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:22,640
world

451
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,030
for young teachers are a teacher to make
single many others vanna

452
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,460
driver bus driver

453
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,130
so teachers doctors I actually wanna
below spate classes a

454
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,890
Class A I'll say jobs in

455
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,610
in Romania solve am NOT so many young
people who

456
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,620
whole go into world a to become teachers

457
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,760
I'll mostly or what they just sold

458
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,030
they even if

459
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,100
our style thing but the

460
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,620
learning the specific languages better
than

461
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,470
learning general algorithms is good a

462
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:08,200
is better are both teacher will pull

463
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,440
all don't know how to implement that but
thing

464
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,440
so we are stuck with West ok with this

465
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,300
I'll I know little bit about 20 Bulgaria
have a couple of Bulgarian friends

466
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,790
and the I'm till

467
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,220
96-97 Romania was a

468
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,320
one of our are top

469
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,809
for money Eastern European countries

the virtually he

473
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,850
invested employees infrastructure

474
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:16,940
they a they broke or more Nepal's

475
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,590
like in a manner everything gets com

476
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,570
