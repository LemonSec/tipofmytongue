1
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:37,610
hello okay we settle down at a low

2
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,060
up okay

3
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,520
welcome to social engineering which John

4
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,810
thank you which show how we
traditionally do on Sunday

5
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,680
because lower corporate people like to
come just for that I'm wanting to pay

6
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,300
for price

7
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,940
are chasing people come here at at 3:55
from AT&T and they pay 50 bucks for the

8
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,390
weekend just to see this one panel

9
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,940
well i disappoint them so where are we
going to where we're gonna of course be

10
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,859
talking about the

11
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,890
what social engineering is I'll with our
esteemed panel here we're also going to

12
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,940
attempt to make some calls like we

13
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,540
by today sometimes keep in mind though
this is I'm

14
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,829
pretty well on planned we have a couple
things lined up that that may work may

15
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,100
not work but I understand with

16
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,110
any attempt at social engineering it
could fail completely

17
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,130
so it's it's very nerve-racking we want
to do something cool wanna be successful

18
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,329
and get information when it was to be
able to get but it could fail we could

19
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,830
get nothing we could get yelled at we
could have the cops called on as we

20
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,319
don't know

21
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,730
are let's start by a.m. by a it is
everybody on the panel

22
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,099
over to my right is Cheshire catalyst

23
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:49,099
and to my meteorite

24
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:58,310
kevin Mitnick the you know me and to my
left is Barry s

25
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:07,050
the evening

26
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,540
I was started by asking kevin says he's
the

27
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,298
the master social engineer according to
all the authorities

28
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,370
what is social engineering well it's a

29
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,548
basically using deception manipulation

30
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:22,840
in influence techniques to get people to
say yes

31
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,290
to what you want them to do a for
example

32
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,729
giving you a piece of information or
doing some sort of action that creates a

33
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,789
security hole that you can exploit later

34
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,330
I guess that's a reasonable definition

35
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,500
whenever there's humans involved this
seems like our

36
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,900
there's going to be a weakness someplace
as long as human beings are involved

37
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,490
you'll be able to get information that
you not supposed to get from them and

38
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,760
that's really what social gatherings all
about what to do with the

39
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,349
beyond that point that's really up to
you you know you might just be trying to

40
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,080
get to

41
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,349
I get some information that will be an
advantage he somehow

42
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,389
are you might be trying to do something
more nefarious

43
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,419
you know I still cheap whatever are
we're here just to demonstrate in talk

44
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:04,979
about

45
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,760
how easy it is to get people to tell you
things they really shouldn't be telling

46
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,200
you

47
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,620
maybe we can just a couple of examples
from the past as to

48
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,910
what we're talking about things that
have happened Yesenia

49
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,950
me spiritually I never did it before
Trevor

50
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,750
well somewhat social engineering years
is going to be places where maybe you're

51
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,030
not supposed to be

52
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,710
I used to have far a series of things I
called Operation backdoor Road

53
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,530
find my way into the backstage area
other is con- certain things

54
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,260
whose mothers brothers were coming to
town way back in the sixties

55
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,740
and other red here's mine as was their
political pundit pat paulsen

56
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,620
who actually voted for President number
times arm

57
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,630
so I'm mob underground in the War
Memorial Auditorium Rochester New York

58
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,620
with my good friend

59
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,220
and we're waiting for people to come
around because disposal be there

60
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,870
very early the locals letter from outta
town the other counters that your local

61
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,010
number knows who you are

62
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,530
and running around with a clipboard so
you must be official right

63
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,650
so we're coming around this corner and
we see down the long corridor just

64
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,000
underneath the stage

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,180
this fellow coming towards us a behind
him Lagarde

66
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,640
following him so the smaller comes up to
us

67
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,810
and I say to him hi I guess you're not
supposed to be here

68
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,510
either he takes this into Olarte yeah I
guess so

69
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,349
okay come with me every step into the
dressing room right there

70
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,770
are I'm don't sit down you

71
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,969
the he was walking up you start filling
with your camera L

72
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:42,310
and I would double booking the back to
my clipboard start reading this

73
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,030
and I start scribbling on my clipboard
the guard guess in the dressing room

74
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,110
books in I say hi may I help you well

75
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,210
although it's okay and of egos ever

76
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,150
funny other story about the clipboard is
a there was an inmate that was

77
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,700
incarcerated at leavenworth

78
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,289
the USP United States Penitentiary in he
got some street clothes while he was in

79
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:03,969
custody

80
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:08,669
grab the clipboard then walked around
other facility in the cards were leading

81
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:09,460
him through

82
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,800
anything because he was looking fish
like it was current carry a clipboard

83
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,870
he walked out right to a taxicab at the
outside the president Ranson

84
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:23,870
just a big cabin but only escaped the
true story and

85
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,590
in an ironic twist to this panel itself
would not be possible

86
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,469
on to to have today without social
engineering

87
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:38,029
there's a crucial piece of equipment we
have here a telephone patch which allows

88
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,349
to tie the phone line audio into the PA
system

89
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,570
special a hybrid patch and I had about a
boxing equipment at Uhaul appear

90
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,610
Philadelphia and

91
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,900
are so tired I forgot to pack that box

92
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,010
so I got up near a couple days ago and
now this realize yesterday

93
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,820
I didn't have the box for the phone
passionate and

94
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,330
long guided Philadelphia backers are
exhausted so I called a friend a

95
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,180
Philadelphia

96
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,880
heading over my apartment get it and are
called Amtrak

97
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,700
and they assured me that they could use
a service call pageant package express

98
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,080
to put on a train from 30th Street
Philly up to

99
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,919
our Penn Station over here so on

100
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,109
how do you some social engineering to
get the equipment on the train because

101
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,639
her

102
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,770
they said it can only be certain items
what is it your shipping

103
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,279
I said it's a a piece of electronic
equipment ok we don't we don't allow

104
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,669
electronic went to be shipped

105
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,000
why not say well we don't know what is
it could be a bomb or something

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,110
like okay what is acceptable and they
said clothing and food that sort of

107
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,330
thing so

108
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,180
I call back again and said dad I need to
ship the Peace River clothing

109
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,779
with some books to New York and

110
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:47,680
they said okay and I get my information
and they told me be on a train

111
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,140
that night and be here this morning it
at 10 a.m.

112
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,300
sell-out became a

113
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,200
became a trainee got up here I went over
to the to the station to get it after

114
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,380
ten o'clock

115
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,270
and the office was closed the door is
closed and I talk a security guard is

116

so I was told that Monday morning at the
sunny morning to pick it up

118
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,480

119
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,839
a look at the counter reset actually
pick it up with a security guard was in

120
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,310
I guess I went back to hotel I just took

121
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,920
nice publisher for the National Security
Agency I put that on

122
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,439
I came over with my air came back to
thirty street with a ser

123
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,740
to a radio are using for communications
here the conference

124
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,589
and a walked up to the counter directly
I said we have an urgent package from

125
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:35,200
philadelphia is urging to get it
immediately house just spoke with a

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,820
stern tone of voice with a shirt with
emblem

127
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,470
and the radio and iraq has like yes sir

129
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,990
the

130
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,480
and its one of the biggest challenge in
social engineering is not to live you

131
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,150
can help it

132
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,590
so I didn't tell any like a said this is
an urgent security issue

133
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,240
I'm I didn't say I was the National 30
agency you let me right back there he

134
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,600
said

135
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,470
whatever you need surrogate Nick at
whatever you need and i'm looking right

136
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,200
at least there's all these packages

137
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,680
I said dad alright this is the 1i need

138
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,840
shirts it's yours

139
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,860
as I just look at the bike or walk out
with anything from packet from Amtrak

140
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,960
I package express so if you need
anything there

141
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,610
where the guarding unbelievable

142
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,270
you didn't hear that here

143
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,980
their block away bernie if a Bernie
remember all of the exits

144
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,660
hepburn you remember summer thing where
a a another's about a decade ago and I

145
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,300
went into a courthouse to get

146
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,020
somebody's file I went up to the core
clarken is dressed in a suit was wearing

147
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,210
my to me to reach D

148
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,780
radio and she handed me the file but
also another

149
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,550
document that said sealed record with it
and she thought it was some sort of a

150
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,540
law enforcement or court officer

151
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,400
so I got a copy the sealed record
without even asking she perceive me to

152
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,840
be

153
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,450
an authority based on the suit and the

latest we can do this

310
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,690
is six our time which is nine your time
so we're going to ask you to do is just

311
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,670
for five minutes

312
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,850
it's actually closer to two minutes but
just to be safe for five minutes

313
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,140
you could just not used to register say
from nine o'clock 905

314
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,220
905 maybe just do that for us that I
don't care of the problem

315
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,420
just don't touch register for five
minutes okay at that time and I look

316
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,020
like a sec

317
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,460
our time will stop taking orders until
nine to five exactly and I i

318
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,370
905 probably at 904 but just to be safe
to say 905

319
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:10,930
okay now the cash or dog look after one
that gave you that the lower

320
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,230
the actual race is that we use all of
the RF 3000

321
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,490
yet the fairest readout okay that's
going to getting the upgrade as well

322
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,690
we're gonna do is we're gonna send that
that firmware upgrade them line it

323
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,190
should affect

324
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,280
all your cash registers for that there
will be in sync and said there won't be

325
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,620
any

326
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:28,730
any communication issues between at
that's what the problem is that you can

327
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,240
having

328
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,490
all so we should just five minutes you
can check that damn

329
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,610
for shut down for five minutes are you
can still take orders were just don't

330
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,510
bring them up

331
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,500
alright if you just have you can take
the orders but and make the food and all

332
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,570
that but just on actually touch to
register for frightening crime in

333
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,800
yeah we could you can manage that no
problem okay and just so we're seeing

334
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,380
I what time do you have now on right now
is 429

335
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,120
4109 okay that we have we've got

336
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,260
129 here okay so I'm we appreciate your
help by junior was it yes you

337
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:07,260
okay thank you for a reference alright
governor

338
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,140
arm

339
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,789
if anyone is interested they can go to

340
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,990
18 East 14th Street and Fifth Avenue
around nine o'clock

341
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,220
please somebody go the video camera and
and

342
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:34,220
place a big order to see what they do
and I'm very curious who who's got a

343
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:41,780
story while I recover from that we cook

344
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,970
we could ever ask them to work just
don't worry about

345
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,780
customers during a time period are
corporate authorize you to give

346
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,000
give the food away just for that by
admin its period time but a boy

347
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,220
but but if we did that would have been
committing some kinda

348
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,400
well this app is also you want you want
to maintain that level of trust

349
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,860
you notice he was not suspicious at all
for I was thanks very bizarre things

350
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,650
trying out different

351
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,610
I don't know anything going in there are
then given the store number I don't know

352
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,570
what brand registry had

353
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,020
I didn't know anything about the how
they were set up these things are

354
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,840
connected by phone line I'm pretty sure
but

355
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
I was able to convince him that they
were somehow so he's going to instruct

356
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
his staff not to touch the

357
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,400
things for five-minute period i mean you
know this is a relatively harmless prank

358
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,840
but you can get people to all kinds of
thinking if you were to close the store

359
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,939
for a period of time

360
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,169
send people home you know it's you know
it be I should have the any of this

361
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:30,909
information

362
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,179
many won't be interesting if you find a
restaurant that has a

363
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:38,830
if you don't if you don't get a receipt
your meals for free you call them up

364
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,010
in you some sort uproot axed so they
won't give anybody a receipt for a

365
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,408
certain period of time so then you know
when you're going to get a free meal

366
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,220
right I

367
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,789
the other at work you know malicious
ways of doing things and I malicious

368
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:51,658
ways of doing things

369
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:57,130
when I I what I like to do it I like to
you know establish a relationship with

370
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,190
the person I asked him what his name was

371
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,590
we became friends during your on Scott
you know thanks very much for your help

372
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:05,760
you know and also the hint of trouble if
he doesn't do what I say

373
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,120
are there could be trouble Monday
morning so please

374
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,679
cooperate or else but you know said in a
nice way so that

375
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,610
you know he he believes that he's doing
the right thing and you know

376
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,909
okay to Milan can be it but there's no
real harm done also you should always

377
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:22,030
have a plan for backing out at these
things to

378
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,289
if he calls your bluff have a phone
number ready to give him that sounds

379
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,059
legitimate

380
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,330
have a wave a explaining why you're
saying something that makes no sense at

381
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:29,809
all

382
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:33,649
things like that most the time though
you don't get question as long as you

383
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:35,850
maintain that down that air of authority

384
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,620
they can be tough to out to gain the
confidence but once you are

385
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,640
much practice three times I think it
works I

386
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,010
how many people read Kevin's book by the
art deception I can't recommend a better

387
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,530
book on how social engineering work
stand then

388
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,760
this book here it's written for
companies mostly so that they can now

389
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,110
they can protect themselves but also
there are some ingenious plots in their

390
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,390
are plots and schemes do I get
information including I think when we

391
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,110
were actually

392
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,980
which acquitted others as malicious
anomalous rather I

393
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,870
me you know I don't think that's bullish
there I think your you're telling people

394
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,539
how to

395
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:13,809
exercise the system it's what you do
with the information afterwards right

396
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:14,320
arm

397
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,408
basically I think there was one instance
where you able to actually figure out

398
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:18,960
how

399
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,299
a banquet transfer money to somebody
without any kind authorization

400
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:24,570
whatsoever how something like that work
I think you talk about

401
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,490
Chuck systems which show I i won't. a
favor when there was pretty funny

402
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,399
still has me laughing today is a many
years ago

403
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,549
I was in deedrick women corporations
Easynet

404
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,629
there was a worldwide network like son
says Swan

405
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:43,640
DAX was easier and they had a they had
techno protocol

406
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,080
and I was looking for a program a
commute a piece of commercial software

407
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,070
sensors

408
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,970
nothing freer sure where rocket pretty
much but a sniffer on one other

409
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:55,390
one of the nodes in the network so I can
capture occur

410
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,399
tax traffic you know I'll be a like
passwords and stuff like that so I could

411
00:27:59,399 --> 00:27:59,870
spread

412
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,360
know throughout the network easier so I
did some research

413
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,590
I found that a company called up their
computer systems

414
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:11,120
had an office in Los Angeles and I
actually was living in LA at the time

415
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,500
this is when I was a teenager

416
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,669
side did a little bit a research based
on my your

417
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:20,450
phone freaking knowledge and I found out
that this company was actually run at

418
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,500
this guys house

419
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,270
into local a California so I did a
little research I found out all the

420
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,679
phone numbers that were terminating at
that residence

421
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,950
in other words have any foul lines they
had only have like three one was a

422
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,149
regular line for voice interest to you

423
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:37,620
that had dial-up a lot modems attached

424
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,360
so I went to BT wen maybe 200 terminal
dialed up to these modems

425
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,080
and I notice the behavior up the system
on the other end was a VMS system

426
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,949
that was asking there would be a would
be better which meant it was a

427
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,840
looking for system password before would
give you a login prompt

428
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,940
so I thought about the problem for a
while as thinking well maybe worlders

429
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,530
allied call forwarding to those two
phone numbers

430
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,790
42 a system that's under my control

431
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:08,210
and then went on to dial in they won't
be logging into the real system it would

432
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,730
be the decoy system

433
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:14,299
not be able to capture the person's
username and password

434
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,649
but I figured this is such a small
company is run at this guys house was

435
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:19,809
probably two or three employees

436
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:23,960
i cant call the guy at home and say hey
I'm another employee because he

437
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,090
you know that obviously won't work so I
thought about

438
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,299
another better doing up instead of

439
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:33,960
called morning the dial in number
because it was unlikely their customers

440
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,049
would dial in

441
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:38,010
would be a lot more likely that he would
dial in from when he was outside the

442
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,309
office

443
00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:44,470
so around that same time DAC was
releasing security patches

444
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,860
because there are so many holes found in
the BM us operating system

445
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,669
that you can be set up an eight hundred
number that anybody can call

446
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:54,690
and they wouldn't you just give them
your name and address and they would

447
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,220
send you a box

448
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,770
with me to pick the media was me turn
I'm you know mag taper

449
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,190
a cartridge tape and you'd have the
latest security patches rolled up onto

450
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,639
the tape

451
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,510
so I found out you can call the number
they didn't verify your customer you can

452
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,760
to say hey my name's Joe Blow by Idrissa
such-and-such 2010

453
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,059
10 kept 10 patch kit in in the wood ship
about federal express the next day

454
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:23,629
so i order 10 so I talked about the box
under the table I put it into

455
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,830
a VMS system that I have access to

456
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,990
and I will back the patch in other words
VMs had a special format

457
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,409
I love how they would store these
patches in what they called back up

458
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:36,360
saves outside

459
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,590
unraveling bike unzip it was like winds
up for example

460
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:45,450
and when I decided to do as I put in a
special mitnick Pacha my own

461
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,789
and what their patch was was to the
program that act

462
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:51,990
acted as the system's beekeeper called
logging out

463
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,289
so I can say it's like been logging in
UNIX or Linux

464
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:59,658
night special patch that are I could log
in with a special password

465
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:04,340
tonight is actually be invisible say I
included dispatcher role the back up

466
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,320
onto

467
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,220
the system and then I wrote back to the
cartridge tape because I could write to

468
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,789
it

469
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:14,740
then I went in I put the state back into
its plastic shipping bag

470
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,059
with the shipping label has actually had
a printed copy what what was being

471
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:18,770
shipped

472
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,520
I went over to a friend's office and
have that shrink-wrapped package to back

473
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,860
in the box

474
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,720
I was thinking okay nasa now all I have
to do is drop this package in the mail

475
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,909
and then when they get a bill install my
special patch

476
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:36,000
so I think about this as an ally and DAC

477
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,399
all their stuff came out over either
Colorado or massachusetts

478
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,990
now I wasn't about to fly to Colorado
Massachusetts or mail it to somebody

479
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,059
else to mail for me

480
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,668
so my next step was still a custom shop

481
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:52,130
so to occur in this is Hollywood right
this is los angeles oh there's a lot

482
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,740
over costume shops for the

483
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,559
no motion picture industry and I got a
UPS uniform

484
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,559
right to get a UPS uniform at the UPS
hat

485
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,610
and I get the clipboard that Cheshire is
so are

486
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,840
this one of his favorites and around
7:30 in the morning

487
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,230
we show up but the purser Companies
House

488
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,289
knock on the door the guy stumbles you
know to the door cuz I think it

489
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:21,760
kinda will come up in-house can help
your UPS we got the server party package

490
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,070
for you know can you please sign in as
russian guy

491
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,928
was actually trying to step inside the
house or the apartment

492
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:31,370
inside the doorway so the guy went look
outside

493
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,580
does anyone know why didn't want the guy
to look outside

494
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,199
no trust exactly pit stop so the guy
never looked outside

495
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,260
I had a way to learn all about two weeks
before the guy install the

496
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,629
security update and it worked but the
was kind of interesting because I was

497
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:47,929
always concerned about

498
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:52,909
what how do you solve the problem of not
having the truck but it worked

499
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:59,290
for wanna

500
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,178
so beware the UPS man or FedEx man
bearing gifts

501
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,240
maybe a Trojan

502
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,399
another effective to learn social
engineering is

503
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:12,730
well the car a couple effective tools
one is stupidity

504
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,340
acting stupid your cell people give you
more information away another's anger

505
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,510
when you're angry people tend to wanna
play k Q&A

506
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:22,940
give you information to calm me down a
little them

507
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,629
so I'm gonna get angry now and

508
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,409
I'm going to make a phone call to to a
video store

509
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:36,950
and see the to see if they'll give me
information nation Guinea

510
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:43,220
who else is only one

511
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,300
I

512
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,119
good

513
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:57,119
up

514
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:03,100
of

515
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,159
good officer Terry for Sri

516
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:10,679
yeah this is really going to be too much
here I i got a phone call from

517
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,960
Blockbuster saying I owe money for video

518
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,490
okay can you hold on one sec have three
people I know by myself right now

519
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:23,490
right with regard to visitors at

520
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:27,899
alright well I maybe maybe I moved to
the top a list I don't know

521
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:32,049
I'll give him a minute to the or the
other and the people and I'm

522
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:35,168
maybe hola how come to us faster

523
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:39,980
I listen to listen here and talk

524
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:46,980
we could take questions

525
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,790
used to make fun there I when we give
the signal to stop talking

526
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,060
because he's back guys have a quick
question do you feel nervous at all when

527
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,940
you doing this are you so used to it
that is just

528
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,020
this there's a degree of nervousness
because you never know what you gonna

529
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,490
walk into but the thing that to remember
is these people can see you

530
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:08,000
they they don't know who you are I I'm
against lying to people that I know and

531
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,890
trust but I have no problem like people
who are never see in my life

532
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,000
it doesn't dislike you know they're
their machines themselves someplace you

533
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,430
know it

534
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,060
they don't care about you you don't care
about them as long as you're not hurting

535
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,810
them

536
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,930
you know you're getting them to give
information out okay but you know you're

537
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,509
using it against them you not

538
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,400
reporting them getting a lot of trouble
hopefully arm you actually prepare for

539
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,640
the conversation

540
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,029
in other words you think about all the
all the objections that the target may

541
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,880
have

542
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,049
and they already think about it ahead a
time before doing the attack

543
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:41,540
see your your you're prepared if you go
in unprepared immediate extemporaneous

544
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,880
it's now it's a less likely or you will
succeed unless the

545
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,760
people on the other end are truly
gullible your and now you know if

546
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,859
if we hold out this guy about time he
gets to us we can be even more angry so

547
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,350
he's gonna wanna were

548
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,500
is gonna wanna really a bend over
backwards to help us so

549
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,730
I'm gonna hold on for a couple minutes
longer and then mobbed him about it

550
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,109

soon as we

553
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,170
we get through this different question
have been having a lot of these

554
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,600

show that this was in fact my back my so

691
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,260
caller ID is one way that that you can
really

692
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,660
I get a good social engineering i prank
going because if someone sees

693
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,870
a number on a screen they're going to
believe that you're actually calling

694
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,109
from that particular place our office or
what not

695
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:08,770
are so it's a great way to gain
credibility and so many people would

696
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:10,580
prove this two years ago so many people

697
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,950
still believe caller ID is dependable
data it's not

698
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:20,090
it could be sparked anything can be
sparked but what number

699
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:25,300
it's a secret that's what that number is
but it just it's a demonstration that

700
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,130
these things do exist and is possible
and its easy

701
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:35,130
I'm gonna swallow this now so nobody
will get it from on

702
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:41,810
me any other the Santa Claus on our
panel had

703
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:47,509
21 you know how it works Alka alright I
can explain how it works

704
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,810
okay they remember uva telephony
community group and

705
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:55,750
they have the the up thus be up
switching equipment there

706
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:59,080
in their facility and they allow you to
are

707
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,480
right XML code like boys XML their call
XML

708
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,500
and it's only like a 10 or 15 line
scripts that we've written

709
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,780
that basically tells us it's really
simple and in the script

710
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,150
just takes the DTM out that I input
through the keypad

711
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,730
and just put it into a field called the
car referral number and then

712
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,270
what it actually does is the number I'm
calling to

713
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,660
does a three-way essentially have three
ways over

714
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,670
sans the car referral number actually
sits under two

715
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,380
the phone company that's the number
we're actually calling from phone

716
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,400
company doesn't Val

717
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,810
validated and then it in then it to
conferences bien

718
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:41,240
once the call is sent so it's actually
like doing a three way call

719
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,420
essentially like a conference call
that's how it's like working technically

720
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,110
under the hood

721
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:49,140
any more questions about I'll be happy
to answer except for not giving the

722
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:49,799
number

723
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:55,310
but the number will be available on his
website

724
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,509
there you go okay I guess

725
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,420
the we have time for one more when we're
try here at something

726
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,660
on as we're talking about before I
various credit card companies

727
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,549
have have employ people and foreign
countries

728
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:13,570
to do the work that people here do for
much more money

729
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:17,330
arm it's it's really kinda frustrating
to sometimes when

730
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:21,470
you're trying to get information and
others either a language problem

731
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:26,700
or there's an justice incredible time
difference where it's nighttime their

732
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,700
daytime here

733
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,740
on it's nice to know where you calling

734
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,480
and not attack you don't realize that
they're calling different places also

735
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,720
we're when you think about it

736
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,780
that you talk to somebody sounds like a
next door when they're on the other side

737
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,490
the world

738
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,060
and I'm and you know who's paying for
their call

739
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,799
sometimes yes sometimes earn present
sometimes there are who knows where they

740
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,000
are you don't know anything about

741
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,190
the call centres so we're gonna try and
find out a little bit about

742
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:54,760
this particular call center and I I have
to stress that we are calling

743
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,950
MasterCard so sometimes they put you on
hold sometimes a

744
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,570
they the act stupid of muster the time

745
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,870
so gonna call 800 number try to get
through an operator's see if we can get

746
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,299
information I think the goal is to find
out where they are

747
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,940
and if possible find out the address
even phone number

748
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,480
something like that my see where it goes
the mood

749
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,270
of up

750
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:26,420
first challenge is getting an operator
you have to have a number that is not

751
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,090
available

752
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:30,270
from your calling happening this on us
again to me

753
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:35,920
take a leap ride

754
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,190
tries on

755
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:48,190
up

756
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:58,450
okay I'm gonna look into this little
further when they travel right

757
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:16,230
we had a problem a either last convert
we had someone

758
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,460
figured out her phone number was here
and they call the phone company and

759
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,580
rise and Adam Cancelar certain services
like long distance and

760
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,180
800 service so that may have happened
but there's a way around that we have a

761
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,950
we have a calling card that allows you
to call

762
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:35,070
800 numbers which is most of them don't
whenever you call an 800 number

763
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,250
they know the number you're calling from
call american express

764
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:41,890
800 number even if your caller ID is
blocked as you think the Senate using

765
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:43,220
another service call Dan

766
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,250
in and I they could have a number
calling from unless you're using

767
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:51,000
special card like this is called the the
red card you can find some other rental

768
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,500
the places you can buy calling card as a
great it's really a call for cheap

769
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,350
overseas

770
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:58,910
from pay phones not going to things I'll
get on a trailer for something to try

771
00:49:58,910 --> 00:49:59,680

774
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,880

775
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,030

punishment so I guess what

776
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:15,350
month away anyway if you're interested
the setup

777
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:19,250
a way that when anyone calls you no
matter if they block the number you can

778
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,670
see whatever they're calling from if
anyone's interested

happening here what does the flips the

832
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,720
caller ID privacy bit because what
happens

833
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,020
is usurp the target number

834
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:09,420
but they're gonna call into reports to
the you reach number which you set up

835
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,300
the you reach number forts to another
number which now will display

836
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,280
the caller ID on blocked understand

837
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,960
aka for example know works

838
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,270
I since century not says we're running
out of time here

839
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,830
and as kevin has to be on an airplane
are rather be on hold with Chase I'm

840
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,170
gonna try the american express you say
it always goes to India

841
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:36,950
usually okay we're gonna try that
instead while he's in a tony is boring

842
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,850
I'm sorry I want to pick somebody
overseas

843
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,950
my comp my comp

844
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:45,500
alright well he's dialing a just a
question for you Cheshire

845
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,940
while you're doing be the disguising
with the clipboard going backstage

846
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,210
concerts have you actually ever gone on
stage

847
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:55,070
know the app it's it's not that hard

848
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:58,320
ever tried using a custom I have not

849
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:04,400
up now another some fun if they block
american express we have to do the other

850
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:11,400
thing

851
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,150
hopefully you reach dot com won't tell
take away that feature anywhere cuz it's

852
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:19,790
kinda cool

853
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:23,130
feeling for the other problem is then
you have two numbers you have to deal

854
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:23,570
with

855
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,110
when the you're gonna receive the
unblock call on and one that the target

856
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:34,110
was gonna call in on

857
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:40,230

it as well tell us about Vonage

00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:32,490
Mumbai I ask every government now I have
a feeling what this is

911
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:36,160
offset by one because the alphabetically
their

912
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,879
one right after the other I so we
probably have database

913
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,400
corruption resulted causes problems
happen

914
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,630
I that's a Casey's fix desperate need
happy

915
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:53,630
direct number so that we can we can
compare in Alaska

916
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:58,140
and far if you're trying to get in touch

917
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:03,009
and with our customer service department

918
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:06,740
and this is that the one hundred 67 and

919
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,790
45 if we have

920
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:13,820
feet numbers available but it also is a

921
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,470
Associated do Manila daily re

922
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:21,980
we need the the number with the country
code entry code oh no

923
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,280
we don't have that it for me arm if you
have a

924
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,150
a local number that you can call for
supervisor word when you need to

925
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:33,070
to reach call center locally if you want
an activist

926
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:36,400
right feed for he might be able to get
some information

927
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,790
may have your name again are you Scott
Williams with MCI

928
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:43,480
and you're just doing troubleshooting

929
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,089
we're trying to return isolate the
problem because we've been having your

930
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:47,009
draft weekend

931
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:52,430
we just would like to to make sure that
elisa going west coast guard was a good

932
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,140
reason

933
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:58,160
issues location and probably my just
looking for a man tried to get connected

934
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:04,799
right ackerman on okay so I'm

935
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,480
while she's doing that continue to
question USA was please wait

936
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,710
go ahead anyway

937
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:15,730
if you call the you reach number with
star 67

938
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:20,760
you can you are calling from that and
the it'll show that in a number as the

939
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,569
as the number that you calling from so
it's gonna be needed for ten your

940
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:24,170
business

941
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:30,109
and second working be fine as UPS
uniforms online to know if you

942
01:01:30,109 --> 01:01:33,970
if you set up your you reach number you
call forwarded to cell phone be

943
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:38,420
in you call Fort cell phone a to Iran it
at that that will unblock

944
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,720
yeah energy same bird not that popular

945
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,390
okay where you think if you just do a
star sixty sup

946
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:48,440
nose in a few wanna pretend to be like a
business or something and you call

947
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,869
somebody is soliciting can information
that works well because you come in

948
01:01:51,869 --> 01:01:55,280
from an 877 arena for some like that RC
okay

949
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,480
yet another and is pretty cheap so it's
all good thank you

950
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:07,480
flow for the information by Kevin comes
going to leave pretty soon so I'm hoping

951
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:09,310
it's

952
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:12,810
she said please wait again they say
please wait every now and then

953
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:17,040
on Chester whenever she calls when she's
late for work after I was trying to do I

954
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,150
was trying to ask for that that
information register call in sick

955
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:23,550
sometimes it doesn't work you know
sometimes you don't get the information

956
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,400
that you want in

957
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,569
sometimes they protect you know it
really is not something that you think

958
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:28,779
they're protect that

959
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:32,859
that that aggressively it's just their
location phone number

960
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:36,009
and I we already know the location
another in Miller

961
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:39,270
so while ideally like to get is the
address

962
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:42,569
the call center number the phone number
are but

963
01:02:42,569 --> 01:02:45,410
job when I was going on over there
minimalism and what I mean is a Manila

964
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:46,149
it's pretty

965
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:49,670
damn later something are so it could be
a long way

966
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:56,020
butts you my one x suggested the

967
01:02:56,020 --> 01:03:00,060
supervisor that their call volume a go
through the roof NASCAR lol

968
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:04,630
yes mister unfav that is unlike I have a
super bike and the line market and will

969
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:09,069
try to get some information for you but
yeah he cannot guarantee at I just want

970
01:03:09,069 --> 01:03:09,900
you to be with you

971
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,920
happy with it would help us tremendously
troubleshooting we just need to know a

972
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,200
any kind of the eighty or even the
address would help us just fine

973
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,780
database in that way we could we could
stop the problem continuing and I miss

974
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:23,300
williams I'm

975
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,460
this initialing him from speaking with
yes guidelines for MCI

976
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:31,210
Anna mark american express I'm said you
actually doing some troubleshooting

977
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:35,050
fine we're trying to find out that white
calls that are supposed to be going to

978
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,319
Miller going to mine

979
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,599
stead we think it might be offset by one
I am we do is we can isolate this

980
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,920
by i'm looking get the car ready numbers
database

981
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:49,280
we have Mumbai we don't have an hour

982
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,450
is there any kind information you can
give us a call center number

983
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:57,250
be helpful well I think the best thing I
can actually do cannot make sure how to

984
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:57,619
fix

985
01:03:57,619 --> 01:04:00,980
thing on each have worked with Hannah
with their

986
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,109
and operations management there and see
if I can get chewed their

987
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:09,190
specialist in SF maybe have to ask the
question okay with act which is just

988
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:10,380
people to give me an address

989
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,830
because we probably have that
information as well and address

990
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:17,609
yet to see the address for call centers
for that way we can look into database

991
01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:22,098
OKC you end up back now increased which

992
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:26,160
77 and one half-percent try green but I

993
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,890
where manana with each the him in Mumbai
I can't now

994
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:35,160
are you in Manila right now now I'm not
having drinks be increased or was I just

995
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,190
speaking to an hour

996
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:40,569
you were yes also transfer over to to
Greensboro backscatter as hoping to

997
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:41,020
avoid

998
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,170
because an hour crossing the planet
again I

999
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:47,890
all right for you you have a a direct
dial number of Renmin a lot warmer

1000
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:51,819
by I can't that's why I'm have get
chemistry

1001
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:55,920
say we've me back somebody gas etc

1002
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,589
okay my special in with the council I'm
situation okay with me

1003
01:05:01,589 --> 01:05:04,910
are spectacular thank you thing about
Pizza

1004
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:08,190
ordering it right with her as you can
see it's a big long journey around the

1005
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,490
world sometimes the information these
people but damn

1006
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:13,790
if they if they give us information in a
timely manner reliable the

1007
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:18,700
to get it here it's not like the movies
were everything happens like 123

1008
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:22,680
sometimes you have to be really patient
take a long time yeah

1009
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,839
and sometimes it doesn't work at all
sometimes you get busted

1010
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,109
I mean guys haven't I saw where not me

1011
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:33,069
all yeahh help

1012
01:05:33,069 --> 01:05:36,240
look like because of the panel by remind
people about

1013
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,510
we have just been social engineered
because I deposit does golden's panel

1014
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:40,800

1015
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,109
sometimes wanna be on stage ok

1016
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:49,109

okay we're gonna put a two-minute

1017
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:52,589
limit on this because we are the people
that have to get on here at five

1018
01:05:52,589 --> 01:05:55,869
arm as 512 right now

1019

help her

1020
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:03,930
okay yes can I help you I yeah I've got
wise men say I we've just been trying to

1021
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,470
isolate the problem that that was
reported in Mumbai

1022
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:10,319
for for running calls apparently the
problem was that

1023
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:13,540
the 800 was going to Manila which should
have been going to

1024
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:17,520
by we're just trying to locate the
circuits here

1025
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,790
attend let me actually get on Mar 6 p.m.
Department online

1026
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:25,490
they're actually do you need to talk to
can help families don't have the ID

1027
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:29,270
year that all week I don't even know
where your

1028
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:32,750
roderick I'm sorry I i direct dial
number for

1029
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:36,000
that way we can just look it up in are
gonna look up table

1030
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,660
in the database just make sure it's
currently probably I don't know

1031
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:46,080
let me give 6 p.m. on the line to be
home for me ok

1032
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,100
we're getting a nice little tour
American Express

1033
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:54,230
it's not it's not unusual to go through
six seven eight nine ten levels and to

1034
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,860
provide

1035
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:58,120
before you really reach the information
you need to really have to persevere

1036
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,630
I've got asking what my the planet he's
in knows where he is

1037
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:07,660
you might be in New York with a new
American Express Forward card

1038
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:11,280
you'll be automatically enrolled in our
Wiley playing with Iran's

1039
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,680
an earn double points at the Greater
London going on

1040
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:21,120
him thank you for having actual
centralized call management yes my pic

1041
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,520
standing hi Scott Wiseman see I was just
trying to isolate the problem in New

1042
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:26,690
York it was reported

1043
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:30,020
by where word the calls are being routed

1044
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:34,810
improperly we think we can stop this
just with the ID

1045
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:41,810
item by norman Miller you have that
information ass I am NOT we have a

1046
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:43,930
problem with

1047
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:48,770
routing you what's happening is that
calls this post be going to Mumbai

1048
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:53,400
going to Manila and vice versa at it's
not affecting customers

1049
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,090
but it is affecting when winds are
getting tied up to going to the wrong

1050
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:58,860
place

1051
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:03,000
and you might get some circuits busy as
a result of that I'll we can probably

1052
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,380
fix is just by having the ID number

1053
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,640
correlating to 100 so either at the ID
from

1054
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:15,029
Mumbai with the idea from would be
helpful and I don't have to be I D

1055
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:19,280
for their I have an IPM number that's as
far as we would contact

1056
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,279
okay want to give me that K which one do
you want

1057
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,710

1060
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,260
an issue that needs to be resolved that

yet has just been reported in the last
half hour came when is your name again

1068
01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:17,920

for some reason

1073
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,830
when they ask for a ticket number you
can't just make one up either cuz it

1074
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:48,620
they're usually a set number of digits

question I love ticket number

01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,190
you handle it the right way you wanna
you want to avoid

1079
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:03,380
giving the wrong information better that
require the issue and just add change

1096
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:13,860
we have something like six or seven
people working on this now and I don't

1097
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,350
know what this is

1098
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:22,230

1100
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:29,500
happy needy intervention via social and
technical hacking

1101
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,920

long screw up the schedule

1103
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:43,280
so I guess it's ok it's worth seeing so
I recommend you stay

1104

any other questions as a waiting on hold
with american express their questions

1105
01:11:59,909 --> 01:12:01,938
panetta please try to keep it down back
there cuz

1106
01:12:01,939 --> 01:12:05,429
kinda hard to explain to people why
there's a crowd on a phone call

1107
01:12:05,429 --> 01:12:09,459
please ask questions so it doesn't
appear

1108
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:15,010
so dull how many people here consider
themselves social engineers at one point

1109
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:15,709
another they've done

1110
01:12:15,709 --> 01:12:20,469
rage and slow out that's it mother bear
and if you haven't done yet it's it's

1111
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:23,649
as long as you keep it safe it's just a
fun thing sometimes some are you

1112
01:12:23,649 --> 01:12:26,050
socially engineered all your parents
before

1113
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:31,019
come on all those hand should be up

1114
01:12:31,019 --> 01:12:34,269
it's a good skill to have because you
can get into places that you need to get

1115
01:12:34,269 --> 01:12:34,909
into

1116
01:12:34,909 --> 01:12:38,409
chemical engineer Italian market when
they call my part in that unlike

1117
01:12:38,409 --> 01:12:40,239
somebody else somehow with assault

1118
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,999
9 not no hello

1119
01:12:43,999 --> 01:12:49,938
there okay

1120
01:12:49,939 --> 01:12:52,470
I heard something arm

1121
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:56,540
there was something where they say

1122
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,100
knows me closing by their

1123
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:04,619
I was me

1124
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:07,679
cutting back home but read my lips are
the

1125
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,539
the question was can you such as their
telemarketers not sure exactly where how

1126
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:16,090
what you want them to believe about you
that your psychopath or something at the

1127
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:16,639
I

1128
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:20,469
you have a telephone Butler right into
help rid don't you could convince them

1129
01:13:20,469 --> 01:13:23,230
that they're calling the wrong number
and so that they could take you off the

1130
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:23,559
list

1131
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:27,010
they don't care about landed on whatever
number there or a dollar dials

1132
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:29,699
the thing is you want to piss them off
too much for some there's a calling for

1133
01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:31,010
maximum security prisons

1134
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:35,090
because they give the workout to two
inmates and they have your number and

1135
01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:37,489
they have your address and maybe they'll
get out Sunday

1136
01:13:37,489 --> 01:13:40,770
