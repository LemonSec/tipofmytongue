1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,439
each other man we'll be talking about
network security through adversity

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,540
operating systems

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,689
before we begin I want to make two
announcements first

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,429
lockpicking sessions going on right now
in room third area

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,700
8 on the second floor to be a beginner
section

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,710
and that'd be in Section incurs to bring
your own locks

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:22,490
the other announcement is were looking
for help with the AV system so if you

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,910
have it a/v experience

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,990
if you don't know if he is you probably
don't qualify so

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,480
right especially camera people so if you
have any that experience would like to

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,090
help out you can just talk to anyone and
in a beast and

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,399
I'm preferably when the most busy
without further ado

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,660
and government as ago on clearing up the
AOA

14
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,610
yeah prevent the

15
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:55,610
the line audio were

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,110
re: so my name is Adam

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,420
or job man I'm going to be talking about
topic

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,559
dahmer's systems

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,710
Yap not so what

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,640
generally inspired this work a you want
to bring the part number back up

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,990
the more do it

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,440
so sowetans by this work twin spires
work is a

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,550
I eventually want to graduate from
school and higher

24
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,509
on the research so a

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,500
and also make your security so like the
cavity search computer security problems

26
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,910
which is a good idea and so like

27
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,460
dimension India what we learn from
biology

28
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,580
that defied your security me arsons
secured

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,560
and so IP lookup biological systems

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,850
in general biological systems survived

31
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,950
not as individuals bus populations it
doesn't matter if any one of us dies in

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,540
a car wreck

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,770
erase all content by whole

34
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,500
minute have large numbers of people
survive and breed

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,340
make new copies of us said are freeze
yep

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,370
upon and front genetic stamp individuals
are

37
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,890
cry with variable from one person to
another a

38
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,700
but where someone up there with gestures
languages and

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,360
your procreate mostly live together as a
society without

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,860
too many dramatic workers or things

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,330
so its commissioner

42
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,890
that very minor changes in our an
Arduino very small

43
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,790
%uh differences one person to another
device used

44
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,709
probably dusty honest and darwinism says
I'd

45
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,920
people and genetic illnesses different

46
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,140
in a long time ago because these things
are are

47
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,599
ball tonight exit to help us

48
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,840
but there has been some logical
reasonable I'd stings actually

49
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,930
exist are genetic code

50
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,219
are really a program placings has been
passed down from generation to

51
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:01,930
generation

52
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,180
humanity so

53
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,879
a very basic example is single gene
deletion

54
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,950
so on chromosome 7 there's a surgeon
called CFTR

55
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,209
a which depressive three base pairs

56
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,319
orgy Press previous page rice's

57
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,939
were different you know assets a and so
people have a single gene deleted

58
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,370
okay on one their problems are on over
there chromosomes

59
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,680
two pairs cronyism from daddy service
very devastating disease

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,819
called cystic fibrosis and I think we
have a

61
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:40,659
I think people I don't Station iss.

62
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:45,060
would you like to share something with
the class young man

63
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,949
I it over freebasing

64
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:54,459
that's wonderful %uh so %uh

65
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:57,790
okay so anyway there's just if you loses
jeaner

66
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,900
this three base pairs on two chromosomes

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,299
did this horrible disease called cystic
fibrosis which hours

68
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:08,329
is pretty devastating and tragic you
think that you know that

69
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,090
in the UN Population this will disappear
long time ago cuz people usually go at

70
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,599
the city's to make it to you to be able
to reproduce

71
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:21,599
'em and again if we take a look at a %uh
what ends up happening is that a

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,169
people with cystic fibrosis though going
to be one of these

73
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:30,599
gene answers get his ago manage and is
very sore bashers no genetic disease

74
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,650
where only one base pairs leaped

75
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,539
where teaching is to NA inside the DNA

76
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,460
sequence on that one a change perhaps in
the

77
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,388
its code of into our name up

78
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:49,300
there's a single colour plans happening
is that the human hemoglobin changes

79
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,219
from very messy will ship molecule

80
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:54,400
day data maintained a structure at all
times

81
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,000
on under various conditions from today
looks like this: him

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,120
version A to something along the shape

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,810
version include version be and other
people who have this

84
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,430
market was up what's of sickle cell
anemia where

85
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,159
we had his red blood cells as a observe
oxygen come very rigid

86
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:16,389
formed and people s capillaries very
well

87
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,710
but as these cells give up their oxygen

88
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,810
I day become a shape in and start

89
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,620
clogged the orders so this is a

90
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,240
his cap places pretty pretty shitty

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,430
lot genetic lot but happens to people
and

92
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,979
we have to ask ourselves blindly single
these very minor changes

93
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,000
energy no which you think have no no
survivability

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,610
advantage why they continue to exist

95
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,479
and basically people s the sea

96
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,060
CTR mutational one chromosome or chrome
retiring and scholar

97
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,289
the reason why is because it is calcium
channels which line the law

98
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,330
and also rebels and so these calcium
channels

99
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,570
a prep you know correct balancing salt

100
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,550
ludington people who a

101
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,710
if they have the single gene mutation
have far less if these things

102
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,138
no longer able survivin operate a

103
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:25,099
cuz and fashion by

104
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,199
if the have

105
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,219
the to these mutations a

106
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:35,690
develop cystic fibrosis bells we have
ways mutations or chrome

107
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,130
resistance again recessing scholar which
is easy for you huge amounts water will

108
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,650
flow

109
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,219
from the body across the down

110
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,539
Paso body and sick people and hollered
dive

111
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:51,330
dehydration everything else so

112
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,250
in Northern Europe where looks like
missus audiences from

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,210
stay away usually your

114
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,210
I think so too Kevin so

115
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,819
hey Goa so

116
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,090
a to single gene mutation which gives

117
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,250
raisa survivability amongst 'em

118
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,949
amongst people from northern Europe who
who who have always one problem but if

119
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,979
their children if they both these jeans
a denim

120
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,479
dying so so this is so

121
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,610
so the again it's a is a disorder but
there's an edge to it this minor change

122
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,719
gives rise avenging his residence hall
earns

123
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,520
again sometime factions fixation similar
fashion

124
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,150
um individuals with the the a

125
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,340
with sickle cell anemia we resistance
against malaria

126
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,159
which discourage people from sub-saharan
Africa now

127
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,020
in the human population a there seems to
be some more evidence board

128
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,690
for resistance against SARS and a on HIV

129
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,520
so you BJP became serious I'm

130
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,409
much mercer's and X days now a 12
percentage of population which

131
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,849
a and in the same way I SARS which you
know God you turn out to be a tension as

132
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:14,310
being this horrible disease

133
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,210
there are certain people there our
covers assignments are said to them so

134
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,500
called so and because if you want are
sissies that

135
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,629
human variation we come across the
TARDIS diseases

136
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,509
home so said

137
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,940
these genetic variations which give rise
at heritage sees

138
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,260
also give us a lot resistance to deport
breaks

139
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,640
and pathogens which which

140
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,929
would take one person and what about but
the Maori

141
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:49,290
they cause no sickness whatsoever in
saunas again this is truly JB

142
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,360
their prostitution Africa not trackage

143
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,560
their use against wanted to tell you
population

144
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,649
cell our own differences will see

145
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,550
for a race I'll so million think stress
here

146
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,170
your perspectives customers we have
inherent weird

147
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,310
the population needs resistance in some
individuals but not

148
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,959
others so in general the system survives
for the individual's mind

149
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,470
so so every

150
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,770
when generalizing furthers by William
all biological systems company

151
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:30,319
responses huge number ten check em your
number different kinds of influences

152
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:33,779
environmental or pathological or
microbial

153
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,510
a up

154
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,230
a ok

155
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,860
have defended fight at the time they
fire genetic variations

156
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,180
%uh so when genetic diversity decreases
however

157
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,279
a our resistance easy's dramatically
increases

158
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,890
which Scout logical and so we haven't
seen at

159
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,470
really any kinda national system later a
biological system

160
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,240
passages the human population cover
small number

161
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:11,459
such as European Jews tay-sachs things
like that and Pennsylvania Dutch

162
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,610
homage where

163
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,380
where is really after trying on a back
road bike

164
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,410
%uh so a said these disorders

165
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,510
a which it when you have this limited
population said up

166
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,959
to genetic diversity a derisive people
in wins actually very easy

167
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:37,110
agricultural practices a so haven't you
hear Irish

168
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,709
okay so to the reason why I we are in
this country is a

169
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,779
a mercy because the my name

170
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,439
there in a book argues that the British
were kinda you know starving %uh so

171
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,699
we and absentee landlord is a man

172
00:10:53,699 --> 00:11:00,480
a whole the whole associate social
causes that came with being grouped into

173
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,000
famine

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,560
a referees but in reality the

175
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,500
the the poor frying practices the Irish
give rise to

176
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,800
a major pandemic crosser

177
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,819
stable and why why

178
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:21,420
why yeah

179
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,550
so anyways so this pathogen

180
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,900
a fungus went through and and and
demolishing tire

181
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,130
irishmen crossed the line because I plan
won't have to and

182
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,449
which and you last I mean I play alot I
play well capitata

183
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,260
stamped 80 years mix

184
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,949
so a

185
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:49,390
now down on my lessons add on online
sees things

186
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,569
their world rocks %uh so huh this

187
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:56,490
we only play one for potato very and so
when this pathogen keep their weight

188
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:56,760
down

189
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,809
interprets hi cutie poised to the ground
from storage in with a few weeks

190
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:05,029
the term black and rock and there's
store so where's

191
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,610
customarily that stay okay for months
%uh

192
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,189
this pathogen a rigid himself America
and South America didn't have a

193
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:16,670
dramatic genetic are dramatic genetic

194
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:20,750
failure crop failures Lake the Irish
winds the South Americans paid eighteen

195
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,370
different prize

196
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,309
to use a separate distinct genetically
diverse got it so

197
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:30,230
one of them was wiped out this store
1780s other food supply

198
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:36,010
a which is a major fractions on
something output district population

199
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,720
so the historian saying the great up
here famine

200
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,689
institute a global laws which prevented
a anything like this from ever happening

201
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:45,010
again across the history of humanity

202
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,079
for all farm practices

203
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,130
a which is other worship because

204
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,709
in the nineteen seventies view American
farmer

205
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:57,900
planted this straight up high yield porn

206
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,209
and the southern complete withdrawal
ripped through the entire

207
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,730
said a so so

208
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,880
we're really big on you know growing
corn for for for cattle feed

209
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,670
up the design were two strains evolve a
American time

210
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,079
and so when a pathogen hit it would go
for one

211
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,550
one farms in x1 x1 and just sprinkles
Hodges

212
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,910
forms and this isn't really tragic I
mean did

213
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,309
to talk to people whose profit margins
are 20003 does NARS

214
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:29,490
year and whose lyserød bank if fifty
percent

215
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,709
problems weighed on some occasions hun
to crops wiped out

216
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,140
that said there was the former and so a

217
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,809
about 30 percent were for those %uh view
not scientific notation two billion

218
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:45,000
so billion dollars other croppers lost

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,920
so the question is %uh are humans
appeared really that much different

220
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,959
from a from a system stamp a

221
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,630
and I really don't think they are
individuals both

222
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,420
a so getting carbon-based complex
systems

223
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,990
its for for human spending two years ago

224
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,279
mission peers been nine's man-hours a
four-step

225
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,850
and each humans composer

226
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,620
for each individual's here as a 92 lines
coder millions of

227
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,350
a lines amino acid base pairs

228
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,390
there really is no much tip and

229
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,770
populations a human beings interact

230
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,439
and these complex networks up operations
at Petersham iraqis complex

231
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:35,219
very similar very much a

232
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,800
indistinguishable a statistical fashion

233
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,839
just the way they interact and

234
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,439
so a lot of them has been made the
general sciences up next

235
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:50,149
recently and if I present a script to
sociologists say oh this is the rate at

236
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:50,579
which

237
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,179
on people interact with each other you
know this isn't this is like a a friend

238
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,529
of a friend network

239
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,709
a work I present it to a a

240
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,050
to a civil engineers %uh this is
distribution over City a

241
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,160
a sizes cities

242
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,699
across a time what I present to you know
a hydrologist

243
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:15,520
say something somewhere about water
tables missions and is actually a

244
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,189
extract from a craft about interactions

245
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:23,420
people over email unless Israel data and
what happens is causes

246
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,910
this this scale-free dispute shock again
scott free distribution is really in

247
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:27,850
general

248
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,029
but things much more interesting about
it is dead

249
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,800
%uh dead did the same statistical
patterns same interaction patterns

250
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,760
happen much biological systems

251
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,970
happen once computer systems enters very
very important

252
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,610
so a individuals from both groups get
sick

253
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,089
the because of laws are construction
human beings devices

254
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:55,220
computers a good bars because a faulty
and

255
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,370
strip so so it these problems are out

256
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,880
a and and when is prom to rub

257
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,079
a fixing it was kinda called our it's
nearly impossible right now to go

258
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,309
through so much genetic code and make a
single base-pair change

259
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:13,510
at the same time it's nearly impossible
to actually go in at fine air is echoed

260
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,390
try to patch together when applied

261
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,260
it it has happened yet to happen anytime
soon

262
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,150
so we can have two get to the point
where we reach really except

263
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,410
their is no way affects here's a secure
system always been secured human beings

264
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,459
always have

265
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:35,459
arson human beings always be in viable
from the stamp

266
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,839
so basic principle of computer security
through diverse

267
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,960
said is a computer systems should

268
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,240
a biological systems to become much more
smiled this

269
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,880
attack editors environmental to here

270
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,170
very mild adversity or something it's
man-made or something along those lines

271
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:00,980
J questions at this point I will follow
me so far

272
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:07,860
it's a dance dance help presented itself
%ah

273
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,100
snow

274
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,610
no no heavy coinage yeah

275
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,620
okay so what do a

276
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,790
mean by Emily a basically is coming
acceptance said

277
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,879
me though the system's you bring up
musical

278
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,030
to slow X so

279
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,910
we built the system's a what we're
trying to do a

280
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,410
we must stop focusing on trying to make
the individual

281
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,850
ultimately secured as near near
impossible okay

282
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:46,639
above what we do a among security

283
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,390
infrastructure to say that a every other
single system or something single his

284
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,830
singly vulnerable I have been prevent
this attack for spreading all over the

285
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,399
place

286
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,760
to the point where it becomes academic

287
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,040
annis did

288
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,710
there's been a lot of research where
people say that that they should emulate

289
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,890
biological systems for computing systems

290
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,990
lol the Research Center pine 'em

291
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,140
organic anion system research into a a
self months of recognition

292
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,200
and other circuits good yields a

293
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,890
work rain but already is true biological
system emulators any further problems

294
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,750
are from on

295
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,480
from a ass off lots of recognition
standpoint

296
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,160
I used to go unrecognized change the
file you that a large population about

297
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,550
change at the same time a you're stopped
attacking Mitt holiday

298
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:44,210
him mid mid point a way that the price
go

299
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,340
catechal so

300
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,189
a from epidemics ten-point I

301
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,300
humans and computers get

302
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,350
genetics I mean we have the slammer worm
is a former

303
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,410
epidemic or the other major internet

304
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,750
enables buyers -ism I camp else

305
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,150
yes sasser else out there

306
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,730
stone virus as less when I got stones

307
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,060
that I custom I got stern buyers as a
boot sector

308
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,169
pic because I'm straight edge I'm I'm

309
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,840
I'm like that a so a

310
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,250
and for those of you who do not remember
what stars was a boot sector virus a way

311
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,920
to spread

312
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,300
was that people would put floppy disk
into drive as before

313
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,790
hard drives and their way to a turn on a
computer and spread the other disk

314
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,480
other floppy drive a and so

315
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,660
mean using her opinions to rebut these
biological systems

316
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,910
%uh involving the same

317
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,420
breeze Parsons me about these these two
verses

318
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,929
tech tricks to the bars is a mars bout

319
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,600
to kinda to get injured our weaknesses
in the same time

320
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,270
a we have populations I think we went up
by like

321
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,480
mission against to crop and

322
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,530
other problems like that Jamie ICU
leaving

323
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,330
so populations

324
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,520
and ang to being systems which have been
wiped out

325
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,060
%uh a long time ago or kept in place by
law at Markit Economics

326
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,370
which a menu %um house

327
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,390
cool but I basically a all

328
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,800
if security whiz an economic sandwich
truly

329
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,960
is when as a security problem people to
spend money

330
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,179
hand over fist kinda eliminate

331
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,250
issue manpower downtime or along those
lines

332
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,220
I love these economic pushes

333
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,190
the with sets a cave near which runs a
means of secure

334
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,980
because there's no other another name a
game that's kinda it up so

335
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,050
what we do to diversify systems where

336
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,480
economics now allows to actually run
something that's

337
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,590
completely heard so

338
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,970
this job principles describes our
position papers a

339
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,770
I think Shang paper is a

340
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,860
hours and tell her genius networking and
new paradigm in security or something

341
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,380
like that

342
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,350
does tank year Road a paper

343
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,809
were security conference and you guys

344
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,840
home swelled so you're fired

345
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,730
estate for and a have her

346
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:36,320
and then okay there's a paper came up in
the

347
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,570
like the last article section a
simplification such cargo

348
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,129
by step but the idea the risks
monocultures

349
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:44,280
fiercest

350
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,180
and busy that the race team have a
saying that that the

351
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,260
active having a monopoly makes the area
is secure

352
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,080
and is kinda if you can prove that
statement

353
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,960
there's a lot of bed that second that
busy says that no

354
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,520
day debt ultimate argument against a
Microsoft

355
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,230
me every one home and secure Homeland
Security a

356
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,510
day we need to a

357
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,820
eliminates monoculture we had
diversified desperate things

358
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,260
and so and so

359
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,660
yeah it's a hard again if proven it's a
hard thing that you don't like

360
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,330
courts basis as I that our military in
secured the only ones

361
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,540
sup so again there's

362
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,639
yes one touchdown for asylum

363
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,360
again these are all neighbor surveilled

364
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,790
yet the Google India IEEE and ACM like

365
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,330
stir wildly accessible

366
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,750
so a why is my message to you guys here
today to secure

367
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,440
for them bring changes to world and a
good

368
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,030
before then divers buyers software livor
standpoint

369
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:02,310
system standpoint and from are assembled
is a-ron different things

370
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:05,550
and do different things and to think
differently about fiercest

371
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,810
and so its should be the job security
key to

372
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,919
anchor jim forced a ver si a really by
any means necessary

373
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,020
because it is something that is making
our systems and secure

374
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,930
making our networks and secure from
global standpoint up

375
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,880
but me let's be honest only so many
names in a row to business

376
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,510
as i sorry things you're upset iowa's
really

377
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,720
United ross et les I mean a and

378
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,620
yes foundry but coupley a couple years
is a good product list

379
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,750
first highness juniper thank you your
runs Jennifer

380
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:46,090
yep help

381
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,639
a so to really implementing a couch
diversity a large killers

382
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,799
Ridge if you're your large knocked

383
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,350
and you can be running I less then going
into people cross trained on

384
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,490
down failure jennifer's

385
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,570
yes expensive something cuz im breaks he
may not have that person on staff at

386
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,689
that moment I'm

387
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,860
educator insist so week I need to keep
these

388
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,330
interfaces much the same but same time
it is

389
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,460
these dramatically different associate

390
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,740
to prevent security breakdowns so

391
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,720
their order we think about the first
bank system signature

392
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,990
it under manual and automatic worked for
automatic systems

393
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,549
sons Saunders Tucson goes on around

394
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:35,230
and on taxes will be abusive now rumors
colors

395
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,340
arts section taken some software

396
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,908
shop sumpter mix-up

397
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:45,000
a question so forth going

398
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
yes up

399
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,120
you're exactly correct now you're
exactly correct

400
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,000
and a but but we've reverse engineer
stairs before

401
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,149
bus on I mean something was amazing I
wasn't as great publish there was

402
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:12,990
something someone sat down for six years

403
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,679
back in it something is different and so
now this too is doing this motion

404
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,700
itself a for me there's there's this
legions of people out there

405
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,000
regions a doing but at least two people
got the drum

406
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,620
but these two people out there who are
more than habits down reverse engineer

407
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,049
protocol because again nothing else
bettered

408
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:36,200
up

409
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,659
that them criticizing the very concept
the you reverse engineering stuff I

410
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:40,399
think that these

411
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,570
up

412
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,090
thank you

413
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:53,090
%ah up

414
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,170
help

415
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:05,580
month up

thank you mack so like

417
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,810
'em so so what the job I did

418
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,120
me out overseas as mayor replication
functionality a

419
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,930
in a a comp 61 having so

420
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,620
yeah I know I'm going on where you sit
12 ounce curls nowadays

421
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:31,380
Beijing counters anymore hope

422
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,090
I a person be on Mac

423
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:40,240
hit him Pierre up

424
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,150
home and I so again at me know diversity
is busy in your menu

425
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,430
male replication functionality in hong
kong

426
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,130
and so were some samples other the true
the obvious examples web browsers

427
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,560
where up there are there Punia

428
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,629
a up their party browser there for the
okay

429
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,520
stamp topics I mean a.m.

430
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,860
buser came out swinging as I anymore
it's not because

431
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,330
its my classic on so up

432
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,840
apart %uh a car a car back

433
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,950
I so a

434
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,900
she won't mind us iight up

435
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,900
there's a big alert the game offers
services in each stock using I

436
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,680
reading wage sup using it's not because
I is less secure than anything else on

437
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,470
me I'm sure that

438
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,100
boxing I'm sure that I am that

439
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,100
them is ill and all the other printer
thereafter as me

440
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,870
street from there as I he does the
promise because it's

441
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,260
ninety-five percent it appears that
their use it you're going to invest time

442
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,830
nothing exploit appeared as a hundred
hours developing that's what haiiii

443
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,550
person walk

444
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,680
saw which ones do you think a bank trip

445
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:52,020
yeah biggest and developers ones and so

446
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,280
this is a very simple very easy to munch

447
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,410
example wage up %ah

448
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,480
also using on stamp volumes a as much as
we going to use Fla

449
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,360
user Brazil or users Safari or Firefox

450
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,110
use our using Flash the using

451
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,250
flash Sun comes up next week against
blacks or something like that doesn't

452
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,870
matter what browser using still it's

453
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,830
sales so like me think

454
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,360
this is cautious why me think that
you're your the first on your system

455
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,020
and where your stock not because de
Jersey single ivers

456
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:31,930
and so observe the airport this

457
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,050
was it gonna Heights OH

458
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:40,320
yet for this is that we wish a rocket
libraries up

459
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,200
therefore the written telling you a more
secure way using telling you more secure

460
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,520
for

461
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,580
mines up and assign as a love all that
is holy place open SSL

462
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,679
because I know MA have us a program has
now been a South

463
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,389
okay I may have a slight dip

464
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:01,559
exactly %uh both isn't just the APIs
problem

465
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,918
there's a lot of bugs and openness you
feed the wrong input

466
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:05,400
and

467
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,010
and stuff search dumping very often and
when things core dump it usually means

468
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,310
you know uses segmentation violation
there's something bad there

469
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:20,310
skirt dumping

470
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,980
I want to get the prevailing

471
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,390
latest point so to be very good if we
could actually

472
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,790
going up replace open a cell because

473
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:42,750
for old people out there say all on
romantic someone an open associations is

474
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,890
not commercial business it's not a
commercial is the sages got more secure

475
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,800
Obama block

476
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,220
that portions the reason why is because

477
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,800
because Apache OpenOffice cell Apache SH

478
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,580
all this occurred the name clients
everything else want to come as one

479
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,710
single livor

480
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,760
and whenever is a problem does one
single ivory won't be too much about it

481
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,660
difficult concept to go manipulate this
attack to actually start attacking other

482
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,090
other applications that use the same i
right a

483
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:14,230
and again it I know some people a

484
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,290
I mean we all know so anyway he said he
sat down and said August

485
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,059
for for shits and grins I go on on it ok
nacelle and he found

486
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:27,010
eight major probs aggressively some the
Sept experts from skins

487
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,809
back pocket but you know open SSL is so
many problems

488
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:34,928
less skilled professionals on the go
look at it ok pick it apart like crazy

489
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:41,929
the question

490
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,940
yet

491
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,260
oh yes a easy way to mention the item
id: does attacks a

492
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:57,150
so as going into action later but next
on

493
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,040
so wassup reactivate his are to first
itself

494
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,210
I mean if there's a problem with the
these the I miss wood

495
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,090
likes working on this weekend is this
network up a

496
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,230
a reactive access points even having a
reactionary Iran's

497
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,330
because every single system free and
want the same reaction algorithm

498
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,899
you find a prominent reactionary out for
them then every single system goes down

499
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,810
so a so implement so

500
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,169
and their big promise a reading a Park
secure parser

501
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,170
is really freaking hard a

502
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,510
I mean I'm a fucking around reading a
reading it

503
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,360
ok having people said entire area of all
parser for

504
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,400
person somewhere for TCP IP and see

505
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,090
thank you think they did it right I

506
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,570
is incredibly difficult and this is why
there's all those

507
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,700
attacks came out a couple years ago
teardrop

508
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,840
hearts Williams teardrop bong

509
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,530
yeah using said

510
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:01,649
and it wasn't because because sons were
so terrible you know there's a reason

511
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,490
attack not

512
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,040
really really really hard to do and if
we only have like

513
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,550
a couple code base other if the code is
on that exist to

514
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,370
to duties get the stack parsing is
Windows and Linux

515
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:17,210
this is bad because what happens is that
one song is a find a problem

516
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,770
wanting very long pentagon code up a
massive now serves tactic

517
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:24,000
you know of bringing things down we saw
this week I'll yes

518
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,010
every time there's I was problem people
go in a you know

519
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:31,530
the crap defense and a reason why is
because because it is a major problem

520
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:31,910
with

521
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,340
with with the tease hippie parser for

522
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,620
BGP or something like that are for some
dollars on to circumvent

523
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,670
all these all mechanisms and they have
and i OS two do

524
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,760
authentication on on her beach P packets

525
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,270
leading to bring in a link that's to the
core the Internet so

526
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:54,230
so for many if you are in the school or
something like that a good idea for same

527
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,630
price is down to rewrite an ass 1

528
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,570
sn1 parser some crazy ass language and a

529
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,169
go graduated so

530
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,480
up so in general I think that and their

531
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,910
golfer it would be make it very very
easy to write different operating system

532
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,570
all diff kinda hard wearing only a few
basic basic requirements because not

533
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,290
everyone wants to download limits

534
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,580
not everyone is the same a

535
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,820
in that they don't use computer sync
music appears unused

536
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,760
appears get work done this very specific
they have project sector

537
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,040
Park that are you know self a

538
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,379
yeah

539
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,990
don't look back snipers project in its

540
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:38,830
a day one use computers to communicate
with you will be emailed to tomorrow

541
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,900
scientific problems

542
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,120
and they don't spend all their days Mary
Helen store

543
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,130
vst3 for on a a and sexy game

544
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,630
should it just up

545
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,020
pains Miami friends excluded but a

546
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,160
a user so so allies %uh princess

547
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,320
the reason like my saying that ya na
pics for example I think Knox is a cause

548
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,040
fucking thing

549
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,600
ever the fact that someone took this
this this piece of software that

550
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,680
dead on offer you more members 1x back
in 94 was a pain yes again aiming at

551
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,120
work

552
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,630
and they actually went name their
resolve everything down to a single CD

553
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,420
that that one

554
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,880
detectives you shiver feature sets on
one platform granted

555
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,910
budged Robin pretty much always works
three reference not work

556
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:29,909
to break

557
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,469
hey

558
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,990
the or more energy more energy

559
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,320
faster yet

560
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,040
you jerking 248 given a talk at
communications

561
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,259
I yeah

562
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,510
you so %uh again in

563
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,320
yeah hey so you wanna make citizens are

564
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,990
easy use for the beginner so everyone
got out the same rather just the nerds

565
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,850
%uh said don't other e-mail we'll do
things are completely new and so here's

566
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,009
the craziest ideas

567
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,619
like but the house have my screen out

568
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,240
up

569
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,180
don't suffer reinvent the wheel %uh run
crypto streams the GP you i mean you get

570
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,259
this vector processor you go in certain
you know

571
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,670
gym in like you know 64 C five streams
to your

572
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,670
a your video porn your the rebel

573
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:40,010
but up the good thing about is that you
be alone you know be a fling open to

574
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,140
sell very quickly

575
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,868
%uh and research going to get hardware
to live moored

576
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:49,250
design methodology using using using
hardware systems

577
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:55,510
is a lot more pussy sites his is very
much formalize and so life sciences

578
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:59,330
from Xerox are so much different from
from sauce offers different

579
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:03,420
makes it hard for people attack %uh
desire to fear of getting back into him

580
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,869
apart

581
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:07,720
divisions believes the machines are when
you have a hell of more difficult

582
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,950
an excellent actor to use it analyze
from that from the

583
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,779
power design perspective the close all
the state transitions

584
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:21,420
from a sixty a mortgage or competitions
but passing out opticians

585
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,530
over MPI terminals cubicle staffed by

586
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:27,990
romanians brought over air selection a

587
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,030
day a because

588
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:37,859
those eastern block your injury can you
mad a yeah 'em

589
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,920
so the caveat as much as I want everyone

590
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,320
to do something completely different %uh
don't build

591
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,430
different API citizen accent if you go
in you makes the say oh we're gonna make

592
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,600
Jinyu a SSL and sky has brand new API

593
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,230
you're gonna have slow adoption because
everyone has

594
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,430
open SL code out there Mb really really
cool

595
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,759
is they had a full open a cell you know
interface layer this completely

596
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,230
compatible so all you do is change the
link flag high alert settings

597
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,050
and that would be nifty so that way you
have always been also just running

598
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,290
Apache they're able to run

599
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,470
yeah at you from a seller able right now
a

600
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,369
Apache with you now veggie SL

601
00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,270
or something like that room hand and
have something I'll be a little more

602
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:28,020
attacking you would be awesome little
better in mind every single time in open

603
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,560
a cell viability comes out

604
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,230
a and also in general

605
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,380
people like to have the same interface
over and over and over one reason why

606
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,220
haha program

607
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,350
recipes same general API's

608
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,770
as Mac 68k program Michael system 6

609
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:49,280
looks similar wasn't two different and
so you will have a lot of people came

610
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,140
from one environment

611
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,410
come over to the the Palm Pilot for

612
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,129
start working on us missus dish could
wear in

613
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:00,460
and entire ride his right now but still
a so

614
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,350
working are served by some we're gonna
say allies can often the fault-tolerance

615
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:05,960
community

616
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,280
a and they have advocated using these
techniques for fault-tolerance

617
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,109
for keep your security now hack rhea

618
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:17,590
do it and automatic fashion as we do
this we do the robot

619
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:24,590
yeah

620
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,450
yeah

621
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,450
so

622
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,980
outer that exist which can a on average
is very built into multiple levels

623
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,970
obsessive behavior

624
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,849
and

625
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:39,930
and some this examples

626
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,848
ok aliens so during this like a

627
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:49,809
so the what Wenger proposed in this
paper

628
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:54,380
which again you look up on the Google a
is that the kid

629
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:58,140
rejection is kinda and sings it comes in
a discussion at lunch

630
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,769
now this is a touchdown architecture
which are going to arrive code structure

631
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:06,220
from are source code and Jerry and
directed graph that describes coach

632
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,749
structure

633
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:10,960
ball gone I love

634
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,549
right and let out

635
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:18,380
a so so

636
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,690
the jericho structure from from jerry is
a graph search

637
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,009
on the source code and they woulda

638
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:29,630
going to random manipulations to you
ordered binary decision trees but still

639
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,489
maintain a general structure the code

640
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:34,950
%uh so as to introduce renovation and
said

641
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,910
causes the Dame is a graph-theoretic
statements because it's two things are

642
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,170
equivalent to the code was

643
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,160
one still images agreement realizations
owe me a much more difficult to actually

644
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,390
to on attack

645
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,580
pieces code so work sets are subtle but

646
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:56,420
you pry descending by doing a reverse
engineering a binary into

647
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,110
a did directed grass and doing houses in
every second binary

648
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,770
to do manipulations who woulda thunk be
possible before this morning Hannah

649
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,400
a who woulda thought %uh

650
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,670
so another we're doing is a a

651
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,489
area

652
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:21,880
okay when I hit my head oh this is
actually from the

653
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,519
doctor next for me member to

654
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,720
yeah %uh so read my second section i won

655
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,039
method involves a insertion minimize
variable janitorial offering

656
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:38,180
frame this just show your ID a stack
guard you're gonna break your head open

657
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:42,980
she's stressed up

658
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,980
and and %uh and in this case attacker
must

659
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,670
I mean see question what supported

660
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:56,529
so

661
00:40:56,529 --> 00:41:00,840
so yeah

662
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,820
so having people over in a buffer
overflow here before that's

663
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,240
FedEx her rights help so

664
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,930
a so ally times in a ramp up her clothes
Mireya buffer

665
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,040
please quest accepted a way a.m. yes

666
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,279
I have an hour to kill so up

667
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,660
%uh so one theory about my guys 5s
alright a so what you are into a buffer

668
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,250
overflow

669
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,460
a a did you get this thing called

670
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,070
nose tackle send you too busy James and
a dentist thing in

671
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,540
and yet the bunch guess is that your and
my system is a lot harder

672
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,230
sauna going guess using attack over and
over I J dissenting first act he

673
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:41,990
protection

674
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,940
which will help a for kids is also the
problem

675
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,950
a heap overflow attacks and you do for
iran denies a

676
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,109
I just a single program return see
attacks which become more and more

677
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,560
popular since it was dark

678
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,080
deny excuse stacks a instruct you never
in my entire instruction set by putting

679

680
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,710
very high standard Azria register

681
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,160
and services Weiner analyzes every
structure comes through

682
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,940
yeses exhort at the same time you're
adding you now whatever that a

683
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,530
to TN a that's why every white dresser
is

684
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,080
that some instructions such a jury
random a

685
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,960
so this could be done I easily enough
runtime: emulation is a boxing to do in

686
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,869
are hardware system and a I'll let you
say oh you're adding you know additional

687
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:32,710
stage the processors it really is not
complex because your pipe lining and

688
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,510
nori the

689
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,740
instruction fetch instruction fetch
instruction decode stage

690
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,910
the processors pretty heavy pipelines a
service

691
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:45,080
papers and discuss that I can give your
listing afterwards

692
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,859
so frequently asked criticisms this just
security through obscurity

693
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:52,960
let's worship the reason lies difference
between Diversey an obscure yourself a

694
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,740
significant

695
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:59,700
'em and sturdy realized any to you is a
condom Martin cryptosystem people

696
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,240
really high the crypto algorithms and it
kinda close to my husband

697
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,880
not completely because %uh deadly they
keeping his attacker the system didn't

698
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,140
know be more secure

699
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,259
this Steven says that did nothing really
ought to make things in secure

700
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,040
to just try and make it things as
diverse as possible and to slow down the

701
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,609
attacker

702
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:22,210
another ackerson at this fucking a
practical and I can measures much

703
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:22,780
software

704
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,280
a ideally it is a complete repair
fashion we have been on a Mac tool which

705
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,910
can read my software images all its
diversity

706
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:34,040
and are descending libraries in a handle
pass major

707
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,369
pro-lifers the same time answer to be as

708
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:40,810
a.m. a a lot thanks for your quick
impractical

709
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:45,460
attachment is incredibly practical I
mean we see it time time again if you

710
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,619
don't go on catcher's

711
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,840
systems also how practical is having an
allied

712
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,490
our stack any questions first

713
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:59,490
applause for a our guest

714
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:03,910
on Russian

715
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:10,910
go he's not smoking anything's

716
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:15,430
all concerned of here and is high on
life

717
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:21,520
is high on the Jesus next question where

718
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,520
behind

719
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:39,350
out screaming

720
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:47,710
next question

721
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,990
head

722
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:53,400
and do it haven't had any is a vector
processor

723
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,420
is designed to do that communications a
lot of Kurdistan inspector

724
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:03,420
situations

725
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:07,520
no request open SSL

726
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,200
not a cell is a difference okay Evanna
cells in architecture

727
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:19,200
essays on architecture open ourselves in
Plantation replace implementation

728
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,180
we minor and the coat closet cole slaw

729
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,859
sont will exploit they were exploited
and people don't go on Pacha systems

730
00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:36,160
mean it yet is a the idea is that not
that

731
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,160
open ourselves every controversial point
between a perfect security tool because

732
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,250
as soon as they do

733
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,650
to come up with some kind new technology
is there something you expert

734
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,789
what a gala buffer things started of
Western attacks are happening

735
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:51,640
three goals of his other keep a overflow
taxer

736
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,460
and so who the hell knows could be next
but you know we're never gonna solve

737
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,339
problems

738
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:59,130
by

739
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,180
encouraging does work now arm

740
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,250
your ette said that you're encouraging
diversity om

741
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,880
in libraries by having a plaque at
Allaire in the toppling over SSL

742
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,039
arms but doesn't having a set standard
protocol

743
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:18,109
and a set standard API make design
restrictions

744
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,230
arm that France's deal of prior

745
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:25,319
I as: send out one parsing well on bill
is a team to affected a lot different

746
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,058
parsers

747
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:29,609
well I see your point but same to you
have standards something

748
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:33,410
up you had to have some for suresies
we'll have to have the same

749
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:37,470
for base pairs a genetic otherwise
mobile cr-z

750
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,940
chromosomes back

751
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,099
frasure yes

752
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:50,000
user yeah

753
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,839
now

754
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:01,839
okay me

755
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:11,460
there

756
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:25,780
but with with this had to do it
diversity

757
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:28,990
now it's a different issue in answering
organizational issue

758
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:32,450
and I agree with you richer more certain
vendors the same time to

759
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:39,450
as much a code diversity problem yes

760
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:51,650
up that's where my PhD research in
psychology i wanna talk about too much

761
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,319
answer

762
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:56,538
yet or did you know that we have been
there and

763
00:47:56,539 --> 00:48:00,499
don't said and the 28 a rare

764
00:48:00,499 --> 00:48:06,279
and your 0

765
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:09,680
good point %uh is commercial nature
licensing

766
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,348
Kipling against probably but do we have
a choice

767
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:16,749
I mean it's that's really it this comes
down to

768
00:48:16,749 --> 00:48:20,950
and if you will say let's see if
Robinson its on they will come out with

769
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,950
a system is as we have a license is your
life randomized perspire software

770
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,259
by strange maybe more secure the become
more commercially

771
00:48:28,259 --> 00:48:34,539
a appreciable so I can see as a
value-add

772
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:38,650
for organization next

773
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,660
shop

774
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:46,058
percent ok

775
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:53,059
are SMEs less question year

776
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:03,780
here

777
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,259
old yet by serious same doesn't be the
system-level

778
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:13,839
be the library muscle his lover's be
managed by Microsoft

779
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,970
there in a Kobe including the Microsoft
patch cluster right

780
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:21,499
and yes I make their the hatch chunks
larger the same time it doesn't have to

781
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:24,710
be something is completely doesn't have
to be that you know you had a

782
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:29,420
his system be done to live remember the
harsh level or something signs

783
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,979
I think that take less rest of line so

784
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:39,979
alright thank you %ah

785
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,169
but

786
