1
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,729
yes I'm number 128 or two

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,069
the seven to my friends am in civilian
life

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:10,150
I am Steven Kass I'm a senior associate
her with

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,730
IEEE Spectrum magazine and which is
published by IEEE

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,060
IEEE is kind of a large organization as
a whole lot of different kinds very

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,040
technical publishing

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,000
but we're more serb general interest
magazine and he might even find this

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,190
and on some them bookstores so

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,930
we're not like a trading on the future
and we are actually mainstream

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:37,930
I'm one thing I should say up to top is

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,489
Africa am

12
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,980
first thing is I'm here to talk with the
mainstream media I am NOT

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,930
the mainstream media I know many of you
have problems with the mainstream media

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,809
and and pubs to for individuals I'm not
those individuals

15
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,290
so if you have great anger at the media
is really not a huge amount appointed

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,729
taking it out on me as I know really in
a position to change the entire

17
00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:07,550
structure

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:14,550
am the industry so again you expect was
published by the IEEE we focus gently on

19
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,619
emerging technology we cover everything
from

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,280
gosh military airspace by medical
software development

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,110
energy semiconductors and just the
entire

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,750
waterfront and we refuse any thousand
subscribers worldwide

23
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,950
I personally am cover some other
computers allowed to do larger space

24
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,619
coverage

25
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,979
and M a lot kinda service journalism
aspects

26
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:41,369
so the first question is why bother with
the mainstream media you have a

27
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,289
situation now where hackers have

28
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,770
an unprecedented ability to get their
message out because you have the

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,300
Internet

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,039
damage the distribution shall I can
reach directly into any persons

31
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,209
and home is unique kinda connection
you've got

32
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:58,500
long as you've got video blogs you've
got podcasts so why even bother dealing

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,819
with all the house at the mainstream
media why bother dealing

34
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:04,610
fashion journalists why bother worrying
about your message being distorted

35
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,128
why worry about you know the pokey
spaces that they're going to be able to

36
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,840
give you inside their publications

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,260
why not just do everything yourself I
just published and

38
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,060
directly well mean answers because it
just like you robbing banks as for the

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,590
money is

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,770
answers that's where the audience is
only a tiny

41
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,410
chunk of podcasts and blogs have
sizeable audiences

42
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,680
I think the biggest one which is
actually competitor miss you media

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,730
am from the researchers have to look
around is the Daily Kos which is left

44
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,329
wing

45
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,530
am sir blog gets about

46
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,239
they claim by five million unique
visitors per week when you look at that

47
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,129
after that then there's huge drop-off

48
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,670
I think farrakhan going going are the
next level down and going going gets and

49
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,800
600,000

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,080
use per week you go to the next level of
that it's a huge

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,400
massive massive drop off and if you go
to

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,129
podcasts and the toll on repeat in US
have talent podcast last three days that

53
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,390
ten million people

54
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,340
and that's a figure from Nielsen
research I think they just updated

55
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,799
figure today so might be a little

56
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,260
a little off and so really you're
looking at

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,798
most blogs that you're gonna publishing
what I like you know

58
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,159
machines drive them are gonna have may
be few hun if you look at a few thousand

59
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,459
if you doing really well

60
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,749
am readers compare this with you
mainstream media figures

61
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:24,959
I'm biggest magazine United States I
apologize these figures are all very

62
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,019
US centric am is pray magazine which is
an insert witches and make newspaper

63
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,560
that goes inside Saudi newspapers around
the country

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,010
aniket it's the big bigger role on the
block as it gets 35.5 million readers

65
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,719
per issue

66
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,779
and every morning on today show that
25.5 many people chilean

67
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:46,319
at CNN dot com which is a means to me
your website gets 5.5 million uniques

68
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,279
week which again is a little bit more
than the Daily Kos but of course

69
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:52,950
much much much more and Boing Boing an
all-star forget the Daily Kos and going

70
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,069
buying those are worldwide

71
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:59,519
audiences Spurs you know CNN releases
their cities is it broken it's just us.

72
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,430
newsweek 3.2 USA Today 2.5 even
something like the New York Daily News

73
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,379
get seven and fifty thousand views per
issue

74
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,489
which is a hundred fifty thousand years
more per issue and the Daily Kos get

75
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,739
her entire week worldwide this is not to
like dismiss

76
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,970
I know some people in in the print
industry likes like kinda pretend

77
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,389
it's not happening box on happening
blocks to have a huge impact

78
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:25,470
now having a massive impact actually
mostly on

79
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,490
the mainstream media and when blogs to
have an impact

80
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,240
like the whole incident where you know
they found out that maybe those down

81
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,950
rather

82
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,080
and memos were being forged the method

83
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,680
how they really reach the masses was via
the mainstream media

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,380
and if you notice a lot of mainstream
media sites especially newspapers are

85
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,940
becoming more and more and more

86
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,940
like new media stuff if you saw me
around earlier today

87
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,490
you might see me drunk enough video
camera out well that's because when I

88
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,430
started working its past five years ago

89
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,680
all I really need it to be two
conferences a little nope

90
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,419
now gotta still camera not your recorder
for hi Cass economy

91
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,490
video camera so I can you blogs and this
makes going to places real pain in the

92
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,000
butt but

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,830
we have become more like the media and
in the same way very large media

94
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,568
tends to become a lot more like the
mainstream people become professionalize

95
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:14,210
people get paychecks people suffering

96
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,359
money is coming from so there's a kind
to continue between the two

97
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,560
am the key to really getting your
message across a journalist's

98
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,150
that's all so that's why you should talk
to them now you know what's the best way

99
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,740
to talk to them

100
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,720
is really think about what makes
professional journalists like myself

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,860
different from citizen journalists

102
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,539
or people who are writing academic and
books for people who are doing technical

103
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,599
literature

104
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,219
and and this goes back to understanding
of people think

105
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,400
this really if if the New York Times
wants to write about

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,210
supernova not really in some way should
almost be

107
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,770
a kind of a simplified version of a
professional academic talking about

108
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,539
supernova

109
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,389
integer some people have that idea and
that that if it's not done that way that

110
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:00,000
they're here

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
dumbing it down for simplifying
fast-rising signs are going from the

112
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,469
statement

113
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,590
when in fact you really need to
understand there radically different

114
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,949
creatures they have very different
objectives there very different names

115
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,479
and if you can understand that for stuff
you're getting only quite so much

116
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,128
when you read am the papers but also you
understand how to pitch

117
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,669
your am stories to them when it comes
time you want to put something in front

118
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,349
the mainstream media the big thing that
makes a difference was a citizen

119
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:26,830
journalist

120
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,159
academic journals is that their
livelihood my livelihood

121
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:33,139
depends on lots and lots of people
reading something they don't have to

122
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,120
read

123
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,389
I've written thousands of workers in my
lifetime but

124
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,159
not one single person has have to read
those for their job

125
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:44,520
this contrast would say for instance but
you might find in the journal

126
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,789
and where people you know if they're
involved profession they do have to keep

127
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:48,349
up

128
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:52,378
if you're in school you need three
detect kinda have to read that material

129
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,300
which is often why not material is you
often worthy but

130
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,590
things they have to carry they will
carry we can't afford to have material

131
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,580
that's really but I'll

132
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,330
Mac publications which you know go down
that route very rapidly

133
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,669
his readership because readers often say
we want substance we want

134
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,400
information we want some material we
want real hardcore stuff that we can

135
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,599
really sink your teeth into problem is
that a reader saying but actually it

136
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,039
turns out that

137
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,949
that those are the very rapidly those
our publications that gas

138
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,479
you put aside for further study at a
later point and never actually

139
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,030
get red and we're really interesting
stuff that gets red

140
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,060
so am I hate the word

141
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,719
you know some people try to say the
excuse terribly excessive me to say

142
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,300
well we're has to be entertaining the
use that reason that nobody

143
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,330
past three villagers puts out nobody
asked very very few people

144
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,909
have to read the NYTimes for their job
nobody has treatment publication the job

145
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,169
and I use that as an excuse to say what
we have to be entertaining

146
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,139
the truth is you don't have to be
entertaining and

147
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,039
that's an excuse but you do have to be
compelling compelling is the word which

148
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:00,520
means

149
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,389
when its reader comes to your
publication comes from Eric your

150
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,580
publication

151
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,990
they are given reasons to read that all
the way through to the end

152
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,379
otherwise what happens because a lot of
things going on in people's lives

153
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,460
to give you a few sentences them even
give you

154
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,819
paragraph or two paragraphs and then if
they don't really fueled in part to the

155
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:20,870
article to stop

156
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,219
or keep a great start and then you go
off into the garden weeds in the

157
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:27,629
salmon reading or becomes boring they
just stop

158
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,189
because they don't have to readers there
are many things that they might have to

159
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:32,289
refer profession

160
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,309
most mainstream journalists to is not
included in that group

161
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:41,030
so one of the best ways to make articles
compelling is to use a trick

162
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:45,209
an over real school trick and thats to
make articles into stories

163
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,320
and in fact is done so often that the
word story is often synonymous with Eric

164
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,490
I love story you see that story
newspaper but stories are very specific

165
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,880
typeof articles and stories very
specific relationship with

166
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,410
am reality stories have narratives
beginning

167
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,040
middle and an end is a dramatic
structure that when your brain sees it

168
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,959
in an article

169
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,670
you recognize that structure and knowing
is going to be you after beginning a

170
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,610
middle and an end

171
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,210
it pulls you through the article key to
keep you reading

172
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,490
they also have to be novel usually you
must miss a writing news

173
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,279
any concept that's fresh an interesting
so

174
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,639
here's the thing we're looking for those
children we're looking for us

175
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,540
we're looking for stories we go out into
the world to look for things to report

176
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,399
on

177
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,250
we're looking for that subset every hour
happens to fit

178
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,980
an hour structure which is not
everything

179
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,070
everything gets covered by academic
stuff and

180
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,240
technical issue and so on we r only
interested in that subset of things

181
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,209
which already 50 County made to fit into
an armed structure

182
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:52,690
and you know again we're not interested
in or even ready but all stuff

183
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,480
answers a lot of reality that just does
not cut from journalists

184
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,709
standpoint am so who did more than our
index

185
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:04,630
in arms can be character-driven a plot
driven am a profile for example is

186
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,320
mostly

187
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,050
targets bad person but even within a
profile you'll see

188
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,959
plot you see a dramatic are see the
purse challenge to overcome

189
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,110
something happens to them there's
something interesting

190
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,510
and as such you know some events are
relieved

191
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,880
into just a profile it's not just kind
of personality 30 harmonies for 10

192
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,939
you know kinda profile am

193
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,180
again a hard news stories mostly
partisan but even in

194
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,440
very hard news stories the best ones
will take the time to

195
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,149
sketch a couple characters to make you
care about yup there's a massive

196
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:38,630
three-alarm fire

197
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,050
you notice I going to find a coat found
in the lady on the corner of the block

198
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,070
which is what your house burned down

199
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,100
and that's because as hard news story
but you really need a character

200
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,579
to really make that story compelling

201
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:55,380
so unless a really well written we also
need to demonstrate balance now I've

202
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,100
picked up

203
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,720
you know Americans in your and I've read
you know

204
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,220
occasion time articles increase just
things are completely irrelevant to me

205
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,680
but there's relevant and their so
beautifully written you just keep read

206
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,430
them because

207
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,920
you just don't mind going down the
garden path the altar the cold hard

208
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,740
truth is

209
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,430
most of us are not good enough on a
daily basis to do that

210
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,420
and most the times are subject material
support so we really are looking for

211
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,290
things we can

212
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,349
where our readers 10 very very quickly

213
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,389
why am I reading this see have to give
them reasons for why the

214
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,810
why they're reading this article and
watching television read the next

215
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,889
article on

216
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,360
and paper reading a different
publication

217
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,019
so what does all that sort of you know
what journalists want to get the inverse

218
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,399
was a mean fewer packed basis

219
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,980
am means you're really gonna creature
coverage if you can help journalists

220
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,860
your story has these four things

221
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,940
characters clock things that actually
happened

222
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,230
the context the significance of the
event a novelty

223
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,500
the reasons is so important is not

224
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,510
all of us you know that so many things
going on in the world

225
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,860
and always have so many things to choose
from you know i cant you know

226
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,699
dozens and dozens presley's week some
people get hundreds

227
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:13,529
in a week and and you know why does your
story

228
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,589
deserve courage run up another story
again

229
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,610
you know they're significance in
intrinsic merit

230
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:25,389
I'm our partners am but also purposes
you other cool characters is their part

231
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,720
if you can you have to really show one
of these things to be considered for

232
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,079
at an attorney Scott look at you if
you've all four you're almost guaranteed

233
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,399
to get some kind of coverage less you
know it's completely chock-a-block

234
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,180
and you get pushed out because it has
been a massive terrorist attack on the

235
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,449
covers

236
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:45,040
but you release are gonna get journals
to pay attention to you can demonstrate

237
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,000
these

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,459
so hey do that well interesting
characters and is exactly why you feel a

239
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:52,930
special interest groups

240
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,410
see cats celebrities if you have a nice
big name and to put that nice

241
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,819
big-name into your press release that's
instantly interesting congratulations

242
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,570
you past the first heard and most mister
not fortunate to be able to light pole

243
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,100
big names you pics levees are Rockstar
CEO's you know

244
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,380
am so instead what you need

245
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,759
think about is and this is competition
for Presley's

246
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,860
but right one or two sons by as about

247
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,480
you if you're interested in your
journals into your story imagine if you

248
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,509
had to write

249
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:26,910
what's the most interesting thing about
you in one sentence

250
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,000
what would that be yours you think it
has to be relevant really doesn't matter

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,259
you're the world's best

252
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,730
you know matchstick modeler has to be
something that's apropos to

253
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,740
whatever it is you're getting be try to
get the journalist

254
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,250
interested in the first example here's
jane Joe's house Tech travels

255
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,220
she's back backpack to cross for cons
for laptop that's fantastic

256
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,350
and that's going to be very interesting
me to lead to any kind of a journalist

257
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,560
and also does everything and establishes
re:

258
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,230
and it says you know this is actually
someone who I can trust what they say

259
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,449
because a lot of people dawn summers

260
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:02,870
you know I want my I tried to get this
journalist listen to me and they didn't

261
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,320
isn't to be %uh they didn't you know wat
might get my words anyway to the just

262
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
ignored

263
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,550
because they didn't have a reason to
believe we hear lots of people talked

264
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,100
about the loss not just a

265
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,820
y de why are you the person who I'm
going to believe

266
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,630
and helps if you can establish what's
called in answer non-fiction

267
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,339
publishing trade a platform a reason to
credibility

268
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,319
the second there's a person is not as an
exciting as individuals Jane

269
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,160
but it says a lot of good things has
been open source object for ten years

270
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,149
and worked for several industry-leading
companies were found in his own star

271
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,610
and it's not dramatically exciting but
it does establish a great deal

272
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,899
authority and it says this person's on a
background disperse public

273
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:44,209
useful person to talk to

274
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,240
again Italian pasta explain what
happened

275
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,389
am you have to if you're talking about
making a presley's

276
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,639
you're talking about your China or you
know something terrible happened to you

277
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,050
and you've got

278
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,149
you kinda you've got explain Eve got to
connect the dots

279
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:02,279
you cannot you know do dot dot dot of
people oftentimes they're riding on line

280
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,740
or $20 clever funny

281
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,050
to make an implication and I'll say
something like you know

282
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,160
Carson you who's gone have problems
because I saw you know he was using you

283
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,740
know Microsoft Entourage

284
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,860
not now that may actually mean something

285
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,560
you guys but it will be absent nothing
features a journalist as a No

286
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,240
most the time to connect that little
insinuation that maybe

287
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,560
Mike some fun times not much wider
product you

288
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,120
and have to be explicit and you you
don't try to be clever just writings in

289
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,949
very simple straight

290
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:35,660
pros this happened that happen don't cry

291
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,149
avoid jargon like the plague if you do
have to bring in a word use it the way

292
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,160
to avoid jargon

293
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,610
is to write really about what something
danse not how it's implemented

294
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,910
to really think about you know one is is
technology

295
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,339
actually dues differences your receipt
back in the day talking with

296
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:54,680
personal computer you can use the phrase
PC you would see

297
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,589
home computer anybody can use you know
you try you anything but avoid using a

298
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,399
does that phrase PC because at that time
nobody knew PCs were

299
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:06,459
and they're good way to do all this
kinda stuff to explain yourself expand

300
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:07,170
your part

301
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,180
is just imagine that you're telling your
stories and bars nothing

302
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,600
your subject to think about how you
would simplify to cut it down to bond

303
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,769
with the people and people shouting you
know you're not really going to be able

304
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:17,129
to go into great detail

305
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:21,040
you gonna really simplify things down
and again always thinking concrete terms

306
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,250
about what every is think does don't

307
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,379
really worry too much better
implementation if you have a great new

308
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:28,490
encryption technique

309
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,519
really probably not wise to get in
depp's

310
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,629
how you did all this mathematical
competitions and stuff like this and

311
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:38,750
answers.com really want to focus on what
is

312
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,129
the point that's after was impact is
gonna happen privacy

313
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:46,750
or Chinese dissidents whenever
whatever's

314
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,149
and that goes into significance have to
explain the context of what's going on

315
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:54,180
and hear me talk a little bit and how
you do this research later

316
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,639
you really helps to understand what the
a journalist's

317
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,259
target audiences and the context what
you talkin

318
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,410
can shift depending on who you're
talking to you know and family were all

319
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,110
this can be called spin

320
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,810
am but it's actually really useful way
of getting your point across a specific

321
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:11,490
audience

322
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:15,709
so here we have the example that there's
a new technology new media technology

323
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,199
near me not violate the DNC I'm

324
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,550
if you were talking to me is a tech
journalist I probably would be

325
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,349
interested in the technology and how

326
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,669
bits and pieces working how this
happened but if you talk to see somebody

327
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,740
from the Wall Street Journal

328
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,250
popping up the first annual leadoff if
you want to meet a while

329
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,480
this technology is just come along a
really important because we think that

330
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,960
you know

331
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,430
people in America are not going to be
able to use this technology but

332
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,960
everything else is so maybe gonna

333
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,260
damage America's global competitiveness
am

334
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,230
if you were talking to main city
somebody from the Village Voice you

335
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,760
might say well we're concerned the DNC's
cialis

336
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,230
first amendment rights so you're looking
at the different impacts of your

337
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,970
technology

338
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,549
paulinho the fact that you're giving
them to the germans in a way

339
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:59,889
date can understand because some
journals for tech features

340
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,190
a geyser Main Street Journal's some
publications

341
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,250
you know someone guy covers everything

342
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,360
technology-related and probably actually
spends most of time covering help

343
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,520
conduct the kind

344
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,210
horrible fate that happens to a lot of
Science journalists and newspapers and

345
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,320
some on the incoming

346
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,809
we'll see how am for some like me we
have much more specialized beats

347
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,149
it's useful to find out the specific
person am

348
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,380
it's useful to know them have a much
more specific needs

349
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,130
I'm again novelty is a big thing what's
new what's difference

350
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,980
tell a journalist why this isn't yet
another black you're releasing a

351
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,520
software package

352
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,500
you know why you know suffer package is
very few saw for comes along that's

353
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,929
really revolutionary

354
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,720
very few was get to release the first
web browser very few was get released

355
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,110
the first page

356
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,950
so if you're releasing a piece of
software you really need to explain what

357
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,820
makes this different

358
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,950
what makes it not so much incremental
amounts over everything that's gone

359
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,049
before

360
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:00,840
and if you're releasing you know and and
you me nuts with the Firefox people did

361
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,139
very very well

362
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,870
the release a browser who cared browse
been around for years and a perfectly

363
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,190
functional missoni of browser on their
test of a ready

364
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,840
when the Mozilla people that are really
really really good job Firefox people

365
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,990
on explaining why their browser was
different and new

366
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,500
and worth talking about

367
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,360
so how to get a journals attention the
first place I'm

368
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,470
do not ball even bother sending your
email its palm

369
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,850
I mean I guess 20,000 these week most

370
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,440
fortunately percent you can see by my
spam filter am

371
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,380
it's just it's just dead Tony but don't
write sending colfax's

372
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,809
called emails colfax's you an email if
it's like an actual

373
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:45,190
letter may may work but just a
straight-out press release

374
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,320
is just jump and most because the rat
and I got my mailbox

375
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,950
with snail-mail I was looking a whole
bunch presley's what the ones I do pay

376
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,039
attention to is

377
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:57,230
and I can actual letter

378
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,020
that's addressed to me I mean that
happens

379
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,799
an actual proper stop book stamps I know
that's from you know that

380
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,879
Citibank memories me like an actual
letter is such a rare event

381
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,080
but I opening of excitedly and I sit
there and I beat

382
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,949
whole thing was most presley's a disc in
the first two lines in it seems to be an

383
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,830
immediate and

384
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,899
to study more pile which may or may not
ever gets

385
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,309
touched again two weeks later time
stunted trash

386
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:29,309
am I can actually letter I read only
through if it's actually dress

387
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:32,809
to me am I actually will pay attention
to

388
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,889
and great thing about about this
nanotechnology its persistent

389
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,409
it stays on people's desks am you can
get shuffled around so it

390
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:45,400
I suppose an email which is just one
line among thousand under a hundred

391
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,960
other emails on screen

392
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,730
and see if you're really trying to get a
pen intention turns attention

393
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,559
snowmen at its best well how do you know
you know who to write to

394
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,090
and his cuz person key is I you going
looking articles are written about your

395
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,090
general area

396
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,740
if you see an Arctic you like look at
the byline find out what that person is

397
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,230
my lead singer Joe Bloggs I saw your
article about block

398
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,990
I think you might also be interested in
block that's great also flattering

399
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,960
because you're listening really like me
they think I'm an expert in mister

400
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,640
you know in your view if you are getting
so close that person is def gonna read

401
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,240
all your stuff

402
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,789
that stage am another good way about
doing this as you look at the massive a

403
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:24,039
publication they often

404
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,400
or look online many publications have
very specifically what each journalist

405
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,000
us

406
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,539
now oftentimes are not in the very
obvious

407
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:35,779
areas the key office look in the media
kit area

408
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:39,360
you know for advertisers Tiger
advertisers many times they're they're

409
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,830
editorial breakdowns and who

410
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,889
what journals covers what coverage and
that's a good place to look

411
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,210
the person doesn't work in a publication
cities a freelancer that's great to

412
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,710
contact a freelancer

413
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,799
customer freelancer takes on your idea

414
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,010
a freelancer them pitch it to an end and
you can enter is much much more likely

415
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,929
to take idea from a freelancer

416
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:02,500
then just from you around presley's the
comes in over the transom

417
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,179
am so don't know contact the last it is
a writer you like

418
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,510
who writes to your area write them a
letter and then close your press release

419
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,929
am what's also useful than is beyond the
press release

420
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,330
is to have sex with you don't put this
between larry because again pasta

421
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,389
I see a big bulky package all the
freedom it

422
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,140
because I think it's gonna take time I
don't have time just can't get pic and

423
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,120
put in a pile

424
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,669
things to read later when I you're going
to get where the material

425
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:32,140
and sometimes of times and get to but is
always a really good idea to have a

426
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:32,730
press

427
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,390
can't am with extra resources me bigger
BIOS

428
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,710
about the organization timelines all I
kinda good stuff

429
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,960
am especially it's really great if you
can include

430
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,370
high quality high-res images notice I
said high-quality

431
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:51,120
and hi-res you know just because you got
nine megapixels is not mean you've got a

432
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,200
publishable

433
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,059
picture Miami cheaper these and just
because somebody knows how to work

434
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:59,330
all the menus on that doesn't mean
they're a good photographer

435
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,559
find someone who's a good photographer
make sure they're doing high resolution

436
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,309
photographs

437
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:06,928
and put them on the website people the
reason why you do this and you

438
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:10,340
you know it's always nice people for
media section your website has again jus

439
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,149
got fired

440
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,750
privilege to be in a special section of
themselves am

441
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,440
one of the reasons why that's so great

442
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,770
is because it is crunch time and and
enter has to choose between two stories

443
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,279
and one story house high resolution
imagery they can just drop it

444
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,640
their publication because you know you
clear the copyright you said at the

445
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,150
bottom

446
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,309
please these are photographs another
story

447
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:38,418
you know which might be just interesting
are sending photographer out

448
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:43,140
or paying for stock photography which
story do you think is gonna get

449
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,750
you know it's a huge oftentimes
logistics is a huge amount you want to

450
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,240
make is

451
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,750
easy in pain-free for them to cover you
as possible

452
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,130
so he talks meant mention press releases
earlier we're riding

453
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,279
presley's remember mom journals like
mine about

454
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,240
you up all these things you wanna say
something you know my son lamest

455
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,799
this is a cig break you have an is a
significant you know

456
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:09,190
job lower CO was a fascinating character
you have to back it up in a sentence or

457
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,059
two

458
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,389
after job was a passing cars because
he's being you know he's been he spoke

459
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,640
to Congress and Houston's comes

460
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,890
but see very explicitly use words like
this is new significant is a hot new

461
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,809
trend

462
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:25,590
this important because is a very
significant use those kinda keywords

463
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,570
because that's language to the
journalists gonna

464
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,418
look on for you want to we need to all
your stuff decode and try and work out

465
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:35,460
what's going on am so his examples for
example

466
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,840
really badly written presley's now you
want more than it solves the presley she

467
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,299
won

468
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:45,080
four point contact details but imagine
this is the first answer presley's like

469
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,899
time for foundation protesting the SEC's
decision actionable

470
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm are you sleep I'm

471
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,380
and also uses jargon it doesn't tell me
you know if this is just

472
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,649
now if I haven't we know that the FCC
decision I might pick up on it but

473
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:06,120
I'm unlikely to much better way right
now be

474
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,370
again see here have even mentioned
ultralight

475
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,659
technology have to use a jerk and I just
gone to focusing on

476
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:16,559
what technology doesn't impact soon
anyone could sleep in your email or

477
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,370
phone calls thanks for decision
yesterday the SEC

478
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,149
bans technology use protection is the
next generation wireless devices

479
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:27,490
these bands is an action word I use the
magic phrase next-generation

480
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,070
its novelty omelets all going forward

481
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,189
and finally go again more action the
time her foundation that exit is your

482
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,070
concern voiced their opinions

483
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,240
by launching an online petition not much
more dynamic its told the journalist

484
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,679
a lot more about it stole a journalist
the significance now probably the next

485
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,640
couple paragraphs in the press as you
would wanna

486
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,559
bring in the phrase onto my bad but
right now you told a journalist but

487
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:53,490
think its significance you've told about
what what's happening am

488
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,190
you know and you told another atoll
novel in you

489
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:02,480
don't forget four plays am you know me
more than just an email address

490
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,220
if you're serious about doing press you
really need to have like like look at

491
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,679
actual press releases the usually have
like a one-line

492
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,039
I am about anybody is mentioned in the
press release

493
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,210
they will have a little bit about the
organization that's ending at the press

494
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,510
release which is usually three or four
lines

495
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,179
you have contact details they will have
oftentimes the dedicated

496
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:24,230
email address am you know Press

497
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,190
blah blah blah which is a great thing to
do Anne also back to having a person

498
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,980
dedicated to my national

499
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,799
they also have the phone numbers I know
everybody loves email

500
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,960
fun mike is getting press release it
just has a phone number in

501
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,159
just has an email as a press contact
it's not

502
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,870
it's not great because many times on
deadline I wanna send an email

503
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,250
boy to get back many times I just be
lift the phone

504
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,620
and talk to somebody in consensus what's
going on immediately

505
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,669
it's really important tough number
journalist Mike

506
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:00,149
doing the column and reach out and touch
someone so you need a phone number you

507
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:00,649
need

508
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:03,870
if you do just happy male you need to be
sure you're going back to

509
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,320
any kind worries on that known during
the day within

510
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,330
also presley's as one page only the more
material

511
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,928
goes into your media kit

512
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:18,549
so so you have an event you got a march
you've got a press conference you got

513
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,750
something going on how to get rooms

514
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,899
their uncomfortable offices cubicles

515
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:28,120
our in treacherous place the Daystar it
burns down to where you going

516
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,840
great thing to do is primary simple
bribery

517
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,830
you know five choices to

518
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,240
Minister if I have a choice the two vans
to go to

519
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,350
and one is saying well we will supply
you know Christmas

520
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,350
you wine and cheese and your man isn't

521
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,159
you know which 1i gotta go to if I think
the two are pretty much equal news

522
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,809
I'm gonna go to wine and cheese because
you know you don't have that much in the

523
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,879
free food and free booze is great

524
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,640
am if you're having a larger event to
you she really good idea to also let the

525
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,330
girls know

526
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,809
will be special area set aside for them
and we also want to think about which

527
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:06,879
which could be anything too simple for
making sure their reserve seats at the

528
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,570
front

529
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,740
have an audience now sometimes people
get annoyed get to just come and sit

530
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,309
down pon surround on the go out

531
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:17,760
well because think of them as
representing thousand houses

532
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,850
houses on the people am yeah non

533
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:24,539
you know a little bit a privileged goes
a long way especially area can be

534
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,539
something just as simple as a quiet area

535
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:31,460
when they can do interviews and plug in
your laptop strictures

536
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,230
when your time invite entrance to event
make sure you can say this run-up you

537
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,990
actually read the paragraph page

538
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:40,549
you notes on soul will be available for
interview am

539
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:44,620
9 you and I injury shodi one-on-one
opportunities were depressed only

540
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,519
conference

541
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,610
if you have a massive stroma people

542
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,130
I'm just coming up for doing it and
that's hard for the journalist asked

543
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,620
questions that's going to be less
appealing from the now they might take a

544
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,649
risk and soon to be able to ask
questions

545
00:28:56,649 --> 00:28:59,880
but it's much more appealing if they
know they're going to be able to ask

546
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,419
questions and get answers because that's
what makes their reporting

547
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,559
reporting you know being an eyewitness
things is

548
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,129
it's great what's really important is
the ability to be able to come ask

549
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,950
questions and specific questions they
can say even if the huge

550
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,740
and you know i i cover space walk to
nasa press conferences down to the

551
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,610
köppen

552
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,279
these people show charging Andries
michael shatman charge because

553
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,539
you know I could right ever an article

554
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:29,210
just a serious questions and answers
into space the public statements

555
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:33,230
bont would look like everybody else's
are because there's nothing you

556
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,330
the magic thing for me is people say you
know what makes my readers interested in

557
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm icons the an answer to a question
from IEEE Spectrum

558
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,630
massa replied: some really interested in
having that one on one touch because it

559
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,409
makes

560
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,070
my morning different from everybody
else's reporting

561
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,470
and also you know make sure people are
happy with with that kind of stuff me

562
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,190
sometimes you come to fancy people are
not really interesting talking

563
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,850
Press you gotta make sure the STR when
they are willing to talk to people and

564
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,710
that takes time out of their day

565
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,850
well thats that's going to you know you
gotta working out negotiate with them so

566
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:05,940
not snarky

567
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,039
and me

568
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,769
am giving interviews

569
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,049
when the most important things I would
say but infuses don't give them am

570
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:19,100
I mean to that is don't give them right
off the cuff

571
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,299
if you're you know exhibiting repressive
and are you

572
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:25,710
nurse things that you realistically Shin
prepared for and thought about things in

573
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,330
advance

574
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:30,189
yes do entries off-the-cuff very
experienced yes to interviews of the cop

575
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,210
gender speaking never do an interview of
the cops if you get a phone call

576
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,390
and someone says hi I'm from our
magazine I you've got something going on

577
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:37,980
Monday

578
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,600
you don't mind a massive few questions
best thing to do in that case

579
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,880
is to say well I'm really just of time
austin is one thing can give you a call

580
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,600
back in ten minutes

581
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,110
now doctors two things one you probably
will get you the germans phone number

582
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,820
which can be useful later on if they're
not to your caller someone

583
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,019
to it also gives you just 5-10 minutes

584
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:02,059
where you can just not be flustered and
pull yourself together

585
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:05,260
and think find out what kinda things
might wanna say

586
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,600
really only going to get 12 points
across in any interview what are those

587
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,210
points wanna see what things

588
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,519
don't you wanna say if you're doing it a
telephone interview right

589
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,620
those things down so you have in front
of you

590
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,460
we're in the heat of the moment you know
you can just you can just end up saying

591
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,110
of on

592
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:26,539
things later on you i'd asking for the
menopause is a really great man up doing

593
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:27,669
that

594
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:31,350
also when you're prepared thinking about
you thinking about where you wanna say

595
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,070
is

596
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,250
you know in an initial contact the
journalists you wanna find out

597
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,390
you know who they're working for finite
featureless have the genders

598
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,460
because this is gonna tell you what
level you're gonna pitch

599
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,100
you guys gonna tell you all those are
things we talked about earlier what

600
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,190
kinda contacts

601
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,539
context is a journalist interested in
and what

602
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,629
you know what is relevant to their
audience and those the kind things

603
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:52,919
you're going to say

604
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,679
you're going to think about what you're
not going to say you're not going to go

605
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,610
through the same

606
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,519
spiel for every single journalist you're
going to have to 10

607
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,789
if you do that you actually get much
better much better results am

608
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:07,690
don't suggest email interview it's
awfully like aluminum interactivity to

609
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,289
be able to talk to the car

610
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:14,779
because you know half what we do is

611
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:17,850
like %ah people effort at story and i'm
looking for. inches how

612
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,960
1 I'm interested in is technical I want
to be educated

613
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,149
I want to know something works wanna
know how this happened I one who said

614
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:25,399
what to whom

615
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:29,639
you know half it is is that I'm actually
again because I'm interested narrative

616
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:33,529
I'm interested in what you thought I'm
interested what you felt

617
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:37,210
because that goes into articles and i
can really pick up an article

618
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,690
am so you know again a II cover space so
I won't just

619
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:45,490
I'm talking with would say you know guys
running something on mars

620
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,789
I'm not just gonna talk about the very
dry technical details of

621
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:52,789
you know what rocks you can analyze and
and ask him how did you feel

622
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:55,950
when it landed you know these things are
very difficult to

623
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,100
email kind of situation and they may
conduct think so we

624
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,769
don't don't do in email interviews you
say yeah I want to give me a call

625
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:05,980
talked on the phone don't set your
conditions for interviews

626
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,149
you know well you can send this way I
mean Richard Stallman can get away with

627
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,830
this

628
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:14,330
almost I mean maybe am you know where he
has

629
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:17,399
no I never interviewed him but reputedly
the awful set

630
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,750
condition see you after for Terminix is
good news annex you know

631
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,929
with his biographer I think I notice
that he demanded that there be certain

632
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:27,429
copyright you know considerations and so
on am

633
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:31,159
he might be able to get away with that
because 10 you probably will not

634
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,690
you start sending your conditions on an
email on an interview people just gonna

635
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,510
go you're not worth the bother

636
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:40,370
I am also be incredibly tall are too
stupid stupid questions

637
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,799
doesn't mean the journalist you could
just means I have to ask them for the

638
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,840
sake

639
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,059
are of an interview so for instance you
know

640
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,190
I've been doing this a few years so I
haven't rough idea how to compile works

641
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,639
I may not be a man right one

642
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:55,370
by understand you know source code and
compile

643
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,580
object your I understand that but if I'm
talking to an open source project on

644
00:33:59,580 --> 00:33:59,980
this thing

645
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,059
are often ask so you know source code
what's that all about

646
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:07,408
because I wanna put a quote in the
journal and in the article from you that

647
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:10,990
explains what's worst critics I need to
explain to my readers who are not going

648
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,750
now

649
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,780
necessarily you know what's going on so
even if you ask you because it doesn't

650
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,149
mean they're stupid

651
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:20,319
is often a reason for them a course in a
car did you get from this journalist

652
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,540
again you're not really gonna make 70
points if you

653
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,659
you know treat the person stupid may
just be not very much

654
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:31,909
is so again dues for interview speak
slowly and clearly tell your answers

655
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,030
and keep notes always right and if you
can you also might want to consider

656
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:38,649
you know if you're going to do a lot of
public relations you have you been given

657
00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:39,638
you know you're in a

658
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,340
press guy graduations are going to me
outreach and buying something like this

659
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,510
am this is from Radio Shack Picasa few
dollars

660
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,030
in this is the locks an verses please
enter phone in this and

661
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:54,580
into my am recorder is even cheaper
version which actually works even more

662
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,470
phones which is just like in induction
while pick up the slack on your phone

663
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,510
and them record away always assume that
you are being reported

664
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,550
state laws very as I think those keep
equity refinance

665
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,770
but certainly in New York State only one
person has to be read the full cost in

666
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,870
conversation is

667
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,490
be recorded and so I report pretty much
all my interviews

668
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,710
uniformly and to just assume you're
being being recorded

669
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,580
again XP things happens work in the
concrete terms sometimes people again

670
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,600
you know technical people get very
annoyed

671
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,009
I think their pets it's it's it's doing
horrible things I'm

672
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,730
to simplify something they want to
explain all the nuances and all the

673
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,860
great years everything

674
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,090
to set the record straight in to make
sure everything is understood

675
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,130
and I think you're going to control what
their peers if they're seen as doing

676
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,860
this

677
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,810
campus on actual crime iraq's after its
just wanna be actress

678
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,240
you really don't need to revamp
precision so for those view of a

679
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,140
tactical benso precision France's

680
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,120
and and a number is the number of you no
significant figures after the death

681
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,630
point so know if I was looking for the
value hi

682
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:03,350
2.98 4-7 6-4 7-5 is very precise cannot
free actress

683
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:07,120
you're much better off to same applies
around three you know it's not free for

684
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,259
science but its

685
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,870
much more much more accurate you want to
give accurate

686
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,470
don't worry precision don't worry about
details simplified

687
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,420
say well that's kinda what works by
encrypting actually no one in the hot

688
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,550
incredible massive things are happening
but just right very very simple

689
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,200
again what does it do and a great thing
to do is not the N is suggesting is

690
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,580
other people the journalists to talk to
so you're again promoting your mean

691
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,140
you know people love the kind you know
we're gonna say things in your world

692
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,950
view

693
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,100
and the juice go looking for this
because it increases and resources

694
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,490
and they're gonna think very very
favorably later on because you've been

695
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,060
very

696
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,029
hopeful to them so next time they have a
tech question that particular technology

697
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,670
they're much more likely to richest
bring you up at the blue and say hey

698
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,890
when you think about this is very
helpful or do you know of any other

699
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,000
people you talk to

700
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,210
and it increases the number of chances
you have in the future

701
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,590
I love you know having a relationship
with a journalist

702
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:05,630
don't don't talk anymore noisy don't use
speakerphone never confirmed people are

703
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,090
part interviews I sometimes forget this
would like to know

704
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:12,150
when their PR people involved our ring
up the guy and go well there are mister

705
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,310
so-and-so

706
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,130
you know they're all these terrible
rumors and that your product is unsafe

707
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:22,100
your product safe an answer as well
sheesh

708
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:26,180
yes it's perfectly safe you know years
not being highly credible their

709
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,200
don't just just you it's a journalist
and don't often

710
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,650
hands and when i cough to review
everything rats which is where one

711
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,440
little thing you try explain suddenly
becomes as massive increasing

712
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,300
year-on-year

713
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,260
you know worldview about how you know
corporate america is bad and how carbon

714
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,030
everything is bad dinner

715
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,550
polluting and a global warming and every
you don't need to explain your entire

716
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,190
worldview

717
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,420
in an interview just you little segments
actualmente

718
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,250
to what's going on never gets nope don't
swear you know if you can really but it

719
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,420
looks terrible imprint it's okay to be
excited

720
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,360
but ok you know and to town and shouting
at people you don't insult people

721
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,020
because again next term in print you
know and don't say things about people

722
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,850
you don't

723
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:10,620
no organizations you don't know for
instance you know Bill Gates

724
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,370
I miss you personally met Bill Gates
don't go around calling night he said

725
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:18,310
biggest jerk ever you in their menu
might be very nice person individually

726
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:22,350
but if you've got the kind of thing that
propagates whole lotta context

727
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,620
and looks can look just terrible imprint
depending on how it happens

728
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,490
good rule of thumb to me is issue that
everything you say magic

729
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:32,650
everything you've ever said in that
interview was gone and print would you

730
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,210
really want

731
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,290
every single word to be imprint me nuts
that's the way you should think about it

732
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:40,830
rally in a talk by the later is that
maybe 10 words

733
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,890
years ago print you don't want them to
be bad to be

734
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,600
your words and your preferred on again
don't insult the journalism is sometimes

735
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,779
I talk to people in people are again

736
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,360
she's media and you know life too

737
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,710
you know the getting laid am it just
gets password

738
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,710
I was using on a good idea to get
usually I'm

739
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,560
again and don't get annoyed at you if
you say you say well you know I think

740
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,220
such incidents happened I was there man
I can tell you

741
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,560
well you know don't be so be surprised
acid backing up special documents and if

742
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,580
you have

743
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,810
documents to back up what you're saying
maybe maybe it's the simplest a white

744
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,570
paper

745
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,880
or maybe you do have photographed maybe
you've got some

746
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,950
document that you somewhere that backs
up what youre saying

747
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,950
offer that to the germans because
documentation is actually have a good

748
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,990
a good journalist is like gold coin
because

749
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,510
I'm miss reports can be he said she said

750
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,600
but documentation 30 documentation that
is just great stuff that the stuff they

751
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,890
can go to the bank on

752
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,150
if you have documentation offer to them
if

753
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,390
they ask you for documentation don't get
upset that they're not you know take

754
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,920
your word for it because

755
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,490
you don't want the journal is to just
takes you know sources work for things

756
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,710
you want used to be a little skeptical
love you

757
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,080
you know when you read the paper you get
annoyed got home I the just

758
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,620
my ass is kinda hard questions how they
just reprinting this guy just take

759
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:02,210
you know the same sounds can reply to
you

760
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,970
so your dollar stuff you manage to you
know de journalists interview you've

761
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,910
done again into you think is really well

762
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,960
am what can you expect I'm

763
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,180
your objective your expectations that
you're going to educate inform the

764
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,089
journalist

765
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,700
am you know

766
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:24,790
say a feature article which is three
thousand words mom I might interview

767
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,350
15-20 people some beer was even more
maybe half it does actually

768
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,720
print just because you didn't get quote
in print doesn't mean

769
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,090
that you where who was a waste of time

770
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,440
because you probably have helped inform
all the other stuff wage-earners

771
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,760
RightFax in their own voice

772
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,460
where you think this fax came from the
fax came home because somebody told them

773
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:51,200
what was going on am and do some people
get very my the talk to me for 20

774
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,720
minutes

775
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,760
for half an hour and then you know the
began

776
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,670
no sentence because I have
responsibility my readers to only given

777
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,850
the important to you

778
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:03,250
actually three minutes 23 minutes is
about marriage that that's not a lengthy

779
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,560
interview some people think that's
incredible nappy time

780
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,759
it's really it's really not an average
mister

781
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,650
and really Anna is probably going to be
there 1020 words that are really sure

782
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,580
and pointed and again are going to be
interesting to rear

783
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,110
I'm also stressed that spike on the time
if you don't hear anything that's going

784
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,140
on

785
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,150
no don't bring up buddy journalist and a
man doesn't disappear to why is this our

786
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,660
winning ways on this time

787
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,170
notes on the journal's control many
times when an asterisk in spite

788
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,530
you're being annoying is not going to
make the story appear

789
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,480
if it's not gonna Pierre decision has
been made what you can do is sometimes

790
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,330
you can say

791
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,850
you can if you can let them know if
something is timely or something is

792
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,190
going to change

793
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,940
and not mine you know bring something
for it am

794
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,930
but that's really a fan of honey call
you can do this is no point in putting

795
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,759
the journalist because

796
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,480
you know either story peers for it
doesn't you're not going to influence

797
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,710
that decision

798
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,570
by I'm bugging the journalist

799
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,660
and again and also at the energy you can
expect that your articles gonna have a

800
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:08,250
key point if you talk to guy for now he
seemed incredibly sympathetic a nice on

801
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,610
the phone

802
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,610
well you know that's what we all try to
be nice and synthetic on the phone and

803
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,630
the article comes out it's like

804
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,610
you know the conclusion is completely
180 degrees your position

805
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:22,000
well don't be surprised by that to
journalists are not your friends

806
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,760
but you know we're gonna sound of a law
like that in many ways on the phone

807
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,640
because we want to have a normal
conversation we want to draw you out and

808
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,290
so what

809
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:32,440
but we're reserving judgment remember to
not to everybody

810
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,040
am you want rules to be more skeptical
Anna

811
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,040
an able to step back from a pleasant
conversation

812
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,500
and be able to make smart decisions and
skeptical decisions about

813
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,510
am what you can expect is that if you're
quoting the article

814
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,380
to be fairly represented if the article
comes out in the conclusions not blame

815
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,130
on it

816
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,170
before you get completely man five
handler

817
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,170
did you get yours too sensitive was your
you know

818
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,260
measures side included was a fairly
represented and if it was a sometimes

819
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,910
all you can

820
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,500
you can ask for if however things do go

821
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,890
wrong you know somebody said somebody
contacted you and you told them

822
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:13,150
absolutely not that never happened that
way and yet the article comes out

823
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,220
you know things happened a particular
way where your quote chart and how to

824
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,110
contact thanks to destroy it

825
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,330
your first to appear and you know it's
repeating theme

826
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,710
as you go down to the slide is right a
polite letter

827
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,090
to journalists saying well you know Hey
Joe me a nice conversation I was a

828
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:29,470
little surprised

829
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:33,490
by the final output II really I know my
notes show that we we we talked about

830
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,820
this when

831
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,390
concerned about this so first letter is
very kinder gentler

832
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,690
mean maybe was an honest mistake but if
you're aggressive

833
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,490
they'll get defensive may use on mistake
and I'll get corrected

834
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,620
if the journal's kinda blows you off is
not paying attention to next up is right

835
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,350
whole life letter to the editor hey you
know i tryin

836
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:54,580
talk that haven't heard back from him
and we have this problem

837
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,620
I can back it up and oh by the way this
stage you know

838
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,410
you know if you want I have recording of
the conversation by the way

839
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,279
you know so you're you're backing up
your search if that doesn't work then

840
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,630
you go on to the publisher

841
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,140
and you can ride after at some point
though it's often just it's not worth

842
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:09,870
pursuing

843
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,670
pass from point because actions no real
legal obligation

844
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,870
on them to print a corrections someone
you really are if you're looking for a

845
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,400
correction you really are

846
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,940
time ask them to do it going to the
heart because they want to maintain

847
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,440
their reputations

848
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,500
as a reputable news organization someone
but you know unless they have

849
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,770
done something illegal me on a slander
did live love you

850
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,790
you know you don't have a huge and legal
redressing not compelled

851
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,560
so you catch more flies with honey than
vinegar something has gone wrong

852
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,940
am I think that's about it so

853
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,170
any questions sales is a handout phone
in summer test

854
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,760
most these points am some rest

855
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,930
any questions P to come to the my kids
cuz statements

856
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,060
say you have to cut my 0

857
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,370
I have to turn just before we start
though I have to

858
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,549
I hope much like back issues that you
guys might be interested in here and I

859
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:02,240
have to

860
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,770
very exciting just fresh from now and
Brodeur

861

am hats so am who can tell me what IEEE

862
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:15,670
1003 is the standard for

863
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:18,810
John on his laptop harder for do no

864
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,830
thats 1394 POSIX

865
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:27,319
yes agreement

866
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,440
okay and and maybe not an easy one

867
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,750
80 2.3

868
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,230
hearted 11 80 2.3

869
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,350
Ethernet yes

870
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:47,640
okay sorry there was a question as a
given up for no

871
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,900
have a question so much as just a a
couple comments from

872
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,430
that's okay sure nevermind the slide
here

873
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:57,700
run all these people

874
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,990
II would you say as a journalist you

875
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:05,970
the the comment about the food cannot be
taken too lightly

876
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,200
yeah seriously

877
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,670
journalists work art country and

878
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,680
if you give them food as opposed to not
there's a

879
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,009
much better chance that your member
member said there's like four things you

880
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,400
have to have novelty & special
characters

881
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,750
actually many times all you need is
whose and food

882
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,730
and that's and that should be enough
he's not lying yes

883
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:34,840
I mean yeah versus yeah as the staff
photographer for my school's newspaper

884
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,720
I can attest that there's a reason why
we've known for having food your office

885
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,290
newsman Mike through yes yeah it's
disturbing the

886
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,360
yeah you can argue with the arm one
other things

887
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:51,820
hand is offering a little advice here
and there is a

888
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,040
if you're going to pitch reporter on a
story

889
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,320
and they have been solicited your input
on it

890
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,320
if you're just blind pitching story

891
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,870
really good ideas to do a a little bit a
research on the reporter

892
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,040
to find out what they've read about with
their

893
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,340
expertise is and most importantly
whether or not they've covered

894
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,870
the subject that you're pitching because

895
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,220
you will not solve them and they will
never talk to you again

896
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,660
if you try to pitch in with something
they broke or something

897
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,970
%uh that they've written extensively
about yeah you approach them like they

898
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:27,950
don't know anything about the

899
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:32,680
the issue the other thing II guess I
will just take a little bit have

900
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,759
contention with Lee said in that is it
the again it's an opportunity thing

901
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,320
if you have the opportunity I you have
an exclusive you're offering the

902
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,170
journalist something

903
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:45,430
the is up %uh hi news value

904
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:48,720
is really good idea to set the terms
I've love

905
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,520
the and I kept saying this because as i
decisiveness and I i actually

906
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,390
don't wanna do that I know you're you're
you're actually right I think I think

907
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:57,600
maybe and

908
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,530
I think I said we're don't set beard
conditions yeah but but actually begins

909
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:02,890
okay to set the terms

910
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:06,400
up an interview I actually it's okay to
say I can give you half an hour or I can

911
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:06,860
say

912
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,130
I can really talk about this but I can't
really address

913
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:14,340
such and such as or if you want to use a
quota mine ask if you just read it back

914
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,300
to me oh yeah I mean actually

915
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,700
which which goes into service or serve
you which we didn't which I did talk

916
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,990
about but as as in

917
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:24,470
a law science journalists am will to
source a view which means you get back

918
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,650
on their

919
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:29,510
just a quota maybe chunk of the article
that's a great opportunity to just

920
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:33,410
you know make sure everything is OK it's
not she's rewrite history

921
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,850
but but many the matisse we're seeing
you can say you know I would really

922
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,830
appreciate C Mike Mike my comments and

923
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:43,110
on if you are if you if it's you know
some the main

924
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:46,400
some didn't general guys will balk at
this but actually most most guys would

925
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:46,970
probably do it

926
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:50,350
that's a fair request it is turn it is
actually very clear it I the central air

927
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:51,150
conditioning is

928
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:55,090
do you save yourself a lot as like oh
that's not what I said

929
00:48:55,090 --> 00:49:00,340
yeah and in you have fewer I had a bad
experience with journalists

930
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:03,450
explains and the only if the couple
things have to say

931
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,460
if you're if you're speaking a topic
that you know a lot about and you

932
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,460
venture into an area

933
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,620
don't know a lot about don't say more
than you know

934
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,680
any when then in that applies to not
just areas knowledge but areas

935
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,310
love home there is a

936
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:23,090
love whatever whether the incidental or
jewel yes

937
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:26,930
what's going on and then the last thing
I would say is um

938
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:30,120
back up 2.2 percent I would say I'm

939
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,720
I probably spend it's about

940
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:37,950
only about 40 percent stories that I
actually spend a lot of time on actually

941
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,630
make it into press yeah

942
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,140
and just because somebody spent a lot of
time with you on the phone

943
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,250
is no guarantee that they had a you know
make out with you have that

944
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,150
enough hiciste yeah I know that's
granite and diplomats your screens to

945
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,340
determine if you search for my name to
Google

946
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,750
you could probably fill find you know
somebody from the serbians karen

947
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,920
Matthews in New York

948

who is very very grieved and I have
talked to him

949
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,840
and then is he didn't get fear and print
was in fact has kinda

950
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,100

now %um feel army

954
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:22,290
yeah hmm so I'm not sure how often this
happens

955
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:25,400
but fortitude do issue

956
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,770
do the journalists to has decided

957
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,360
did marshes actually going to spend
something against you

958
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,370
again it's a manner as well you know you
always have the option

959
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:41,359
not to talk to journalist I mean nothing
if you if you are like looking

960
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,350
when the journal's first contacts you in
New in you again it was a good 82

961
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,710
researchers limit if you see call centre

don't like you more than

963
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:56,160
make excuses on top of that particular
journals if you've already talked to

964
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,580
them and they seem to be really

965
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:01,270
distorting what you've said again that's
where it's really useful to have taken

966
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,150
notes

967
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,440
curing during an interview you've done
ninety record

968
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,880

their superiors and said look they said

969

X wines and if you listen to the phone
conversation it's clearly contact

970
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,290
yeah even if you don't have a recording
and you know it's just have no it's me.

971
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,340
contempory notes written down

973
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,520
letter to the editor is you know
something like that enters what will

974
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,610
take seriously any

and you know people yes you know what
the Camry and

989
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,110
you know problem is most journalists
don't know how to use encryption

990
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,290
I mean and this and this is not
necessarily hand

you know who journalist talk to in this
we've seen this in recent

997
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,210
issues just the mere fact that a
journalist talk to somebody

998
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:56,670
am can be enough you don't even need to
know any the content of the conversation

999
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:00,680
but just knowing that contact was made
between person a journalist

1000
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,810
can often be more than enough to get
people into deep deep deep trouble

1001
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:08,610
and welfare but it these reasonable
doubt I
