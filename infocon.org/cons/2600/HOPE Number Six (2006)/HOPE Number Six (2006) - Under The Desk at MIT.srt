1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:05,879
and it's called under the desk at MIT
thanks for coming to talk appreciated

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,950
my talk is going to be about is a new
group on trying to form called the

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,639
public domain saw for foundation

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,379
and basically with the stock is going to
be about is it is going to be about

5
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:20,300
avoiding the whole our world up
licensing in legal matters in just

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,100
checking the coding getting actually
program instead of %uh

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,280
happen if I am sure lawyer cell %ah
something I'm a tragedy for years

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,440
but a I'm actually try and commit other
people to go and do too long with me

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,940
peña reason my talk is called under the
desk at MIT is that I

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,449
I recently snuck in the back door of MIT
in heaven kick me out yet

11
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,500
and a when you do get MIT you have this
this kind of nagging me question of our

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,980
what am I gonna do while I'm here

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,579
and so I kinda grew up on free software

14
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:54,340
Hama I'm littler than i lookin my first
program was actually written

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,050
%ah aside from your basic and things
like that in elementary school

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,450
without GCC in the 1980s so I'm a huge
fan above Richard Stallman

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,700
and a are a master wasn't for him I
wouldn't really be able to even a

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,040
the program I don't think I never would
be able to get access to the the

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,400
compilers and year 10

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,659
you back then a a BASIC compiler cost
you know over a thousand dollars which

21
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,659
in today's dollars this is by close to
three to five thousand dollars

22
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,440
so when richard was developing the first
versions %uh

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,120
the genius of where he was at the AI lab
at MIT

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,180
and a to a number times when he slept
under his death actually running gdb in

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,920
GCC in any other tools

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,049
I was mostly a one-man effort when it
first came out cell

27
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:39,840
I like to take a moment for you can
start to distract nice is amazing

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,229
contribution and thank him for

29
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,070
because I don't think any of us for the
most part would be here today without

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,460
him

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,430
um I like you really bad history

32
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,220
little bit more than I really happen
next did

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,770
what really started everything was the
commercialization MIT and I'm

34
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,000
and if you're here for the keynote
opening address got 'em better history

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,950
this from from our mess and I'm gonna
give you embrace wanna briefly kinda

36
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,369
coverage because I'm a really back to it
through my cock

37
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:10,109
I'm you basically what we had it the
island in the nineteen seventies

38
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:13,389
was a situation where software wasn't
really considered intellectual property

39
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:13,859
at all

40
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,999
it wasn't something that was license or
copyright it which is basically

41
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:20,799
like mathematics it was something that
was discovered in made available and

42
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:21,129
then

43
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,540
you know basically committed to paper
tape or two

44
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,078
Union um number of other mediums over
the years as the commercialization had

45
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,370
meth lab

46
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,540
and we started have competing interests
between

47
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,760
commercial software and this idea that
no

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,578
suffer was really something you get home
was national property um

49
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,669
that an iPad a schism

50
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,340
and wee bit it was basically a
separation to the two camps wanna

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,980
pleaded

52
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,569
suffers property you something was
invested in developing the other believe

53
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:50,870
that

54
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,430
yourself or something that couldn't
beyond should be shared freely available

55
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,159
um fairly common in the nuts managing
your project

56
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,989
and its beginnings in 1983 and 84 with
like I said

57
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,349
international GCC engine you on GTB

58
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:09,469
debugger and so forth all the tools that
are associated with that

59
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,959
and what eventually became the gene you
personal shopping system

60
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,449
the GPL really took the lead in the
early years thanks mostly to Richard the

61
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,859
fact that he was one leading

62
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:22,959
the community um over the years though

63
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,150
as is more people began to gain exposure
to computers answer to rate %uh for

64
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,839
themselves

65
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:31,209
they found had different competing
interests compared to what Richard had

66
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:32,699
just basically sharing things they had

67
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,709
you granting you to find they had
companies who want to start and so forth

68
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:36,989
in

69
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,339
differ University said different
cultures and MIT and report also

70
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:42,180
producing really great software

71
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,480
we found was the BSD license came onto
the scene

72
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,040
and and that was the next really large
license that couple lot

73
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,478
what was available in terms of the
actual source code the number apply to

74
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,290
code available

75
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,040
if you would actually go back and look
good number lines and the BSD License

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,929
GNU GPL

77
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,609
you would see the BSD license car very
quickly to the GPL

78
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,819
eventually came close to surpassing um

79
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:11,349
as time went on it was basically you
know two or three licenses mainly

80
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,260
GPL BST and Mikey had a license for a
while that was pretty popular

81
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,180
but eventually kinda faded out and was
replaced by

82
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,660
ppl BST commercial interests eventually
entered

83
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,820
the the subject aryan the world to
software in

84
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,849
that can happen during the dot-com from

85
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,830
when a lot a company saw that they could
do very quick in low-cost start-up

86
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,740
by having suffering costs reduced by
using

87
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,360
you open the email Suffern fun the open
source movement founder from them

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,700
know Eric Raymond and so forth actually
trying to get companies is your source

89
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,620
who sued

90
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,020
things could crest faster in general now

91
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,150
this led to a number problems you must
be super licence proliferation

92
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,390
I'm and that's something I'm gonna try
and address in stock and hopefully

93
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,039
something that the public domain suffer
finish in contrast

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
so what's next for for the community to
suffer developer such as people were

95
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,530
developing free suffer

96
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,010
and who are working in this area in in
hopefully

97
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,550
there's gonna be able to make a point to
that now

98
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,800
the two groups are really oppose is I
said and this goes all the way back to

99
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,050
the days on the island

100
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,660
is the people who don't use of for
necessarily as property

101
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,460
and who viewed as something that should
be pretty sure to be a war that anyone

102
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,270
should have access to be able to study

103
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,979
make and can call them the freedom
camping in the control camp which would

104
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,780
be

105
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,650
you the businesses that are trying to
make money developer commercial

106
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,290
ecosystem around suffer development
computers

107
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,260
now the freemen group is richer for not
doing his I'm

108
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,390
his keynote address in through many
documents on the Free Software

109
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,400
Foundation website in licenses

110
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,190
visitors for primary freedoms our utmost
importance to freedom 0 the freemen won

111
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,700
the code for in one study the code for
him to be sure who did freedom three to

112
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,340
improve the code

113
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,000
the control group IV says different
wrists know their primary concerns

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,060
investment recruitment

115
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,560
they pay number programmers to develop
software and the need to make sure that

116
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,310
they can pay the salary in actually

117
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,440
get a return on investment ROI we paid
investors continue their business model

118
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,620
other interested in protecting trade
secret rather than actually like people

119
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,790
to study the code

120
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,800
and they're interested in competitive
advantages over the competitors friends

121
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,810
during the coup

122
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,420
and likewise a particular you pretty
bloody a maintenance cost

123
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,860
has a much greater com concern to them
and the ability to love people to

124
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,300
improve the code her what kinda benefits
as boomers could yield

125
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,520
so when are you trying to mediate the
situation begin with people who are in

126
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,120
conflicting views I think the most
important thing to do is look for common

127
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,560
ground

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
so what kinda common ground to be fine
between these two camps

129
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,970
up I think everyone wants a truce offer
quality you know everyone hates bison

130
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,810
and the process and biking is always
very painful one and time-consuming

131
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,900
improve software efficiency no suffer
the cost less to make an suffer the

132
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,500
costliest

133
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,750
development and share I am Lacombe
difficulty in training

134
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,910
and educational people you want to use
you shop for her you want we'll develop

135
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,340
with your programming languages your
API's

136
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,000
a reduced investment basic computing
every business would like to have a free

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,190
people packets they don't have to take
that offer

138
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,650
other overhead are their bottom line um

139
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,190
in into their piloted on her disease are
the most important to me personally is

140
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,130
his rapid technological progress in
rapid scientific

141
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,950
no progress soap what software
development models were gonna support

142
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,590
these common commonalities the past um

143
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,700
and what exactly is the public domain
and how can you play into this well

144
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,889
the public domain is basically no rights
reserved when you play something in the

145
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:30,610
public domain

146
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,720
basically putting it out there without
any copyright on it without any claim

147
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,690
ownership

148
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,880
there's no legal restrictions on use at
all on

149
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,090
public domain does not impact the four
primary freedoms

150
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,780
closer still preserved by public to main
content

151
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,470
now since the fruit content is no money
one there's no one there to take away

152
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,730
our freedoms

153
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,610
no one streams are restricted that's
little bit different than the genu

154
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,380
project in the PR

155
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,630
in the corporations and people like
develops your commercials offer

156
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,120
their freedoms are restricted you
actually placing restrictions on them

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,080
and seeing the

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,430
you there's things that you can do and

159
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,030
that personally doesn't sit very well
with me I can consider myself a chain I

160
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,280
don't think that anyone

161
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,639
should she kinda impose other will on
others in kikwit people's freedom so

162
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,320
like

163
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,389
have always had a hard time putting
myself under the GPL knowing that I was

164
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,630
restricting people from doing things
that could

165
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,690
benefit everyone I'm because no one
streams are restricted

166
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,469
polygamy is much more friendly to
corporations and government obviously

167
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,110
because

168
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,449
anyone can take that source could anyone
can prove it anyone can shared anyone

169
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,058
can develop based on

170
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:37,308
I'm it's eventually were everything ends
up

171
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,598
anyway software that falls out of
copyright after the term papers over

172
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,309
is public domain software initially nah
I live if you actually look at the

173
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:48,300
environment and how soccer was treated
now

174
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,709
was considered it actually was
considered public domain was in

175
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:52,559
someone's property

176
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,610
wasn't something had to go ask for sure
if you refuse taking it

177
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,610
know that would have been a problem

178
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,720
but most importantly the idea public
domain involves a paradigm shift in the

179
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,209
way that people think this offer

180
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:08,519
instead of taking a I love it is
something that holds a lot of value that

181
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,740
has to be licensed

182
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,059
and you have to negotiate love the
people who use in something the you

183
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,219
doing a great good

184
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,769
by sharing with others no I think we
should think of software

185
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:24,149
and as like a discovery like mathematics
is just something that happens to exist

186
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,499
in the world it just happens to be the
best way to process information

187
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:31,660
so if we can start thinking of software
is not something that has diamonds

188
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,969
be sold and contractual negotiated up I
think we'll see a lot more rapid

189
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,800
progress will see a lot more suffer out
there was a lot more people using it

190
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,420
and we'll see I declining number people
who try and charge we're in trying to

191
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,229
charge exorbitant amount for

192
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,649
so went to use a little bit

193
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,189
know why is d-pa why is a public domain
better than open source LGPL

194
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:56,670
again no one streams are restricted it's
much more efficient programmers don't

195
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,079
have to spend time trying to understand
licenses

196
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:03,420
a did gene you plz pretty easy to read
license it was physically written that

197
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,868
way

198
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,490
but if you read the license is a some
other open source vendors like the IBM

199
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,149
license

200
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,809
%ah they're very complex numbers need
advice from a lawyer to really

201
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,920
understand and understand how you can
use code: in who you can sure the code

202
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,618
within

203
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:19,139
what kinda liabilities you open yourself
up to if you copy code from windows open

204
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:20,339
source projects

205
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,259
um I really think the program should
spend time programming and everything

206
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:24,819
hate

207
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:27,878
the law um like I said I'm libertarian
so

208
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,869
every paragraph laws something that I
really discreet jet

209
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:35,949
um in less duplication work is necessary

210
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,670
one of the things that people tend to do
with the face with a license they don't

211
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,420
understand

212
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,649
are they have too many licenses that
span the work to be able to do things

213
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,149
likely

214
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,899
relations it were really get a grasp on
and what can be done with it

215
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,430
is they tend to reaffirm in up and the
implementation is something that takes a

216
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,290
lot of time

217
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,139
and its very played with with her the
possibility a lawsuit

218
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,680
and and other problems in legal
entanglements um

219
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,699
so which best to avoid confrontation not
only for the legal problems with it but

220
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,459
also because it's i think is a waste the
time

221
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,749
on thing and bass bubblegum and i think
is at its lowest point legal landscape

222
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:15,589
I'm sure many you're familiar with the
Spurs have called up here that

223
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:20,269
information years to be free just the
sparks fly up for water six lowest point

224
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,339
%uh all information eventually becomes
public domain

225
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:28,569
so why not skip that the process
becoming far too many to school right to

226
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:29,550
the point

227
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,240
word it seems and naturally flow to work
actually wants to be

228
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,279
so we talked a bit about license
complexity know the fact that some

229
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,559
licenses are getting your multiple pages
long

230
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,540
involving many legal teams every company
seems to have his own license and

231
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,329
there's more more complexity licenses he
stays

232
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:50,569
I'm its when the major problems in the
open source movement

233
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:53,990
people can't necessarily tell without
legal advice if they can't recorder how

234
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,399
they can share the code

235
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,339
and anyone can and does traitor on
license I spent %ah

236
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,100
a number years on mean was calm license
discuss for the open source Institute

237
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,809
were people basically

238
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,459
propose licenses list and ask for
discussion on in terms of do the media

239
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,600
was like I lines are the things they
could get certified as open source

240
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,350
and we found is it amateur licenses are
arm they're not even legally valid

241
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,999
things would say

242
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:20,860
you can use my code but you can oppress
women in your day-to-day life issues my

243
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,689
code

244
00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:26,550
re: you can use my cool but you have to
support free tibet I'm

245
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,749
would you propose the list and and you
would you do with that

246
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,459
licenses and proposed to list which is
one and hadn't posted on the internet is

247
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:34,769
a is a license on

248
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:39,329
source code that you find um it's really
not in a position wanna be into trying

249
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,569
to do for licenses legally valid even
though it seems if it's not in our

250
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:46,550
trying happy tune and with the open
source is if you found is that the

251
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,240
they couldn't just keep up I'm there was
a time when yours as many as two new

252
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,970
licenses every week been posted to the
list

253
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,329
so in top of all that you have legal
diversity across your

254
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,889
just different jurisdictions you know
what's valid licensing in Europe is not

255
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:00,899
the same as america

256
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,790
and as we get into a more global
development model as more countries get

257
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,939
high-speed Internet access

258
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:10,599
nom it gets warmer complex and the laws
keep changing with lobbyists and groups

259
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:10,850
like

260
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:14,429
wtoo trying to enforce American
copyright in and values another

261
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:21,429
nations so really begun if I major types
a GP on the lg PRBS the MITM was a lot

262
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,730
um in if you think what you want to try
and by Cody conclude your project to see

263
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,579
some time

264
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:29,759
truth categories to be helpful things
like SourceForge in freshly used to

265
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:30,160
remove

266
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,730
onto basically categorized licenses you
cool internet licenses so you can search

267
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,529
and find the kind code that you need

268
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:40,559
but um more license complexity is needed

269
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,800
we would have all these licenses are
difficult to understand what we're

270
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,910
finding is that

271
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,999
things like like Richard success busy
holiday week evil is a major problem

272
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:53,459
um when you legally find a way around
someone's license

273
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,899
did did Greece the letter the lava not
necessarily

274
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,179
nature-inspired laws eroded they can you
get annoyed in the try and find ways to

275
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,220
keep you from doing that

276
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,860
the colony version license more
restrictions %uh

277
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,300
which inevitably leads to more
complexity we have a lot of new things

278
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,839
come out like dr. am

279
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,550
liability changes as Internet has become
more popular and more people are paying

280
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,639
attention to it

281
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,350
um a tremendously in larger basic people
who actually break tune

282
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,559
and have their own interests in their
own desires for licenses I'll

283
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,170
complex situation some work was actually
one has it like virtual

284
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,929
plant she based platforms a web
application service providers increase

285
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:32,069
in clusters

286
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:35,410
and license Content included with
applications know things like Google

287
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,480
Maps and

288
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,739
if you don't on the map in and how much
is offers actually licensee in his

289
00:14:39,739 --> 00:14:42,019
rookie use their API in your

290
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,199
your program and if you can use the API
keys the content as well

291
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,980
I'm we've been finding a blur between
hardware and software with things like

292
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,209
prom in know if I buy a computer from
from a vendor am i allowed to look at

293
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:53,619
the

294
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:56,949
brahmin you know if that prevents me
from putting a certain operating system

295
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,170
I like to move it

296
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,809
or am I even a lot reading

297
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:05,519
so as I said though opens for since you
had a large number problems trying to do

298
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,290
with these complex license key issues
that we're starting to emerge is polish

299
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,550
is the fact that there were so many
competing interests in all the new

300
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,059
people who kinda rush to suffer
development during the dot-com boom

301
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:17,350
um even today right now the open-source
institute has

302
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,819
59 preferred licenses on the homepage if
you can imagine or through

303
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:25,069
a major project major pieces source
column

304
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:29,279
something like scene of a sweet with
code under fifty nine different licenses

305
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,209
to try and determine how you can package
it

306
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,259
much can do little an extradition you
can see that that's a a pretty complex

307
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,529
problem

308
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:39,499
I'm license changes mean new review is
needed

309
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:43,429
so every time an author I'm disney
version license have got to make sure

310
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:46,480
that license compliance everything
you've done everything that they've done

311
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,970
and since his contract law making not
necessarily retroactively apply things

312
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,910
but they can make things difficult for
in the future issue release new versions

313
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,100
see you have to open to pass security
patch he may have to find urself

314
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,170
underneath the new version their license

315
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:02,420
um and I voice on that my sins authors
are not shy about

316
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,759
ever since we've seen your 30 or 40
virgins /a some licenses in a two year

317
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,860
time span

318
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,110
I'm suicides been trying to convince
people not

319
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,279
to right licenses you're not you did you
know pick one that has the kinda

320
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,639
basic features that you want the kinda
basic structure and try and stick

321
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,420
without a license

322
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,999
um it seems to work pretty well like I
said you're still 60 or more licenses

323
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,759
after that are frequently used

324
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,809
how we've gotten worse problems on the
horizon you know

325
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:32,389
one is knowledge represented 10
representation a derivative work

326
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,980
things like to smack Weber coming out
where people try to parsing sorry F

327
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,929
a whole fleece or school eventually you
parse into things like are you after we

328
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:42,639
can automatically Thomas first could
include in programs

329
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,009
so what do you do when

330
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:50,569
when source code %ah and its format is
day to become kinda intertwined

331
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:54,220
and how his license in effect that when
you're running an ESP program

332
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,369
like Google Maps or something like that
which become extremely popular

333
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:01,389
no one is ESP actually running and where
you are and where is the date and who

334
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,610
owns the data

335
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,800
and then distributed processing
applications that have models in code

336
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,740
automatically replicate and download

337
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,050
you know for thing at home in those
times applications who's responsible for

338
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,159
licensing their

339
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,530
I'm and and how does that work with
things like

340
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,970
the gene you GP also restrictions on
distributions first coaching

341
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,350
at the same time you know program is
getting much easier we've seen a massive

342
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,649
EP I introduced

343
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,910
things like job which have complete
networking tool kits complete

344
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,560
cryptographic toolkits

345
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,460
%ah complete data structures and
basically every paper be instructions

346
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,110
ever been in vent

347
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,650
PHP is very similar massive internet
repositories are becoming popular like

348
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,340
see pan

349
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,480
research who is automatically downloaded
I'm

350
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,370
it's not very easy to put licensing
restrictions on what you download from

351
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,490
CPM

352
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,940
you even easier languages are coming out
like Python and Ruby on Rails

353
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,880
which have even more complex problems
with licensing

354
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,020
so is free software has become
mainstream um

355
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,379
it's become like the best way to fern
someone just akashi the job so

356
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,940
deewana rate freeze operating haven't
necessarily been exposed to the same

357
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,500
culture the most of us have been

358
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,670
in it many years so what do they do
about licensing internationally educated

359
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,550
about it

360
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,990
us easiest way to learn new skills if
you want to learn how to program

361
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,830
well everyone will tell you sit on a
side project in a ride to text editor

362
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,820
and something like that but

363
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,929
as the number of open source projects
other Prof through Fri

364
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,380
and we see more MORE sureshkumar more
licenses it just gets more more complex

365
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,410
I'm companies are starting a fire Co
free software open source because it's

366
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,510
easy to support something like a blog on
a website that's wassup yourself without

367
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,110
actually

368
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,140
really investing significant income in
internet startups

369
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,280
you start on loan small mass capital are
really use a moderate

370
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,120
people even looking to running open
source projects a supplemental income

371
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,690
which when you get into to that you may
not necessarily license code you can

372
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,580
some documentation

373
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,230
books and so forth which really
complicated distance of

374
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,810
how do you win the competition when
other people are doing a

375
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,179
so it but the same time lot of people
were coming

376
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,300
to freeze off from becoming more focused
on it in getting involved in it

377
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,220
yeah Assaf is a group became a lot less
focused on the gene you project which

378
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,990
was actually a full replacement
happening system

379
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,270
I'm back in the nineteen nineties if you
want to get involved with the efforts at

380
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,310
your website in heaven list

381
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,540
love on the programs that they needed in
order to have a complete free operating

382
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,430
system

383
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,510
I'm that's no longer the case since
Linux

384
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,780
engine you first when x is for consumers
on the scene

385
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,500
there's less interest than focusing on
getting a complete operating system in

386
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,090
actually directing the community to
write specific portions cone

387
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,959
as a ruse on trying to address all these
complex licensing issues are coming up

388
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,050
no advocate increase offer to all the
companies in new types of software that

389
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,080
are emerging

390
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,679
and and basically says you can people on
water licences in mice offer should be

391
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,450
free and why it's important to have
access to it

392
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,070
but now we have a zit for US for nation
is completely split between commercial

393
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,899
interests in the Free Software
Foundation

394
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,810
we have no can you put an X in the nixon
all the distributions that are off

395
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,149
Jinyu for slacks um the BST distribution
that even new operating systems emerging

396
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,410
like react to OS

397
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:18,360
and with that split were getting even
more more duplication of work

398
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,730
we're seeing a lot of programs for
church I'm in order to way license

399
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,650
complex

400
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,740
a tremendous numbers ary implementations
a simple things like editors may

401
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,450
appliance

402
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,550
new graphic editors in your ID's and so
on if you actually go to the web

403
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,040
something like freshly you search for
some these

404
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,820
basic application 600 even sometimes
maybe a thousand different versions of

405
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,889
them if you actually search on the
Windows platform as well

406
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:43,430
and a lot of those are nothing more than
the you know the inclusion of a

407
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,220
component

408
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,580
in a basic application structure no
actual code run

409
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,540
up but code is produced in its license
since made available

410
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,610
I'm sock we better spend the time they
were

411
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,430
producing all the thousands of
applications with well I think number

412
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,600
one is innovating

413
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,030
nope the Free Software for community

414
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,920
actually tremendous amount of innovation
things like this should hash tables and

415
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,750
stuff like that it might be educational
sector almost always emerge first

416
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,010
israel's offer

417
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,379
by the Pew Pew revolution I think will
emerge from the trees offer

418
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,780
a community but

419
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,379
right now I think we're spending so much
time a implementing things to what

420
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,220
licensing conflicts that that's really
getting graded Anderson

421
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,240
lot less so that going on I'm we are
running his many free software

422
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,560
applications replace

423
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,879
you know commercial applications no to
do functions that free software

424
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,500
applications in Texas for

425
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,430
we're not doing as much algorithm
improvement there hasn't been a lot and

426
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,560
search algorithms there hasn't been

427
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,540
I dramatic improvements to some the
optimization to the compilers in the

428
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,180
different languages things that we

429
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,550
would like to see for some examples you
can look at some the new chips with I'll

430
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,330
be back

431
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,669
you know some time %um ships and some
other Yemen Mexico

432
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,060
you know places were for supper
applications can benefit from those

433
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,500
types of

434
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,500
basic structural architectural changes
in microprocessors I'm

435
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,940
were most projects just our picnic
anything up

436
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,760
come we could be writing code for
emerging sciences like bioinformatics in

437
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,850
grid computing

438
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,150
or even doing things like your p no
payrolls no business in fish in sea

439
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,440
creatures

440
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,680
in would welcome that was what we want
to do um

441
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,310
yeah I'm certainly not going to tell you
have to go running your pee system if

442
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,820
you wanna write another editor

443
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,830
um but is the goal

444
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,179
for most of us what Richard said that
you know all software should be free

445
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,680
in me personally that's that's not the
primary motivation from your increase

446
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,360
offer

447
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,560
I it's not as important as I think other
things like

448
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,610
you know rapid technological and
scientific advancement I'd really like

449
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,600
to travel into space

450
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,950
I'm a huge fan of %uh Richard Branson
some space projects and stuff like that

451
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:46,520
and

452
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,470
if we get up nasa ensuring more they're
cool in working with them to produce

453
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,240
code in that kinda thing I think that we
can kinda pushed ahead if if everyone

454
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,840
had access

455
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,340
some other some the software and some
other things that are going on there

456
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,459
um reduce computing cost energy projects

457
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,430
II cheaper products and and higher wages
rock result if company spent less money

458
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,560
on suffer in economic debates between
you have all

459
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,919
church code you have things that are
actually sold %ah do is find a mixed

460
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,870
model

461
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,140
obviously a basic level guarantees like
health care nutrition

462
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,110
your shelter people make sure you don't
starve to death as part of government

463
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,370
higher levels rip our competition get to
privatization most companies in the

464
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,300
commercial sector

465
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,950
and limited scholarships for bass agrees
not everyone does the school for the

466
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,330
entire life you have to compete if you
want to get there

467
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,129
in in some natural nationalization
things like you know mining oil

468
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,090
so what would a mixed model look like
Chris offer

469
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:45,459
um hopefully when I would like to see is
is basic infrastructural code the stuff

470
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,970
we're writing over and over and over
again

471
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,640
be public domain %ah the more complex
software

472
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,160
some the newer stuff long after falling
to the copy left so the copula policy

473
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,480
can actually force other people want to
work in that area to release a code

474
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
but what good is the GPR really do with
the base upstate data structure

475
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,190
implementation with that code is already
free and everyone already has free

476
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,170
copies of it

477
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,670
the copula doesn't provide a lot about
himself we can to solidify

478
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,430
a small number %uh versions love say
destruction libraries for

479
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,480
basic system libraries you can't just
mopping colonel we spend a lot less time

480
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,990
on that

481
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,420
area and we'll be able to move up in a
more important things up

482
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,980
to maybe no justification for commercial
products at the very high and

483
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,120
things like specific research in in
medical areas and things like that

484
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,910
in my reading an operating system right
now %uh short answers now

485
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:41,940
long answer is yes I am %uh we're trying
to do is copy the link so should be Shin

486
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,630
is at its core all Potter main

487
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,060
suffer Saban reprinting are the basic
Linux commands

488
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,800
awesome the basic libraries and I
started on a small colonel

489
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,760
um its peace we completely written from
scratch and this can redistribute is

490
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,780
public domain

491
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,080
I'm the idea being that

492
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,879
if we can get one distribution out there
it'll provide kind about

493
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,180
escape hatch pressure release for
everybody who's who/ savage

494
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,060
you know struggles with this kind of
problem um hopefully

495
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,669
to be a step by step placement on I'm
not gonna hold off until I have complete

496
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,520
pop domain

497
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,680
up ports like packaging patch management
will be available

498
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,620
um I'm also trying to put your code
repositories is a do this you are soo

499
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,670
representations in cryptographic code

500
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,750
so what's stopping people from from
dismaying this kinda stuff in doing

501
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,480
public domain

502
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,750
companies you know the rep you miles to
work suffer the snap on her right

503
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,850
other support concerns you for things
like evil

504
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,800
if modify your TiVo code newtie will no
longer work she on the senate back to

505
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,440
repair

506
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,420
you hadn't come on how to fix it in the
educational sector

507
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,970
there's really no identity crisis in
American schools right now no

508
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,030
are they a public institution educate
people are their research institution to

509
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,260
do research and generate funding in
income from that are they there to spin

510
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,620
off

511
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,490
no technology transfer companies are you
there to educate students

512
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,410
um a lot of schools are becoming very
secretive about the source

513
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,460
with your source code to suffer projects
and stuff because they're trying to spin

514
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,590
off and commercial companies

515
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,320
there's extensive competition for
government grants next like that

516
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,560
scientists are competing with each other
so that no one should the source code

517
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,620
%ah want a more complex things I think

518
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,640
is the grants you basically have two

519
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,940
have some kinda metric to determine how
useful is a software

520
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,740
that these these doctors if you've
written we've been a grant to develop

521
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,360
for example NH or something like that
and right now it's really based on two

522
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,030
things usage in reputation

523
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,550
as an example I wrote a young

524
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,139
sample size calculator for basically
clinical trials

525
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,220
with some researchers I was at the
University a4a

526
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,590
and I trying to convince them that put
into the GPL a distributed network

527
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,860
willing to do that because he said you
know when we apply for the grant to

528
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,880
support just

529
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,170
research that involves no funding the
mathematicians who develop these models

530
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,190
um

531
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,460
we have to provide some magical how many
people using these models are useful are

532
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:04,980
there

533
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,040
%ah are they worth while and what they
were doing is basically county websites

534
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,550
for the number times it was ron

535
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,500
so you know would be more efficient
running on a local computer and then

536
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,970
basically tissue disorders consumers can
look at it

537
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,210
it was kept on a server so the do really
protect and provide metres from the

538
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:20,800
grants

539
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,940
um again house after protector education
so just like even with someone modify

540
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,890
that offer

541
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,210
and still sites it is useful um any

542
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,450
modified in with chris is an actor
result it's a major problem

543
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,260
here's cryptographic solutions that
people code verification is a great

544
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,770
example that

545
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,330
um basically with you is going to do is
no checks on

546
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:46,580
the source code a digital signature
verification if it's not there something

547
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,780
wrong

548
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,180
there's a lot of similar ways you can't
do that new digital signature City

549
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,610
output uses one way to avoid doing with
the actual source code to the force you

550
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,400
to a server when they want something
that's actually

551
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,640
no value runnable I'm if you wanna down
the coup

552
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,050
and produce output if you're planning
your own you said you can do that but

553
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,360
you want something to you publishing
recognizes something this useful to

554
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,170
someone

555
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,030
when you have to go to a server that
actually has a digital signature

556
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,600
infrastructures part image

557
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,980
you know you give you a signed output
rather than just known basic output

558
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,510
um you can digitally sign your source
code as well

559
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,450
I'm make sure that you know people are
valuing the source code

560
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,580
now summer breezes nAChR song nascent
resource code it's verifiable by digital

561
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,639
signature

562
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,150
on you can even do complete identity
protection PGP keys

563
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,310
and um I don't go in that too deeply
during the stock but I do have another

564
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,149
talk right actually show

565
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,190
other structures I've suffer signatures
in the different formats a PGP keys in

566
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,150
Suffern actually go through exactly what
happens when you signed source code

567
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:51,950
and what kinda packets you produce and
how did to cook and kudos package

568
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,800
others also some legal mechanisms
available trademark laws is been very

569
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,500
successful

570
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,240
no we saw that with Mozilla Netscape is
basically said that

571
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,900
you people could download copies of
Mozilla modifier but they couldn't call

572
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,840
it was a lack they had modified

573
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,710
com I think that might be something
useful for people to look into you

574
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,910
yeah who are unable to support hi GPL

575
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,510
who are nervous about using public
domain suffer

576
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,060
as a as a formidable should be Shin um

577
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,800
patten's I really don't like Kanye I
don't really see

578
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,880
how useful national patents source code
itself could be your source code model

579
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,520
but

580
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,920
nope acting something like a a technique
and inserting same

581
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,550
no be logically actor beads inside
tumors or something like that

582
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,370
and then being able to distribute to
source code because you have patented

583
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,600
the actual

584
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,720
method of treatment you know that's
possibly awaited times people can

585
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,230
currently leases first 22

586
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,180
I think it's important look for
alternatives to cop you contract marked

587
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,670
his contract was very

588
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,670
very complex I'm and always

589
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:56,990
almost always involves really long term
mediations and negotiations in court

590
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,700
alternatives copyright laws while are
you give them the term copyrights we can

591
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
you say that

592
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,780
you this cop this %uh first country in
for a few three years after which

593
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,460
becomes public domain

594
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,860
so why should use a developer public
domain your work I you said it

595
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,230
eliminates the need for

596
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,480
re fermentation it's more efficient
there's less versions for other people

597
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,700
to ship through

598
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,970
it saves you from having to deal with
the complexity of licenses

599
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,230
and it sees others from having to do
with the licenses while

600
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,760
I'm the last easier automation good
example releases a problem now is with

601
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,080
the gentle humor to system

602
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,649
one encounters commercial suffer like to
JDK you actually have to intervene by

603
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,510
hand in Mercer saw for yourself

604
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:39,070
haha so you can agree to the licensing
terms I'm

605
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,480
I think we're getting close to a point
where computers can be some other on

606
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,330
programming themselves taken some wheels

607
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,850
major software system components and
follows components have country

608
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:52,270
licenses maybe you know for him deeply
difficult front wheel to do that

609
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,629
in basic things in the public domain
reduces liability because it's

610
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,100
essentially a good faith effort

611
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,200
it's not and contract negotiation likely
GPR

612
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,370
where you're going to provide something
in exchange for something

613
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,180
um and again to communicate a lot a lack
of Mount resign

614
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,620
suffer so how to get involved

615
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,010
if you actually wanna start running
arguments offered to working on the next

616
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,040
the solution I'm gonna try and you or
%ah

617
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,070
if you actually want you are can help us
map out last week ago and so forth

618
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,270
um really just starting out there's not
much are your up

619
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,800
but keep in touch and be patient hope we
could use in source code on

620
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,230
there's a website with limited
information and that's why militarists

621
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,210
and questions

622
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,790
yes

623
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:49,790
so

624
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:57,510
here

625
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:04,510
use

626
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:13,049
sons

627
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:16,570
you say do stuff public domain instead

628
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,120
what is the major argument that they
give you not to do that what what do

629
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,789
they not like

630
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:25,840
your um I think the biggest concern is
that you play something the public

631
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,570
domain

632
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:31,649
I'm you're not explicitly having people
accept the fact that you have no

633
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:32,360
liability

634
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,929
which is one of the major portions are
the BST and MIT license is

635
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:40,490
is know by using this offer you've read
it you know and and so forth

636
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,950
um I find the people easy going to do
with all the biggest problem I have is

637
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,809
that people

638
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,269
have the struggle with the complexity of
it like myself for example have a

639
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,279
product I would like to

640
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,169
to move into polygamy but I can't
because a one of the guys who contribute

641
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:54,759
actress

642
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:57,809
had an unfortunate passed away and he
had

643
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:02,470
contributed patches is GPL so know how
do I get permission from him to rely

644
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,509
since I source com

645
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:07,240
an ETA and you the GPL press you just
taking it and I could be implemented

646
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,500
but his stuff is pretty efficient
anti-reform in

647
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,870
it's such it's such a basic level that
have to do an inefficient way and that's

648
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,029
that's not pretty so

649
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:20,049
um mica said answer question I don't
find much resistance but the resistance

650
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,429
is mainly liability related

651
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:24,919
yes well

652
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:28,129
I've been that have been developed for
for many years and

653
00:33:28,129 --> 00:33:33,620
suffering with licenses and things like
that so I have some perspective on their

654
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,899
the generally poorly written

655
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:43,159
licenses and for the selected license is
generally the software not be in use

656
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,620
basically it dies and you mentioned
years some libertarian viewpoint

657
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,909
I agree with that on why not just let
the free market like crazy licenses died

658
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:56,570
%uh look I was trying to demonstrate
with a a

659
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,379
essentially that the permit fine I'm
with the public a man on the bottom

660
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:02,950
three suffer in the middle and the
course of a topic that

661
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,139
I think we could do have increased
efficiency in the market even center

662
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:07,750
valign

663
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,589
on I nope it was time to sort through
that

664
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:15,040
we london keyes our time to program and
we sorted through it by your

665
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,219
may consider it was good reference
implementations at the very bottom

666
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,270
no sensually preventing that suffer from

667
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:28,270
can emerge in the first place we're
having a better solution will more

668
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:30,379
questions

669
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:30,629
things are
