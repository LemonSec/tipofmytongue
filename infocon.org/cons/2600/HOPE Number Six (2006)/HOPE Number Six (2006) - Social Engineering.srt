1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,010
alright coming up next is the social
engineering

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,149
section and panel uphold these have been
a

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,320
legendary and DVD man is standing by

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,760
to burn copies have this so you can

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,830
take it home with me handed off to
friends

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,680
are in the past before this panel memos
and emails have gone out

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,780
every are in corporate environments

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,440
to pay attention during this weekend cuz
things happen

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,010
so without any more delay

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:39,050
or sound tests the menu both seen

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:46,050
I guess

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,059
I just wanna say you know it's an
incredible amount of pressure

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,850
to have to come up every two years and
do something clever on the phone

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,380
on it this has been torture for the last
however many totten

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,420
weeks have been thinking about it up
until this very moment where start no

16
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,300
clue what I'm gonna do

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,780
are so I let's let's hope for the best
buy that for the rest that the

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,240
the panel panelists to introduce
themselves so many from have gotten no

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,960
sleep at all

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,330
over the past couple days so bear with
us if sometimes we say things that make

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,520
any sense or if we

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,810
the something completely bizarre arts
over there

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:28,810
for 113 I merger Cheshire the Cheshire
catalyst

24
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,070
I am Number 134

25
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:44,070
pretty ass

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:51,180
on number two Gavin I guess that means
you know the number one Kevin

27
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,850
alright who's not here unfortunately

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,619
and hopefully he'll be and you know what
we're gonna have updates on all the

29
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,829
various victims

30
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:04,860
up the conference I hopefully by the
closing ceremonies we don't know about

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,270
Steve yet and

32
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,280
of Luna something by the time we finish
up tonight on

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,379
Cheshire now you've been around the I
can see for quite some time and then

34
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:14,829
maybe

35
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,950
a definition of what social engineering
is a good way to start

36
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,530
okay we'll social engineering is when

37
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,250
you need some information from someone
and you have to convince them that

38
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,790
not only are you one of them the you
deserve to have the information

39
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,519
and trying to convince them that giving
you that information

40
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,230
is the right thing to do %uh

41
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,190
John Draper first semester this he would
call up a telephone switch room

42
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,900
and throw so much jargon at them for the
first had a few notes which min

43
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,670
and you just one little bit of
information 20

44
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,079
unable to place his phone call to
Rushford an hour

45
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,709
at just listening to the way he would
badger the guide

46
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,350
my Plaza neck to go get some rest before
the meeting a friend

47
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:10,549
just of just a marvel to behold but
that's really it its

48
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,049
convincing your victim that

49
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,579
I'll you are you know as downtrodden as
he is

50
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,769
you're just in the other office a

51
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,680
reader crossed on a cross-country and
you just need the one thing that I know

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,690
you're not supposed to give it up with
you know it's

53
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,250
among us is OK that's pretty much what
social engineering is as convincing him

54
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,599
that you are a good guy along with them
it's lying

55
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,760
I line is wrong

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,768
not not always not always I disagree i
won

57
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:45,410
and when I think about doing this I

58
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,440
yeah over for crime

59
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,228
I yet they'll get in prison to but on

60
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,030
I I find it a bigger challenge to not
lie

61
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,269
and to make your your mark think you
said something

62
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:04,299
that you didn't say arm

63
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:09,549
creative truth-telling not even if we
create to try to just phrasing

64
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,280
manner of speech I 10 ality

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,630
all these things are just as effective
as the content of what you're saying

66
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,029
and if you say with an authoritative
tone I

67
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,419
in phrase in the right way on people
just serviced and attention will just

68
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,659
spread out all kinds information so I
find it much more challenging to

69
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,830
to not commit I

70
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,609
phone fraud by lying or what was that
wire fraud when you

71
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,620
you actually lie over the phone to get
something

72
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,840
a value so on snot was lying

73
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,900
okay well

74
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,930
me i've a different view as far as the
swine goes I mean the

75
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,090
I mean people who are complete strangers
voices in a in a

76
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,220
will telephone you don't have to tell
them

77
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,449
what you really believe who you really
are you don't have to do things like

78
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,919
that you don't wanna hurt these people
you don't wanna make them

79
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,948
run their lies or anything like that but
telling I i lied to our

80
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:12,020
an american express operator someplace
to get information

81
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,310
I don't think it's a bad thing what you
do that information of course that's

82
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,110
different if he is that our people

83
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,370
that's that's not a good thing always
somewhere we what we doing

84
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,259
situations like this for fun and to
demonstrate to demonstrate our

85
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,830
appoints to demonstrate that sometimes I
am

86
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,229
the information that should be protected
is the information at least protected

87
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,289
arm I'm thinking while been up you
actually burn you have

88
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:40,310
you have an age thing memo from from the
hotel's you haven't even seen yes yes I

89
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,900
haven't seen this years old

90
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,210
cold turkey and Michael turkey this is
totally impromptu thing

91
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,250
I found this a internal hotel manana on
the in the hallway

92
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,350
on it a freight elevator to break into
the office yeah

93
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,590
authorized to be there whatever that
night pick it up in here it is

94
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,779
I'm so assess the theme for the mood
that's been around this time again he is

95
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:00,770
that today

96
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,008
with the grave for social engineering
purposes it doesn't get us kicked out

97
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:11,009
on what Sunday afternoon I hope this is
in our final hope

98
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,870
and this is this is an email print out
an email message to all the

99
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,949
managers for supervisors and employees
to

100
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,150
to my walking by in the hallway and a

101
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,849
I'm I think about the actual email
addresses but but or a domain name you

102
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,259
can guess that is set to

103
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,789
hotel Penn everybody at whatever

104
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:40,248
on important update 3:30 p.m. this is a
Wednesday this week

105
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,430
it's from I someone at a company

106
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,229
named energy curtailment specialists

107
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:54,229
Inc I want that title I wanna be the
energy curtailment specialist

108
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:59,210
you got too much energy slowdown

109
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,219
up it says here a

110
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:05,659
there continue to be candid there
continue to be problems

111
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:09,169
with down transmission lines overheated
transformers cabling problems with Con

112
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,058
Ed center and the fear is that the
entire transmission system

113
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:14,599
infrastructure may collapse under
further stress

114
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,990
yeah and cause not only a blackout but a
longer-term blackout

115
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,520
and a doesn't mean exactly no

116
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,580
in it the entire transmission system
infrastructure may collapse

117
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,169
it's as pretty armageddon like could we
have picked a better weekend

118
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:36,688
yeah they were just a again a few days
early I guess

119
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,749
and the predictions but that goes on to
say that I could see the emails

120
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:43,199
this one year says obviously problems
are so severe that they're asking for

121
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,789
help right away there are numerous fires
transformers

122
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,669
transfers overheating transmissions
lines down its center throughout the

123
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,878
area the problems will worsen throughout
the afternoon

124
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,900
he goes on to say stuff this is a bitch
peculiar problem that happens

125
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,900
almost never in fact it is never happens

126
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,260
so

127
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,210
I'm wondering if somebody from energy
curtailment specialists

128
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,050
who work in issue these kinda dire
warnings and commands to

129
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,410
management at the hotel in other places
if a

130
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:24,400
someone from this company recall and
requested information

131
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,400
only inmate in I'm working on something

cry when I will do

143
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,349
when I will do is a take advantage

144
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,010
have the the above the fear that's
currently surrounding us

145
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,319
are two maybe get some information that
supposed to get

146
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,020
arm and I have to say this this is like
divine providence here because some

147
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,120
I really didn't know what we're going to
do with them in the past we've done

148

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,990
arm we convinced that Taco Bell last
time to

151
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:50,990
turn off the cash registers for five
minutes not serve anybody

152
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,790
a few years ago we are we managed to
transfer ourselves to the

153
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,860
PA system I think I a Kmart in hotel

154

156
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,310

focus on what everybody in the city is

157
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,650
is are talking about no bernie made
references I was listening completely

158
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,920
but you're making reference to

159
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,829
all the power problems you guys aware
that for the last seven days their place

160
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,670
in Queens it had no power

161
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,719
Queens being the bar across the way
River it's unbelievable it's like they

162
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,880
they forgot how to do it they forgot
hello had provide power these places

163
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,150
that

164
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,819
our parent company is called con Edison
their

165
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,770
first customer must have been named
edison or something I don't know by I

166
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,560
think connie is it is the definition
Turner

167
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,470
yeah they're not them they're not the
most popular entity in

168
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,160
in in the city right now so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna call

169
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,579
I we're gonna call place I

170
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,790
a business that may or may not be
affected by the power

171
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,540
problems but regardless what they are
affected mins for the fun that they're

172
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,430
not affected they certainly know that
there's a power situation

173
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,970
and my guess is that they'll be a little
bit more the

174
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,990
gullible a little bit more open with
information than they should be

yes the problem is in Greenpoint

242
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,500
okay but the problem has been expanding
in the past couple days a much as you

243

afford

245
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,040
the restaurant is in Greenpoint I i
understand that

246
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,880
but we need to know that there are no
additional problems a minute or two for

247
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,900
has been there to be able to get access
are

248
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,690
what you're saying is that line from
Asian the 10

249
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,940
can be sick it's possible that there
might be additional brownouts and we're

250
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,760
trying to

251
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,079
contact business before this happens so
what we need from you is

thanks for your help okay alright

290
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:37,230
language barriers can be well I mean
there was a ridiculously I was like

291
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,409
calling one in a foreign country or
something where they are to be

292
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:41,740
translated as call in Queens

293
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,669
but so know that was the most successful
%uh vulvar I i've are

294
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:52,169
attempts but what we do have now is
Commission going to their basement

295
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:56,240
so if I i please don't do this but if if
any buyer to go over there

296
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,140
it's the I say there with Con Edison you
have unfettered access to their

297
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,460
equipment down there might be nice to
dress up I guess but

298
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,290
I'll bet you don't have to do that when
I was trying to get was

299
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,418
was more information and i think is if I
got somebody that

300
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,350
I could talk directly to our be able to
get them to go into the office get the

301
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,480
Con Ed bill get

302
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,360
the account number and through that may
be more from members

303
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,550
and as you can see the there's no reason
you should stay on the phone with

304
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,300
somebody who's talking nonsense that
long

305
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,220
bite you you do when there's a situation
as a crisis going on

306
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,860
you stay on the phone so that the crisis
doesn't hit you in some way and

307
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,240
everybody has heard about this

308

closer to where the actual power

309
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,330
problems where

identity for are

417
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,639
the maximum number of characters is 14
character actually 20 characters

418
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:17,870
available on the wheel but you need care

441
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,500
0 this is where its in Figures mode and

443
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:47,720
the computer to come through our I guess
got three hundred pages that the

444
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,409
with that they don't miss meet last week

445
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:55,500
I sent four milligrams last week could

454
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,909

to print out the time

455
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:32,770
was very early in their career and all
other messages want to make tea

456
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,869
I think just I've always pictured in my
mind the scene

457
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:42,679
where the exception for comes out and
they see quelques are four freaks

519
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,219
of time

520
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,389

526
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,450
they're gonna do it and turned my host
to

527
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:42,540
did his homework respect because you are
talking about I outstrips

528
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,739
and but it was fun those were really

529
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,580
brady's okay aren't we we found a
mcconnell's actually answer the phone in

530
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,649
the affected area

531
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:55,250
we're gonna give that a shot and them we
have a couple other ideas

532
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,220
other things to do but term at this one
as a quick story to that

533
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,540
because they remind me of something that
you can basically get people do all

534
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,349
sorts of things I V

535
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:09,060
just convince them that you're somebody
into a position of authority

536
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,490
and there've been some monumental
examples of that here in New York

537
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:17,500
or assume some friends of mine I were
able to actually call a phone company

538
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,440
by was New York Telephone back when they
were around and

539
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,020
tell them that the new badges were being
issues

540
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,980
for Monday and they said this to the
night watchman and that they needed

541
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,109
to do to collect their all badges

542
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:36,359
the the first before they could deliver
them and they will be sending a

543
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:39,089
messenger rounded pick them out

544
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:42,420
I like my I don't know what kind of
people they hire but

545
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,540
good lord

546
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,390
a stack up by these are all these people
inside the company and god knows what

547
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,759
you can do with that of course you know
you

548
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,080
nobody look anything like them but still
I mean come on giving away your ID for

549
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,670
god sake

550
00:35:55,670 --> 00:36:00,010
another time manuals here we are with
switching the manuals we need that

551
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,660
you know that for the cosmos system we
need the the old manuals please

552
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,339
leave them in loading zone could have
been easier

553
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:10,319
so people like a little though they work
with what you ask some time to see if we

today and

638
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,559
see what they do with the air
conditioning I would like to got more

639
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:23,240
information at them but you know I think
I think with the wrong with corporate

640
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,700
franchise is here that I actually get
the bills themselves as oil the demand

641
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,359
things you can do but you can find out
things like

642
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,630
where's where's access can I get access
whether where these people's names what

643
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,640
are the phone numbers

644
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,578
and this basically you gotta get them
thinking that you're on their side that

645
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:38,630
you're working with them

646
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,030
and before you know it you can you can
be kind of noxious and say things like I

647
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,450
need you to do this for May

648
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,869
psych the fuck a year why should I do
anything for you but

649
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:50,490
that's what people do if your house may
say that to you you're being social

650
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,210
engineer cops say that all the time

651
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,490
island people and and and all sorts of
positions a semi authority will say

652
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,539
I need you to do this one hurts too bad
that I'm not gonna do it

653
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:04,339
that's my reaction arm okay that's one
thing we we have with a couple things to

654
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:05,089
try but

655
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,299
any other stories actually AM I can
remember to

656
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:11,339
your with an organization called tell a
freak which

657
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:15,078
and political people they do good things
I might have something about

658
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:21,970
but these guys are up too fun ones well
basically tell a free dessert

659
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,589
it started out being as a a way to get
anonymous Fri voicemail

660
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:29,509
and then we've expanded upon phone
conferences in the ass to access them

661
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,589
so basically we run a

662
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,710
a conference that allows people from all
over the world to

663
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,430
basically calling for using VoIP and
just discussed things that relate to the

664
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,529
phones hacking

665
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:44,520
social engineering or things like that
some thats

666
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,240
really I'd concert USIA

667
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:55,069
social engineering planet for you as an
example of something lol

668
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:58,558
I'll try to find other phone number here
um

669
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,359
well I just basically my my greatest
feat was

670
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:05,569
day an operator to think I was the fire
warden

671
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:08,680
and three weighing the operator the
conference

672
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,879
into a elevator in Michigan so during
rush hour in the elevator

673
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,670
I was talking to people in the elevator
having them push buttons go to different

674
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,079
floors get off get on

675
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:26,680
and %ah

676
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,180
the whole time the operator had no idea
what's going on

677
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:35,828
so I mean I guess that's not exactly
socializing is more being a bastard

678
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:39,410
a if

679
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:45,220
yeah okay well I that's

680
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,920
education of constructive

681
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,520
but they can have fun it's like this
like we did with that I'll Taco Bell

682
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,130
thing you know we tell people I revving
up trouble

683
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,609
argue or twice a the surfer soundtrack
from

684
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:02,589
people this do whatever you tell them to
do erasure engine for us

685
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:06,109

688
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,970
on but a sometimes sometimes

689
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:21,240
your best victims are the people who
really should be your worst victims and

690
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,089
what I mean by that

691
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:25,490
I mean educated people people who want
to protect their privacy

692

I love taking their address out of the
phone book

694
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,150
to see if it's possible to use

695
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:41,770
their obvious desire for privacy to

696
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:45,690
invade their privacy and out what's if
they start to give the address will of

00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:04,039
play okay and we also wanted to ask if

765
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:08,130
you have your name added to the do not
mail list I already have that I

766
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:11,849
I accident on their registry just began
this month so

767
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:15,319
together edit right can you verify your
address so that we don't send you

768
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:15,808
anything

769
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:20,020
what I'll what's my name and address do
you have Arctic we don't have that

770
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,220
information we do I don't understand the
phone number if you could give us the

771
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,010
address will make sure that you do not
get

772
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,460
okay to offer thank you

773
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:35,460
I

774
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:42,110
so not everybody is educated as you can
say and this is somebody went to the

775
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:43,800
trouble of not putting their address

776
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,310
in the in the phone book I should also
point out you know I love you

777
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:51,750
meant mine I realize this are you pay
for an unlisted phone which is really

778
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,370
silly

779
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:56,359
you're paying not to be in the book you
can simply change your name your you

780
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,270
listed name

781
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,830
have a funny name and then when somebody
asks for joe shmoe or whatever

782
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:05,069
you know they're looking in the phone
book and you can also have the address

783
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,230
not listed

784
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:10,320
just your name so that people bone get
your address at the phone book

785
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,240
and something else you should be aware
of is that even when you do that when

786
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,910
you don't have an address in the phone
book

787
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,970
the information operator does have that
information in fact even when you're

788
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,820
unlisted

789
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,940
the information operator can see your
address they cannot tell you

790
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,470
tell the person calling what the address
is but they can answer yes or no

791
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:32,370
is it this is it that is a greater than
this is a greater than that and we've

792
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,730
had many a fun evening

793
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:38,320
tracking down people by by having Yes No
chats with various operators

794
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,200
back on information was free maybe
that's why it's not anymore arm

795
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,480
there also is a trick to brew protecting
your privacy but the the biggest thing

796
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,040
of all is just to be aware

797
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:52,850
to not let yourself get scammed I when
people call you on the phone

798
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:56,140
don't give out information call them and

799
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,330
when you know you're talking to on the
about the information that you feel

800
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,440
comfortable giving out

801
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,160
on and that's really the I think the
best advice that we can offer

802
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,890
I okay jello I'm told is going to be
here

803
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,920
in about 10 minutes so we're gonna wrap
up here with

804
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,760
maybe if they want to ask questions
those microphones up there

805
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,640
I'm all found out so Cheshire anymore

806
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,980
arrest people here go ahead question but
just the

807
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,150
following up on what you just said
sometimes you can

808
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:29,670
pinpoint an address for unless that
person

809
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,610
I had a friend who was tried we knew
that a particular celebrity i

810
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:37,230
who may still live on Barrow Street so I
won't use the name %ah

811
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,830
knew that this person lived on that
street but wasn't sure if the exact

812
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:41,569
address

813
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:44,770
called information said I

814
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:50,330
I want them number for XYZ on number 12
Barrow Street and they said I'm sorry

815
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,310
that's unlisted

816
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:55,700
for you just give your address united
with the name well but but she said

817
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,760
but I do have the right address number
12 now it's number ten

818
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,750
at a at a given number so sometimes the
operator

819
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,980
I guess now that it's mostly automated
you can't do that but if you actually

820
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,670
talk to a human in those places where
they still are there

821
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:12,470
you can get away with it one really cold
fact that I'd like to tell people about

822
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:13,050
their

823
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,090
we actually did last year I is

824
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:20,460
basically making use SAV a VoIP services

825
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,690
and the ability to change caller-id view
guys mister are changing caller ID

826
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,370
authorities a story there catch on to
this realize hey that's coming out a

827
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,029
good thing too

828
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:33,670
be able to do and now they're making
laws in things but I lot of a still have

829
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:37,260
the capability of programming switches
and and and

830
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:41,070
asterisk box and things like that and
basically changing your phone number

831
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,180
said hey look the White House is calling
me I'm

832
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,940
on your cell phone what's what's cool
about that and that this is actually

833
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,990
something I thought I've

834
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:53,490
a when when you make that kind of a
phone call

835
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,830
you get the name a that the number but
you also

836
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,840
get the name sometimes because what
happens is when that number arrives at

837
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,100
your central office

838
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:07,110
your central office does a lookup right
there and then and they see that number

839
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:12,440
and they match it to a name alright not
name is not calling you

840
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,080
by you see the name on your caller ID
device so it's whatever

841
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,120
a former River scanning we're basically

842
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:25,390
who lives at that 21 22 28 1234 I'm
gonna program at that phone number into

843
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,529
my ass response call my other number

844
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:30,680
and look at the caller ID display in
Haiti joe shmoe

845
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,030
that's who lives there you look at the
address but you will get the name now

846
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,830
imagine

847
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:38,990
if you were to program an asterisk box
or whatever you have set up

848
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:42,910
to call and a number increments by one

849
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,690
call the number again in command by one
over and over and over again

850
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:50,430
you would get an entire exchange-listed

851
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,680
and unlisted phone numbers with people's
names now

852
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,480
when you do this to neighborhoods such
as oh I don't know Hollywood

853
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,130
for Washington DC you get quite a few
interesting names

854
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:06,060
and they cannot hide all the tricks that
that we've told you as far as

855
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,960
changing your name or or changing your
your address so you're not listening

856
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,540
your address

857
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,930
they don't work because this is the bill
name

858
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:17,960
if his bill to somebody's name is gonna
show up on the caller ID box

859
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,960
and that's just pretty wacky that the
thing that stopped does eventually was

860
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,120
I'm an email from the VoIP providers
saying we're seeing a fantastic number

861
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:26,529
of

862
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,190
I have attempts that the call was even
being completed you didn't have to pick

863
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,190
up the phone

864
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:34,830
but they were seeing I think something
on the order of 10,000

865
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:39,880
different phone calls from different
numbers that were never answered them

866
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:44,610
Marwijk map that entire exchange that
way are we sure got them a little peeved

867
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:48,150
I but it just goes to show if if you
actually

868
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:51,850
run one of those companies what you can
do that information is there

869
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:55,830
it's out there is no way that the listed
we looked at least not yet

870
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:00,950
so don't do that many are concluding
about money went

871
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,430
I thought you fell asleep with its been
a long night

872
