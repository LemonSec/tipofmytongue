1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,050
being will be around until about 2 on
down the second floor

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,360
and the about 1:30 I think they stop
giving tests for the

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,379
for the him license for the tech license

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,410
arm with that

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:21,410
I introduce number one thirty in number
108

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,929
does not work alright

7
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:34,670
missed at the podium cuz I wanna be like
Hitler I guess this is a good work

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,050
either

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:41,050
in yesterday I was laughing at Kitana
cuz he was so hungover

10
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:47,230
and now that's happening to me it's not
funny alright certain

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,690
this presentation on abilities in a
connected future night paula jones for

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,229
the confusing title

13
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,739
its actually a lot of our smarthome
hacking

14
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,820
and down and some other stuff too we
actually modify the presentation today

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,229
it's way too long so we're gonna fly
through some the stuff to try to get

16
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,770
as much as possible and down both mean
quite on our

17
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,899
veterans and we have a little bit about
the whole veterans

18
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:17,080
now identity theft thing that's been
going on

19
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,300
change

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,380
I 89 pass that document versioning

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,679
back in stock comforts such stocks that
each team now alright

22
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:33,660
a smart home the color socks

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,869
I guess you just gonna have to listen to
me talking

24
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,489
trust what I have to say it's much more
entertaining that way anyway that we get

25
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,050
to see me stumble over my words

26
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,739
I'm smart homes are a new breed of homes

27
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:54,039
they haven't a very connected nature and
they also do really cool things like

28
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:58,060
identifying information about you trend
that data and make decisions about you

29
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,129
so explaining a system like that could
be very fruitful

30
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:05,869
nom there's a description that you can
read

31
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:08,919
arm there's a cut on a couple a smart
home projects

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,010
Anna in the world academia right now

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,470
arm to the most well-known are MIT's

34
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,269
house and and Georgia Tech's aware home
and

35
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,430
there they both have web sites on the
last I checked the where home site was

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,440
down for some reason

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,340
an idea alright

38
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,460
info on this presentation compliment the

39
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:34,440
now motivating factors for doing his
presentation was a sitting on my couch

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,180
one night watching the Science Channel

41
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,570
and they were exploring you know home to
the future and they were showing

42
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,810
different things you could do

43
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,980
and this guy got like a text on his
phone and said when the alarm sensors in

44
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,840
his house when of

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,220
so he wanted see what was going on so
you log into

46
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,580
the admin interface and connected to his
home

47
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,870
start looking at a bunch of video games
is house and I started screaming oh my

48
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,460
god this http

49
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,560
you know I was like what are these
people doing in an you know those

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,670
countless other things they were showing
and I just kept jumping off the couch

51
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,370
going oh my god I can't believe they're
gonna sell it to people

52
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,060
and I can't even imagine what's gonna
happen once manufactures actually start

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,460
you know mass-producing this technology
its gonna get a lot worse which is

54
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,360
ash kinda fun okay our team impasse that

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,350
Tom basically that's last slide said I
was honored

56
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,200
arm smartphones are to have typically in
the past they've been focused on luxury

57
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,440
you know I mean not everybody can afford
the clapper right so

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,480
what ended up happening is they started
seen a tremendous use for this

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,770
in assisted living you know with the
elderly or medically disabled

60
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,280
which brings in some more really
interesting aspects when you're talking

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,040
about attacking smart home technology

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,929
you know you can actually be affecting
some is life home

63
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,690
and E okay in the future smart homes

64
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,530
and their components will be a part of
everyone's life and why is that

65
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,620
is because we all love getting owned our

66
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,650
now this is really interesting I wanna
do like in Philly local pictures in here

67
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,790
and I found this picture I want a guy in
a wheelchair to show the disabled in

68
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,130
israel is really funny cuz actually very
first thing that came up in Google

69
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,728
Images was this picture says my son's
hit me

70
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:23,090
says wheelchair-bound man and this is
the 80-year-old man claims that his son

71
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,400
slapped him and tried to push him down a
slope

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,520
and it's come to Austin okay anyway
nevermind

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,560
free it s like the contents of a smart
home

74
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,610
Tom you gonna have some components like
%uh servers

75
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,610
not connected appliances cameras
furniture

76
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,949
jewelry Exeter Exeter tera now many
newer devices

77
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,599
some come with some sort of connected
capabilities even if it's just for

78
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,930
getting updates I mean if your toaster
want a firmware upgrade its gonna have

79
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,090
to connect somehow

80
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,830
mean you know the the I'm sure you you
know he's not gonna be like flashing the

81
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,729
BIOS you gonna hafta

82
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,229
to you lose control of all your points
is so some third party's gonna have to

83
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,949
manage that

84
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:07,330
not interfacing with the smart home
there's many different ways

85
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,139
that smart homes will be interface with
am the phone the web

86
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,389
my wireless in all its you know
capabilities RFID power outlets cap 55

87
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:16,759
yr

88
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,819
and countless interfaces that have even
been developed yet

89
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,539
so that that's a lot of different
interfaces

90
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:27,998
arm smart homes on the flip side
interface with us

91
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:32,569
mom you know technology can not actually
affect the way we feel

92
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,520
and we'll get into that later with the
psychological aspects in actually

93
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,889
hacking a person

94
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,319
which is actually kinda cool to you and
I'm across a NorCal my son

95
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,229
home mood pendants photo albums our
prediction activities

96
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:50,289
antenna prediction content in actually
making decisions

97
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,509
you know what I can see the slide better
over on this side of the screen and you

98
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:56,400
can out there that's really funny

99
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,189
om well if you're yale is rotated around
so everybody can see the back

100
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:05,520
right haha am prediction technologies

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,680
Tom you know what do you want for
breakfast oMG what do you watch on TV

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,219
now this could be cool what you watchin
TV you get your TV and we've already

103
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,210
seen as with like TiVo to start to

104
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,779
make decisions for you right based on
what you watch now what if your friends

105
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,379
get older that you know i mean

106
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,300
my friends come to my house they sit
down and there's like 100 episodes a

107
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,189
Will and Grace on my DVR slide what are
you doing it

108
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,330
you know so our favorite television
shows on

109
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,938
you know whatever food you like the
system's hold a vast amount of data

110
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:37,919
they're gonna have a vast amount to date
on us think a bus like an advertiser's

111
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,008
dream

112
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,729
you know marketing companies dream is to
have all this information exactly what

113
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:45,169
you like to do exactly how you like to
do it

114
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,089
and how many times a day you do it which
now and wants me knowing exactly how

115
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,270
many times a day I do certain activities

116
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,539
but my house would know and that was
scary

117
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,869
and it's done to context-aware computing
in we'll get into that man

118
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,830
arm yeah I'm kinda comp so

119
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,550
so what does all this stored predictable
information about us me

120
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,710
not that we're gonna have to read our
usage agreements very close with third

121
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,619
parties

122
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:13,999
when we start buying this technology we
have to make sure we read the fine print

123
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:17,379
not say you allow us to take all this
information is sent

124
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,800
rate back to us so we can use it against
you later

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,339
home we're gonna have to be mindful on
the exploitation of the systems in the

126
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,180
different ways the system's be
vulnerable

127
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,449
and that information can be extracted
now

128
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,930
in our personal pronto archives can
actually be ripped off and mass when I'm

129
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,990
scared

130
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,919
okay context-aware computing on
context-aware computing

131
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,448
involves you know sensors in logic in
order to analyze movement activities are

132
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,139
viewing this is done through sensors
placed

133
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:50,539
all through your house mean on you know
on sugar containers on drawers

134
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,139
on the walls on light outlets on this

135
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,779
and a simple this is an extremely
oversimplified example

136
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,259
but just to give you an idea when I mean
say there's two people that live in a

137
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:01,930
house

138
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,599
you know Allison bomb when bob walks
into a room

139
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
rate before you know walking into that
room the lights

140
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,599
come on with a red t because the house
knows that bob is about to walk in the

141
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:13,919
room

142
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,099
and Amitabh green light so they're gonna
turn on lights red but when Alice watch

143
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:18,800
in the room

144
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,869
she hates red lights her lodging action
overrides the other logic and when she

145
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,789
walks into the room let's turn angry

146
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:29,229
really simple example and so I have a
bunch pictures that you probably won't

147
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,789
know you pricey those fairly well

148
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:34,979
in in this is this is from MIT's house
and they call those little

149
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,029
the little chips the column mites which
is actually kinda cool

150
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,219
MIT ES see get a joke and all the
sensors

151
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,710
are on be no sugar flour there on India

152
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,480
the the light outlets there on the
drawers with the silverware is

153
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,710
and that information is being back to a
central computer

154
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,290
and it has a tendency to learn things
about you and you can actually there's

155
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,730
actually a picture on not

156
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,230
MIT's house and where they have a PDA
and appointing at different things in

157
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,230
the PDA knows

158
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,660
that's a fork you know that's a spoon
that a knife it actually learns

159
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,540
about your activities in about the
physical items in your environment

160
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,519
okay now we can get to some other fun
stuff impacts upon abilities right

161
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,389
think about the impact on your computer
being compromised that's pretty bad

162
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:23,730
you know you you may have password so
Security numbers bank accounts credit

163
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,170
cards

164
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,199
tax turned prime browsing activities

165
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,790
and how stupid your screen name is I
mean people actually can learn that

166
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,899
about you by

167
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:35,120
you know exploiting your computer system
nothing about the

168
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,130
on the impacts upon abilities in your
home

169
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,589
so you could actually have internal
video cameras which to me is just

170
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:44,759
utterly scary I don't know why anybody
would be ok im inside her home

171
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,220
I'm pair Nadine a I'm paranoid enough to
put money outside my house

172
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,949
but yeah it i cant used to select
wireless cameras why would anybody for

173
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:55,370
wireless cameras on the inside her home

174
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,769
yes porn driving

175
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:04,709
okay nom internal video cameras arm and
disarm alarm such change prescription

176
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:05,110
use

177
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,220
what you like and you DVR temperature
your house which can actually really

178
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,329
funny world we live in Florida Minister
P

179
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:14,670
sometime mom temperature you liking
house mischief

180
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,139
with not connected appliances are you to
have its location technologies

181
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,740
and dont know if your kids are home
which is always fun to scare people with

182
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,379
their kids

183
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:26,250
mean advertising companies do not I'm
the president won election with that you

184
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,829
know all that stuff

185
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:35,290
okay attack vectors for a smart home
very cool multiple attacks actors

186
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,709
you have %um people in the home
connected appliances

187
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:41,899
outlets picture frames which is very
cool

188
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,350
and you know and the actual medium you
have no wireless

189
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,190
telephone lines not count 55 yr

190
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,089
down so so we know that these homes are
gonna have to have some sort of

191
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,040
administration interface

192
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,399
have to have some kind administration
interface so most likely

193
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,560
they're gonna be have issues with
regular admin interface is that we

194
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,069
already have whether it be programming
logic

195
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:13,180
passwords tokens but plain text plain
text authentication which probably won't

196
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,389
I mean some some manufacturers are
actually smarting up a little bit so

197
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,399
this may not be as much of an issue when
they start rolling to sell

198
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,620
but they may have some weird backward
compatibility that actually has HTTP

199
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,490
built into it

200
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,350
in eighty people accidentally just use
that interface versus an HTTPS interface

201
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,040
our man in the middle attacks telephone
you know you can bring war dialing back

202
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,469
am Wireless were driving and basically
and interfaces will be known to an

203
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,639
attacker had a time

204
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,259
so is if the manufacture tries to you
know avi skate the

205
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,509
admin interface say by switching the
port you know

206
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:49,600
like nobody would ever figure out that
they switched the report from

207
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,370
82 you know 1337 or something like that
they would never figure that out

208
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,639
even though they publish it information
how you have to connect to it

209
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,990
cells everybody's going to know ahead of
time if you're specifically targeting an

210
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,670
attack in a smart home

211
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,899
you already have an information so you
won't even bother going looking

212
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,529
anywhere else have you know exactly
where the information is to begin with

213
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,350
now third party issues these

214
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,069
future smart homes on most likely will
have

215
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,790
third-party interfaces because people
are too stupid to you

216
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,230
run their own stuff so you can have this
wonderful third-party

217
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,209
that to next year your smart home for
the monitoring operation

218
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,970
administration om and it all depends on
the technologies marketed maintain

219
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,920
am you know mostly most likely people
will meet it

220
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,709
be connected to a third party even if
it's just for updates have some kind

221
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:43,709
and we all know that that our computers
never send information that we don't

222
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,029
know about back 2 a.m.

223
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:49,350
you know a big company starts with an M
right K

224
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,139
and that be really funny have Windows
Genuine Advantage on your home

225
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,350
so then they disable your updates you
get on like all over the place because

226
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,490
you had like

227
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,480
pirated copies XP running your own be
really funny

228
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,889
there's a big potential for misuse and
exploitation by third parties just like

229
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:05,959
any third party

230
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,800
you know I'm always scared like that the
alarm on my house doesn't have a two-way

231
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,430
communicator which i think is really
funny because I know some of the people

232
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,579
that work it like ATT and safe touch in
all these other companies

233
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:20,899
and you know in the middle the night its
you know there's nothing else to do

234
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:23,910
you know I can just see some may go in
useless in this one

235
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,620
was this is one oh man oh man was he
listened to your own business when you

236
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,209
need

237
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,889
into people's grumpy everything else so

238
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,720
you know the in this technology

239
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,660
can definitely be outsourced so now you
have you know people in another country

240
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,170
listening to you have sex or watching
your video cameras are doing

241
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,689
you know anything you know the prior
relatively unskilled

242
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:49,670
envies they have a vast amount of
information about people at their

243
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,649
fingertips

244
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,759
that could be very easy to sell

245
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,949
nom week protections in place for admin
user lockout

246
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:04,709
on you know it it just seems that all
the technology changes stupidity is

247
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:05,410
timeless

248
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,980
people are gonna forget things I mean
I'm sure the first the first caveman

249
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,730
that invented the stone will was like

250
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,649
I am you he saw the vision this will
change the world there's like four

251
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,310
hundred other came a stand around on

252
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,370
I don't get it home you know

253
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,740
no lockouts could mean you know
automated attacks

254
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,550
and I can just see people getting pissed
off after like it i three lockout

255
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,970
in a time period and if you're talking
about like nom you know medical

256
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,660
issues or something involving health you
wouldn't be able to lock people out

257
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,749
he'd kill somebody on third-party

258
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:41,879
not manufacture backdoor counts
manufactures again and

259
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:45,060
have ways to get any update their gonna
have accounts on the system

260
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,079
he also has a third party in support
accounts soon

261
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,379
you know now you have all these other
people that can connect your home and

262
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:55,850
get into your account and also you know
if the if an attacker exploits when he's

263
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,889
back door counter

264
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:01,740
third-party account they have the same
access to the system is a UN

265
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,209
on people you know still choose you know
we pins and passwords

266
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,670
phishing attacks on your house good
start to happen

267
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,990
depending on I'm when people start
realizing

268
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,230
you know how valuable this information
really is and how much is worth

269
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,249
Tom home loggins could be you know the
keys to the castle

270
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:25,370
allowing an attacker to view thing went
on to someone steal personal information

271
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,709
and voyeurism which is the only one we
agree with antenna

272
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:32,470
access to technology is gonna be done
through mobile devices so you have PDA's

273
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,339
laptops cellphones

274
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:38,029
and it if you lose one of those we all
know that everybody

275
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,529
it can be recovered right because
everybody walks their PDA the phone

276
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,740
whatever so nobody would ever be able to
you

277
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,060
analyze that PDA your smartphone in get
anything of an

278
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,480
and most likely people will store the
passwords are he's comin comin

279
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,670
device itself she won't even have to
attack you already have the information

280
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,759
these smart homes are also gonna have
servers and operating systems

281
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,009
so the same vulnerabilities that affect
you know

282
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:09,040
the Windows box at work you know is also
in effect

283
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,559
you know the Windows box in a smart home
on

284
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,969
so what OS are they gonna be using i
think im using Microsoft 1x

285
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,079
Cisco on in all these illnesses have
never had security problems right

286
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,870
okay on from from an OS level

287
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,899
on I'm repeating myself you're not
looking slide sorry

288
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:30,160
on in a course you have now where worms

289
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,670
spyware getting on year your home nasty
snarky

290
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,569
so exploiting the medium in in llegas
and apologizes

291
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:41,540
there's so many slides were trying to go
through a mall in were we're trying to

292
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,649
put some the most interesting stuff

293
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,259
appear so exploiting the medium the
physical medium you know

294
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:51,649
there's definitely multiple mediums
communicating over

295
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:55,269
your multiple protocols over multiple
medium so you have wireless fiber

296
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,990
collect power lines cafe mixer center
center

297
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,490
on all these mediums can beat after just
connected to you

298
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,980
I'm from protocol perspective it looks
like one network me TCPIP doesn't

299
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,410
really care what it communicates over so
you're in a mean you're

300
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,180
your toaster campaign your computer your
toaster can be plugged into a power

301
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,900
outlet near computer plugged into your
cat five lines in your house

302
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,610
to home this means that the lowest
hanging fruit can be explained from

303
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,910
medium standpoint

304
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,030
there are there are couple mediums
actually extend beyond your house

305
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,090
so would it wouldn't even require you to
be in the home to exploit them

306
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,419
and that's our wireless in the OP mom

307
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,740
just we're not gonna go on wireless I
mean that

308
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,570
while a securities obviously been beaten
into the ground so we show mountains

309
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,919
you know Wireless security get arm

310
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,730
GOP on the other hand allows Ethernet
communication is basically over your

311
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,450
household power lines

312
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,800
and this is very cool technology you
know

313
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,440
just thinking about it you're like okay
you know Ethernet over power

314
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,650
Tom you know how far does that girl

315
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,920
in I actually have some these devices
and I had him you know plugged into my

316
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,760
house and

317
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,250
I was like running around my house
inside in of course I was

318
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,750
getting a great paying on everything and
then I went outside and started hitting

319
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,010
up the outlets on the outside my house

320
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,120
and had a great paying and then I was
going to my neighbor's house

321
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,530
and come to find out we're still doing
research into finding out just how far

322
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,040
that signal goes

323
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,370
and down think about you connected
technologies like this

324
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,610
in like a skyscraper I mean we're gonna
our skyscraper in a

325
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,880
I can't even imagine how far that that
would travel through the electoral

326
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,420
system so you can actually get

327
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,590
office next to you you know and company
that you're trying to

328
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,980
you know perform espionage on in
actually possibly get into their local

329
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,680
network if they had some this technology

330
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,840
I was nasty get

331
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,220
when as far as transform

332
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:59,220
for the transformer

333
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:05,930
plug at the bottom is really

334
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,020
yes so

335
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,780
fingerprinting a home that's very cool

336
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,920
home the this takes on a whole new on

337
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,330
approach when you're talking about ipv6
so if you have

338
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,879
every you know if your toaster your
fridge

339
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,800
everything as a globally routable ipv6
address it would be possible to

340
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,460
fingerprint home

341
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,920
so now you're talking about you could be
giving you know I a thief

342
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,650
and pretty good idea of you know your
your Plasma TV

343
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,680
I hear you what kinda fried you have
farm

344
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,240
all this information I can foreseeing
the future if his

345
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,200
technology starts rolling out becoming
widely accepted you actually have

346
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,730
databases fingerprint databases that
will you know tell you all this

347
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,850
you know probably toaster you may even
be built in and map

348
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:57,510
you know toaster version 2 nom you nor
our fridge version 1

349
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,950
outdated you know explain and now be
really fun easier to manage my project

350
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,450
was like and you know actually built in
for fridge

351
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,400
shell yes

352
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,990
arm vulnerabilities don't just have to
be buffer overflows companies are really

353
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,880
good at creating their own

354
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,240
vulnerabilities due process so you have
process vulnerabilities which

355
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,210
are can be exploited by taking advantage
in the way they do things whether

356
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,800
you know it's a om a vulnerability in an
authorization and more vulnerability and

357
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,690
authentication arm see here because

358
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,870
on yeah okay process when I really think
adventure steps in the process that are

359
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,530
not properly checked on

360
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,629
because they're not fun ahead a time
because the manufactures didn't care at

361
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,210
the time

362
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,320
not only do you want to do sell you
stuff on because they don't know how to

363
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,909
stop it

364
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,470
and wanted to make money anyway and
usually an authorization issue and

365
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,410
stupid picture frame example

366
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,770
I was will say that out loud the at my
example that would be say you have

367
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,000
a picture frame technology we can send
pictures to

368
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,930
not gramm and did the technology works
on

369
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,510
he creates an email address for itself
and all you have to do to send a picture

370
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,240
to

371
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,280
did picture frame is just email the
picture to it well

372
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,500
you know without any authorization
authentication you could send whatever

373
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,010
picture you want to do to the picture
for me

374
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,410
it's going to take manufactures a while
to get it right arm

375
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,480
Google hacking the home is possible on
in be really interesting to see once

376
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,100
again once this technology

377
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,110
gets widely accepted if you know
Google's gonna spider your homie

378
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,520
find different interfaces on on search
technologies

379
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,820
some admin your faces user interfaces
arm can use for fingerprints

380
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,710
be in the system an course you robots
not textile save you every time I

381
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,850
own video services down these video
services are usually marketed as safety

382
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,070
and I got this of a cent no vision

383
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,510
in what's really funny is is the it
doesn't it's really hard to see but

384
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,150
I circled in red because our he says
know if kids are home

385
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,180
it doesn't say no if your kids are home
it is is no if kids are home and I

386
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,670
wonder if their marketing this depend if
I'll see

387
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,280
make and in I didn't realize it at the
time but there's is it there's a guy

388
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,080
laying on the floor and it says feel
secure with panic services

389
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,659
and what what the hell is that but thats
Sentinel vision dot com

390
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,760
and there that's their marketing
internal video cameras

391
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,240
for your home and I'm sure they're
secure an almost thinking about buying

392
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,960
the services to find out

393
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,170
you know what's going on with it and how
its access but I know it's remotely

394
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,090
accessible now electronic portrait

395
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,610
this is going to be very very very fine
in steven is actually marketing this

396
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,580
already antenna you know the comp an
additional family quarters

397
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,429
they're connected Porter technologies
are you can remotely send pictures

398
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,700
on wouldn't it be funny for grammy wake
up one morning with goats in tub girl

399
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,190
on oliver picture frames in our house

400
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,330
that's what i foresee happening Tom in
the logical move is to make these things

401
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,149
Wireless

402
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,620
because people don't want wires running
all over the walls right so

403
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,300
eventually they can make the sink
Wireless most likely not to be protected

404
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,940
in a grandma gets go see in tub girl all
over her walls

405
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,560
UK in she doesn't change in case she
doesn't know how

406
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:20,419
and that be funny she had a church
meeting that morning it's like

407
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,420
when you bring medical systems into the
picture do some life-threatening

408
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,350
consequences

409
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,580
because medical systems can be remotely
monitored remotely exploitable

410
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,770
and what about a DOS to be in a dialysis
machine

411
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,150
I mean it's really not funny cuz it
would kill somebody

412
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,270
but thats the technology that they're
pushing

413
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,220
978 what is it accidentally happens what
a fun you know what a phone a warm is

414
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,330
just scan in the crap and everything in
it scans a dialysis machine or something

415
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,899
many good actually kill somebody not
even do it so then guarantee they trying

416
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,180
to crucify whoever wrote the virus

417
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:56,150
not medicine cabinets to be really funny
to replace grandpa's heart medication

418
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,420
with the agra

419
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,850
he's wonder why you know each as a
possible pressure something

420
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,260
om in in it not even just the attacks
but what about a malfunction a

421
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:11,570
on the medical system because a malware
you know viruses things like that

422
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:16,270
your toaster just blue screened

423
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,670
and gesture pendants these are really
cool these are

424
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,810
are wearable jewelry that you can
actually do different things with

425
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:27,260
so you point added devices and adjust
your PIN is a good morning and he turns

426
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,070
on the TV

427
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,919
so you can actually you know break dance
in point and do different things

428
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,570
well what about false positives are
false negatives

429
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,770
I mean are you can it might turn off
your free agent like any

430
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,530
you know false negatives in the
assumption about this technology

431
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,520
is that people are going to use it the
way it's intended I can foresee with I

432
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,560
would use agent jester penny for

433
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,940
gesture pendant for and Tom you know we
all know this worked real well in the

434
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,970
past like you know you're only supposed
to do things for their intended use

435
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,110
and %ah someone is gonna have sex with
one of these on it is to be flying all

436
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,190
over the place

437
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,640
and you know who knows what's gonna turn
on turn off the shades open up

438
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,080
be very funny somebody has to video tape
and put it on you

439
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,780
on this is one from Georgia Tech's where
home got a bunch a little cameras and

440
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:18,930
Andy you you didn't want to see anyway

441
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,970
there it is yes you can so you can see
he's a

442
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:26,480
pointing at something in his getaway
Lannisters a dolphin assured

443
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,860
I'm memory aids

444
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,070
memory aids are devices that you know
help grandma remember she took her

445
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,600
medication and/or help you remember your
shopping Lannister

446
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,530
things like that so nom

447
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,030
it enhances your long-term memory I'm
attacking these could lead to some

448
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,879
interesting results although most it
would be for mischief I mean

449
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,620
you know unless you're trying to track
you know what people were trying to

450
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,320
remember

451
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,740
which I guess could have some some
marginal value but

452
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,440
you know making some think they did
something they didn't take medication

453
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,300
now missing messing up a recipe would be
really funny

454
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,740
I can remember the men in their N in
creating confusing memories

455
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,340
antenna also replacing icons have
tylenol tub girl

456
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,530
you know be funny on but the larger
picture is

457
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,260
memories and used its lost so

458
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,379
in essence you could kind to say that
these the memory technologies are

459
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,630
actually replacing

460
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,260
you know your ability to remember
yourself is part of remembering in using

461
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,030
your brain is with

462
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,840
you know they did actually in research
that said you know the more you use it

463
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,400
you know the more you you you keep it so
that's why doctors researchers and

464
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,990
everybody

465
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,120
typically don't have the memory issues
later on in life that some other people

466
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,150
do

467
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,420
I'm hacking your mood on there's a lot
of technology going into place that

468
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,290
actually

469
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,639
finds out your mood sounds like ok am
upset okay and you know

470
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,910
I didn't realize I was upset you know
sorry but your house will tell you

471
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,140
you're upset and maybe put

472
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,890
my changes let me know the walls or
something to suit your mood

473
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,470
well you can actually attack that
technology make people think they were

474
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,240
saddened like him I don't remember be

475
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,910
I don't think I'm sad I just laugh in a
minute ago you know so that that could

476
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,450
be

477
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:09,270
interesting and also if people know that
that d when you're angry things turn red

478
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,650
and the come over to your house is like
a home billy ol shit I'm out here you

479
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,080
know

480
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,790
so you can actually get other people to
think you're in a certain mood as well

481
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:20,520
and this is %uh that's what I call on
the pending attack

482
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,160
I'm RFID implants there isn't a good
presentation on that

483
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,610
on and I'm music Friday antenna

484
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,420
it was pretty good I i'm still would
never get one I think for one the

485
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,310
technologies to New and then all the

486
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,450
the virus jumping in everything else
that they're doing she now for me

487
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,070
and now the baja club in Barcelona uses
microchip technology

488
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,010
so that the so that they know when your
VIP members walk in and they just put

489
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,910
drinks honor

490
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,450
tabby on that date they cloned in 20
implants

491
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,200
on Friday said be really fun to walk in
the club yes skinny

492
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,900
you know I'm gonna in a runoff with
drinks

493
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,850
GPS GPS implants %ah this is also

494
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,290
for for small this is marketed at your
kids to fear tactics

495
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:08,840
on this scare tactics employees will and
you can't blame me scare tactics worked

496
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,850
for president and it worked for Hitler
cell

497
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,160
me wanna use in the marketing so

498
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,360
specifically aimed at your kids and the
bigger picture is

499
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,630
is what what is the real issue that
you're looking at what you trying to

500
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,710
protect against it dude is actually

501
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,690
a greater chance risk by doing GPS
implants

502
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,670
in there are something actually
happening to your kids people to analyze

503
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,790
the risks well enough

504
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:35,379
when when me and taking these things
into account arm

505
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,750
in whatever happened it is raising your
kids

506
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,810
on but the in like I said the larger
picture the bigger risk is the fact that

507
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,879
you know most likely it's gonna be kids
that get these so now you just let

508
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,100
everybody know

509
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:56,100
on you know whether it's through third
party or whatever where kids are

510
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,429
be at work yeah re and

511
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,470
gun to pass it others basically was
misusing exploitation that technology

512
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,850
arm I R in forensics also gets really
interesting with

513
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,340
connected technologies I mean the worm
were making assumptions that

514
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,430
you know the technology's going long
properly you know when also most likely

515
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,360
she's going on

516
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,330
you know critical system errors or
something like that because they don't

517
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,300
want to use up

518
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,670
valuable memory in these technologies

519
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,030
be really funny too like do friends
exxon toaster now

520
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,899
or so many owns a toaster and then ends
up startin' to own different companies

521
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,510
with it not be really funny to trace it
back in its like oh my god you're

522
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,190
toasters attacking the world

523
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,200
your toaster attack China

524
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,200
om there's some psychological issues
with technology

525
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,420
his anytime a technological device comes
on the market yet you kids

526
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,210
people try to use that instead of
raising their kids you know whether it's

527
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,600
tracking them a final where they are or

528
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,410
or are you know just basically putting
them on lockdown I have a true story

529
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,090
about this

530
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,480
which is not very long but I what I grew
up with this girl who was a strict

531
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,180
Bethel Baptist she couldn't even wear
pants for crisis

532
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,580
had to wear you know the school lots kar
take things she hated him whenever

533
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,389
she grew up to be the biggest slut on
the planet I think she had sex with

534
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,010
everybody's cool tough for me

535
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,420
just my luck and you know its ok so if
you push

536
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,110
people too hard one way it always comes
back way worse

537
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,380
home she's getting I and

538
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,380
arm possible rejection so with
technology

539
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,490
maybe this technology is you know too
intrusive

540
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,830
and people don't want it the most likely
that's not the case people were eating

541
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,040
up I mean look at what happened with
Paris Hilton psychic there's this whole

542
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,100
thing or her psychic not only in

543
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,860
in that was the the way everybody
thought it happened so I was like oh

544
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,860
shit

545
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,500
the mall as a psychic money self we love
to get owned

546
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,710
um we will focus forego our privacy
because she's cool

547
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,820
and guess what vendors lie you know on
that

548
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,730
a I laugh at all these new commercials
are coming up like city identity theft

549
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,590
solutions

550
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,870
like they have this disease blonde if
you'd like to get his password online I

551
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,440
mean

552
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,720
that doesn't happen or the or the two
mom the to redneck guys who bought like

553
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,170
motorcycles with some dudes account I
mean come on that's not realistic

554
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:15,930
and another one is AT&T's new security
solutions they have to have this

555
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,630
person walking around in Nike you know
on-scene password in Germany and doing

556
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,520
missing

557
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,810
I can see a six-year in Chinese you know
secure I'd tell you what

558
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,610
if you believe that you better learn to
say douche bag in a couple those

559
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,920
languages because that's what you're
gonna be

560
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,700
I'm okay smart cars not just a little
bit about markers because we're

561
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,920
replace it I I have no idea how many
slides we went through already

562
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,980
on but smart cars on

563
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,460
connect back to the home so you can do
you know seeking

564
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,800
check your house have your garage door
mom mark Compton open garage door

565
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,150
we we have the technology now and it
hasn't been you know to admit

566
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,500
you know the turning of your long arms
amino starting out on me all that senior

567
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,280
on the scene

568
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,350
all that um and its tracked by a

569
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,900
you know you have GPS cue track to law
enforcement third parties

570
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,000
com and largely because the the force
the technology down your throat by

571
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,200
holding you kids have you had any non
star is best at that

572
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,520
you don't care about my feelings you

573
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,080
ok it wasn't funny sinatra please arm
there there's a

574
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,100
Tom there's a company an Australian its
marketing this technology

575
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:29,800
mom so let's look at it you know what
happens to me steal your car

576
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,050
you know now now near you know connected
back to your home in

577
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,290
in the company said it going the company
said that

578
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:40,620
you know if someone steals your car is
not it is no problem with that because

579
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,230
they can get in your home technologies
that's because people always look out

580
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,230
like they should

581
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,110
now and there's always there's no way
anybody would ever program their home

582
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,780
address into the GPS that they have no
car right

583
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,500
on people would want to customize any
other features to suit their needs

584
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,590
and on also people always use devices
for their intended purpose

585
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:05,000
so most likely have to do is open the
glove box month for the pain

586
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,530
arm in a green biometrics into cars is
stupid I mean is your car more valuable

587
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,350
than a body part

588
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,470
I mean every can see is coming the car
more valuable than a by Park

589
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,790
no to a crackhead yes so if you
integrate yourself into a car

590
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:23,629
you increase the the chances are having
to include yourself in a carjacking

591
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,270
either you or a body part is gonna have
to be included as carjacking

592
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,290
car theft is not gonna stop because on
the

593
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:34,310
was a yeah I know that that's why I said
above the warning everybody can see it

594
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,120
coming

595
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,270
um so that's very bad I mean a to me

596
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,500
a key works just fine I'm get into the
car and if somebody hold me up a mic

597
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,740
take a shit ton of a ban on

598
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,130
okay so I now we're gonna get into a or
more about vehicle tracking here

599
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:57,110
arm thats let's discuss ons are a little
bit here

600
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,810
our question disaster know where I am
all the time

601
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,080
no i answer does not continuously or

603

604
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,339
plus I don't want them knowing where
where I go from a good hookers

605
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,349
now there's word that they're using
TaqMan a

606
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:23,569
thats exigent medical workup

607
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:26,699
sorry no college education so are
require

608
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,060
requiring immediate action or remedy and
other words

609
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,540
anytime OnStar feels it necessary know
when three-letter organization hams know

610
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:41,540
where the hell you are

611
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:51,829
to

612
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:57,160
26 pretty pleased

613
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,949
the value tent staked is its total

614
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:04,459
0 biometrics and you know so

615
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:08,779
if they're being counted as the RI

616
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:12,249
thank you now I can lower my voice

617
00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:16,699
being used on me biometrics are being
touted as the be all end all security

618
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:17,239
device

619
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:20,839
and there the really not

620
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:24,058
mica said they're not it's not see her
in in we're gonna go in team

621
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,209
to more of a rant on this and give you
some examples but on

622
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:31,469
a Gaga names and bony did a presentation
at last year's de con

623
00:42:31,469 --> 00:42:34,729
and if you go out there you can download
the presentation for free and it's a

624
00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:36,719
very good overview love

625
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,769
you know the technology different attack
points

626
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:46,769
you know and he explains a lot better
than I could other protected resource

627
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:51,430
has to be mom you know can be more
valuable than a limb

628
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,618
it it actually ties back into the whole
rant about the cars

629
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:59,199
now if if it's a fingerprint that's
required to get into a building

630
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,859
you know some the tops of your finger
you kinda screwed if

631
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:09,279
okay I did put in their Zamboni's def
country stations going to it silent you

632
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:11,190
step there a lot you can give us
afterwards

633
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,229
okay identity theft which it's basically
fraud according to Bruce Schneier

634
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:19,749
arm ask Mrs Catherine phone exploits it
via

635
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:22,959
bank account fraud Pay Pal Amazon are

636
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:26,538
I'm sure you'll have seen several
fishing letters

637
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:30,019
and I the pretty much all social
engineering attacks

638
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:33,619
arm or stolen data more if you I

639
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:37,279
the getting better at it reason better
English scams

640
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:42,519
scam sites look much more official
sometimes even have valid SSL certs

641
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,029
and I the obscure obfuscate the URL's

642
00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:49,459
any veterans in the house

643
00:43:49,459 --> 00:43:52,979
you have to raise your hand just think
about it did you get one of these

644
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:53,519
letters

645
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,999
are about you but I'm pissed

646
00:43:56,999 --> 00:44:03,949
okay so we went through and did a little

647
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:08,509
om experiment to figure out how much how
much space

648
00:44:08,509 --> 00:44:12,180
26 half-a-million record database would
take up

649
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,288
and I'm thank the gods for bastards
honest

650
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:18,819
if arm

651
00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:21,829
ended up in about 40 gigabytes because i
was thinkin that

652
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:25,759
maybe their mainframe got hacked in
their issues in this laptop thing as an

653
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:26,430
excuse

654
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:31,430
well not necessarily mom came out to be
about 40 gigs

655
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:37,808
pretty easily fits on external drive but
they recovered the sup

656
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:44,809
yeah after two fucking months who knows
really what happened to arm

657
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:48,339
it's damn easy man hard drive read-only
on

658
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:52,979
this is a policy issue the contractor
had written permission to take that data

659
00:44:52,979 --> 00:44:57,930
at the building yes since 2002

660
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:03,160
yes

661
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,319
we think they put a GPS device on the
laptop to track

662
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,109
yes arm

663
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:15,269
president ass munch also has been very
nice

664
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:19,309
to deny 160 million dollars to protect
our veterans

665
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:24,729
despite the fact that the store so
useless war and causes war veterans

666
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:29,069
on

667
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:34,529
you can't control your personal data in
pieces at record stones MasterCard said

668
00:45:34,529 --> 00:45:35,459
record stone

669
00:45:35,459 --> 00:45:39,009
State Oregon eccentric said Rep

670
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:43,599
on even places you've never done
business with Hills ChoicePoint

671
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,349
and why did they sell a hundred and
sixty thousand records to identity

672
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,989
thieves

673
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:52,539
because they want to make money its near
the only ones paying

674
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:55,539
on so what happens when that

675
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:59,449
database contains the informers for your
smart house you're smart car get stolen

676
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:04,119
will on now again they have full access
your vehicle

677
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:09,429
and your home okay and we made it just
in time for questions to know

678
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:13,329
hopefully we have some interesting
questions that we can answer

679
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:16,729
is the best kind okay thank you

680
00:46:16,729 --> 00:46:21,589
no no just getting for I'll for

681
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:26,219
its yeah knob its hacker pimps dot com
force last doc study shemale

682
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:31,179
this is real easy it's not up yet so

683
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:35,819
yeah he has to go back to it he's
hungover and he's not listening

684
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:41,329
not go back to what the all the slide to

685
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:45,660
good yes found while looking at I guess
Spiers devices

686
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:50,808
interfaces cetera you know much like I
guess like wifi routers

687
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:54,369
that they have security features but
that they're not enabled by default

688
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:54,999
that's correct

689
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:58,440
even even a little the HomePlug devices
it says I

690
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,940
its it's got a 56 p as encryption and
there's like a little key on the back in

691
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,380
the day

692
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,579
guess but nobody ever using plugin ran
into the wall and him communicate with

693
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:07,679
your printer or

694
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:13,619
or anything else nice

695
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:19,959
we are damn good we only had one
question

696
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:21,769
and I hope you all enjoyed it thank you
thanks
