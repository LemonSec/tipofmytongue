world

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,500

and I'm gonna ask you to find

19
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:33,789
every ebook in the world that you can

and send it to us and if you have
trouble finding us

21
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,770
you not real hackers I'm heart at PGL EF
.org

22
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,649
and he's GV newbie yet PDF tower

23
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,609

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

25
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,399
for you okay

26
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,520
now what we want to do is giveaway

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,399
as many e-books to as many people as
possible that's that's the whole game

28
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,449
okay

29
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,299
and I'm asking you to help because we
have just grown

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,610
so far out of proportion will drive you
crazy I mean

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,900
use like him area and i cant talking
point at the same time

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,220
on this is the manger idea

33
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,410
I'm hopin

34
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,060
that you can think so far outside the
box in making this go

35
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,380
that everything we ever did before we
look really small

36
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,160
so far we've given away about one and a
third trillion he walks

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,510
and I want to make that mark tiny

38
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,700
really really time Sao

39
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:56,320
that's the goal almost did you know that
there wasn't much in the way literacy

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,900
before Johan Hedberg the printing press
effect

41
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,860
the average book before gutenberg cost
as much as the average family farm

42
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,480
and the literacy rate was probably

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,649
less than one percent what somebody
wanted information to get out they put a

44
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,990
poster up someplace

45
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,740
and the one person in the village you
could read

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,590
read it everybody there was a general
way that things went

47
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,780
in the next 50 years

48
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,530
after the invention of the gutenberg
printing press more books were printed

49
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,800
then in all the previous history in the
world I'm hopin

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,030
that in the next 50 years more evokes

51
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,130
will be created then they were ever
books in the whole previous history in

52
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,730
the world these are mission statements

53
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,900
the pretty simple pretty straightforward
and

54
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,370
most important part is you I'm hoping
you can help me find

55
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,530
all the books that have been hidden away

56
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,060
lost different sites that went down if
you come through alexei dot com and find

57
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,960
someone to the old backups or anything
like that anybody as backups

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,170
we don't mind we would rather get a
dozen

59
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:15,240
versions of the same book did not get
one some don't worry about sending this

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,850
stuff that you think we already have

61
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,880
we've

62
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
created so far about 20,000 e-books our
own

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,030
and we've had another 80,000 or so
donated to us

64
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,060
from over a hundred other people
collections around the world at this

65
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,180
very moment

66
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,250
we're celebrating the 35th anniversary

67
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,250
very first step in making electronic
books

68
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,130
which was this month in 1971

69
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,270
first time I ever heard there was such a
thing as the Internet

70
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,719
and I said let's put something on it
that won't go away

71
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
wanna put something on it that would
still be there ten years

72
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
hundred years later and I didn't know I
was dyslexic at the time

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,970
but I knew the program he was really
hard and

74
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,150
is really hard if you can't tell the
difference between a common a semi-colon

75
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,860
it and I had nightmares in Fortran

76
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,310
so I decided rather than try to write
some program that would stick around for

77
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,389
a while

78
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,290
that I should put something up there
that everybody a general interest idea

79
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,060
that everybody would want and as luck
would have it

80
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,180
that for the July on the way back to the
computer lab I stop for some munchies

81
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,660
and they threw in one of those folk
parchment Declaration of Independence

82
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,350
copies they handed out

83
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,410
back around the bicentennial and when I

84
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,660
dumped all my junk out on the floor that
popped out

85
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,220
and the light bulb went on over my head
literally showed just hardly lucky

86
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,660
anybody whoever says they did a project
like this

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,270
and wasn't really lucky I would be
suspicious if

88
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,700
I could never have done this without all
lot model lock in a lot a lot of people

89
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,889
helping me

90
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,740
including RPG lief CEO Greg Dulli

91
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,230
come on

92
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,820
me he does so much of the stuff that I
could never do

93
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,240
it I'm a I'm a see the pants kinda guy

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,699
yeah I just think up wild ideas and
pushing pushing pushing pushing trying

95
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,530
to get the snowfall over the edge

96
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,540
to wear start to pile that that's my

97
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,110
strength okay now

98
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,470
i'm suppose to mention that we're gonna
be given away

99
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,490
millions the books right now

100
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,830
such as people gonna be walking around
handing out DVD's and they're going to

101
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,530
be some back at the table

102
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,990
and if you collect both DVD easily have

103
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,990
you'll have about as many books as the
average public library

104
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,849
we also have some DVD images online

105
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,989
that we're hoping that people like you
well take a bonus round on

106
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:07,109
we have filled them up two-thirds away
to 20,000 books

107
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:11,159
and left a blank spot for 10,000 that
you choose

108
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:16,029
we want you to take these fill in stuff
given to your friends have them fill in

109
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:16,619
stuff

110
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:20,669
we want to go everywhere go we've place
we'd like to get in from two yards of

111
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:21,359
waco

112
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:25,519
in Australia and back from anywhere that
you can find books that may or may not

113
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,859
be the interest anybody

114
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:31,739
we want to get everything and so what
we're getting handing these out that are

115
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:32,099
on

116
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,969
if you put on a rerun will desk you can
just keep adding on to a woman when you

117
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:38,639
get it filled up to where you think you
going to be pretty much done

118
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,939
leases make me a copy and send it to me
or put it someplace where I can download

119
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:42,379
it

120
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,919
let me tell you about when they were
giving out so we have

121
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,619
I think enough for everyone is here we
don't have enough you go

122
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,479
good work dork slash CD project is a
form to fill out

123
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,589
and we'll send a free DVD

124
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:00,669
anywhere in the world poses paid we are
able to afford this because people

125
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,229
that got them sometimes goes back five
or 10 bucks to help us get out a few

126
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:04,619
more

127
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:09,549
the one that you're getting we just made
for this conference 17,500 books on it

128
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:11,089
is nearly full this one

129
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:14,259
on it's got a lot of HTML scotsman audio
stuff

130
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,319
it may not be sold this one

131
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,419
it has copyrighted I materials on it
donated to

132
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,649
to us so unlike some other ones he sees
resold on

133
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,839
UK because I've public domain and stuff
like that this one

134
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:30,139
I may not be sold we consider that to be
a good thing so up

135
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:34,610
what it says though is give me away so
make copies get the I so

136
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,219
II email me if you can find a good for
the I so up online

137
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,459
later on today ice about you know
four-point 3

138
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,879
gag and I enjoy it copy it pass it on

139
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,870
and share file share the whole thing
make your own sub collection

140
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,180
and get another now

141
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,480
don't worry about selling it I mean you
can sell for enough to pay for the

142
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,120
postage

143
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,579
the blank for whatever don't worry about
that stuff but it's just not supposed to

144
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:00,420
be retail

145
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,170
the whole idea behind all this as we
figure the world's gonna be a better

146
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,800
place

147
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,730
if we just jack up the literacy rate
education this whole idea is to build

148
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,769
things from the bottom up

149
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,970
not from the top down we don't have any
grants

150
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,259
we don't have any major people talking
for us

151
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:20,759
what you see here's what you get: your
worry about

152
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,000
and there have been

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,269
5 information ages 5

154
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:32,939
technological revolutions that basically
turned the whole idea publishing on its

155
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:33,240
head

156
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,610
now I got a lot I'm gonna run through
all these little slides here and come

157
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,720
back and talk the ones you want to hear
about the most

158
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,769
I'm not stuck with given a pre-prepared
speech

159
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,639
I I could talk what everyone is topics
for the whole time so

160
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,829
if you i'm talking to these boring kinda
like this

161
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:55,839
you know I'm talking about something you
like right but

162
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,029
would just fire to all these this is the
mic wildest dream here

163
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,250
this is as far as I dreamed if we do 10

164
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,839
million public domain books and then

165
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,899
get machine translation to put those
into a hundred different languages

166
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,139
that'll be up billion volume I'm

167
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:23,959
if we give them to one on a 601 to 700
naughty

168
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,809
people on the planet that's a
quintillion

169
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:33,660
books okay so what if I'm off by a
factor of a thousand then I only get to

170
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,740
give way quadrillion

171
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,439
books she that's the goal

172
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,120
we're not waiting

173
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,649
for somebody's approval we're not
waiting for bill gates or any those guys

174
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:47,600
to say hey you guys are doing great work

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,240
although this has been done with no
freakin

176
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,549
money project gutenberg: has never run
through a million dollars in its

177
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:57,799
entirety 35 your existence

178
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,399
all other period not count every

179
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,089
dollar I've had in every dollar that's
coming in on a project gutenberg: all

180
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:08,959
you all you have to do is do this stuff

181
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,919
anybody can make any anyone you can sit
down type it in skiing it in you can

182
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,429
snail mail it to us it will scan it for
you and you can proofread it or will

183
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:18,120
proofread

184
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,980
will do all the copyright research will
do everything we can possibly do

185
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,720
to help you out

186
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,329
this is what if we get a funny question

187
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:35,299
this is me way back in the back there
with the twenty thousand books

188
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,360
it now

189
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,819
some people say that e-books have never
made it there never gonna make it was

190
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,919
gonna pay attention to home

191
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:50,069
this is my counter example this is the
best selling book in the last four years

192
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:53,229
and in the knowledge with Paige

193
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,559
right there's a list I love over a dozen
of the most famous libraries in the

194
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,949
entire planet

195
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:03,360
and you'll notice number three that are
kinda stick sound

196
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,009
it okay we got to be the attack nasa now
we got 2 luv we got all the famous

197
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,269
libraries

198
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,089
the number three analysts project
gutenberg: because

199
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:18,019
we have a very wide variety of Bibles
and Apocrypha

200
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:21,509
all sorts of the stuff that you can't
get anyplace else

201
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,169
nobody wants some nobody has and you can
search a mall he did a lot of research

202
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,259
on this book

203
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:29,610
the only dollars on making a point is
this

204
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,569
kinda library makes really easy to
research shakespeare the Bible

205
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:39,000
the Greek plays stuff like that that's
what I'm hoping for

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,699
that's if we took all those boxes and
put them on top of each other

207
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:48,299
somebody wanna one-sided version I'm
this is a graph

208
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,410
for people who always said every year

209
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,689
that we couldn't do it for one more year

210
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:58,399
every single year there's not been a
year ago why did I haven't got messages

211
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,419
from people

212
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,910
says you can never do it for one more
year

213
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,389
he was a don't worry about Project
Gutenberg they want possibly stick

214
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,039
around for another year

215
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,100
this is how we got to 10,000 box

216
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,689
and this is as accurate as great could
make an

217
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:18,360
I have another graph of here that we can
get up and play with the computer at the

218
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,850
end

219
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,309
that is exactly accurate this one is
proportional spacing

220
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,910
it's very hard to make a graph with
reports of spacing graded as best

221
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,009
but it's not quite perfect I do have a
perfect one for you if you want

222
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,360
this is the same thing up to 20,000

223
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,610
and with your help will stack another
40,000 on top of that

224
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,779
okay what our people Jersey years we've
been doubling

225
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,039
every 18 months or so so more or less
and Moore's Law typeof

226
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:49,289
power curve doubling the number you
books every

227
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:53,679
18 months or so and that's achieved in a
number of ways most it is

228
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,799
technological advancement combined with
more volunteers

229
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,980
and waterways volunteered history Prof
readers

230
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,089
is the easiest place to get started PT
pp

231
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,759
dotnet history Prof readers

232
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,230
every year though we just barely make it
I do have to warn you about that

233
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,880
if you're on my mailing list you will
get notes from were just coming up to it

234
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,559
and people send me back stop jumping up
and down yelling and screaming I know

235
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,469
you're only one percent away from the
goal

236
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,459
the that's the kind of person I am it

237
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,500
don't really want to get it are you know
I wanted the book is right now but if

238
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,439
you guys are more interested in it will
come back to it

239
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:33,799
already mentioned about how anybody can
make in the book

240
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:37,329
is a couple things that great night and
talking about

241
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:43,000
that relate to some the conversations we
heard here already

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,539
we don't care who gets the credit for
the books you send us an ebook

243
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,809
will put your name on it your email
address your URL

244
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:53,699
whatever you like will give you two
lines to put anything you want

245
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,019
if you've got a dot com site and you
want to put the URL on their

246
00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:01,449
that's just fine with me everybody
should get credit for what they do

247
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:04,459
I certainly don't need the credit you
guys to

248
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:07,850
should have the credit by the way for
some odd reason having project

249
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,480
gutenberg: on your resume

250
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,329
seems to help heaven only knows they
would never hire me

251
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,889
but these tend to hire the people that
work for me it

252
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:22,350
and a course that was by anonymous one
of our favorite sources

253
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,529
a lot of books by actually we did

254
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,380
we have a lot of books by this is
something that I love in serve said when

255
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,350
he came to the 10th anniversary a
browser's

256
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,439
Anna I should mention since I were
talking about credit stuff

257
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:39,439
that mark entries in with got no

258
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,429
credit he was never mentioned at the
10th anniversary browsers mosaic was

259
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:44,289
never mentioned

260
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:48,459
escape was never mentioned it was one of
those big political to do is

261
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:53,880
where all the guys in fancy suits that
were wearing my salary

262
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,649
they all got up there and talked about
browsers on ever giving credit to him

263
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:04,649
and that's the way it goes

264
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:11,019
it people are always telling me I can't
do this

265
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:14,260
and I just gotta say okays leave me
alone all succeed or fail

266
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:21,260
and you can watch good

267
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,279
is a much nicer way of saying the same
thing

268
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,490
it works very well if you put one book

269
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,029
in our collection tomorrow

270
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:35,480
there's a billion possible people who
could download

271
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,120
it will never get deleted not one of our
books is ever been deleted we did take

272
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,779
out Martin Luther King's I have a dream
speech without being asked

273
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,100
harami you kept up with the law but it
got changed in reverse then appealed in

274
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,409
all sorts of stuff

275
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,630
it was all over de klerk copyrighted and

276
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,209
we just took it up because without it
was okay with up to slot for it

277
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:01,449
we also have arthur C clarke's
permission we reserve slot 2001 for 2001

278
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:06,289
you but it's not in there

279
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:10,230
night this this gets a little heavy or
light on the same picture

280
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,529
we get a lot of conversations about like
darkness

281
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:17,689
and there are people who look at what's
going on right now I think this is the

282
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,500
greatest information age

283
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,289
it's ever been and there are people who
look at it and say it's a new Dark Ages

284
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:28,169
because a smaller percentage up the
information is available than ever

285
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:29,120
before

286
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,260
since the Gutenberg press copyright has
become virtually permanent

287
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,019
now copyright is not my favorite thing
to talk about but again

288
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:41,169
this is your guide to show what are you
guys ask God we don't have to wait to

289
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,950
the end for questions when we get to the
end

290
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,370
rollback feel free to interrupt me
anywhere in guide this anywhere you like

291
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,970
me I'm hoping that everybody will have

292
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:58,970
a buncha libraries that I brought a
little example

293
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,330
for five dollars at a garage sale

294
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,480
I have these in my room in paper

295
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,600
and my floor is one inch lower than it
was when I put him in there

296
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,419
okay if any if you have ever physically
seen

297
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,929
a century's worth a national Geographics
you know what I'm talking about

298
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:27,299
there massive and this book course if I
took them all output folder

299
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,299
there's only thirty season here not even
DVD's CDs

300
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:34,700
and they would fit in a little kids
carrying case that they carry along with

301
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,250
their walk

302
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,590
winner

303
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,840
alright

304
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,300
I do not I could just as other have
photographs of the pages so the ads that

305
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,810
had

306
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,860
if there was a page was only in and
which there were plenty of

307
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,280
I can't tell you whether all those were
in there or not I thought the ads were

308
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,690
kinda been lightning myself

309
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,800
and very cute tell a lot about our
culture and a lot about the pre-world

310
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,950
war one stuff

311
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,630
without the plan talking about it
afterwards now

312
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,010
we have slight to generation gap I'm
getting

313
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,620
get a little old but most if you could
go into your attic to your basement and

314
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,940
find a paperback

315
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:25,260
that said 25 cents on whether it was an
Agatha Christie rub preachings

316
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,520
ponder a or on Perry Mason or stuff like
that

317
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,370
y&i my parents were book a holics and

318
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,610
buy it was full and those things in rare
were the ones that were fifty cents or

319
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,430
35 cents they were almost all 25 cents

320
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,110
those same box at Borders and Barnes &
Noble stuff today

321
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:51,000
are closing in on ten dollars again I
don't wanna dwell too much on negative

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,570
stuff

323
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:55,200
but I've I can tell you all the changes
I've gone through with paper

324
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,910
publications and prices

325
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,260
and price-fixing and stuff like that but

326
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,660
if you imagine that a gallon a gas

327
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,150
today cost as much as a paperback today

328
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,760
that you think about the media frenzy it
would be going on

329
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,870
they're going nuts with three dollars a
gallon

330
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,260
what the heck with the be doing if we
were pushing ten dollars a gallon

331
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,750
but I've never in my life for one-story

332
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:28,750
about the price of books which is gonna
way faster the price a gas

333
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:38,169
will come back and talk about okay

334
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:42,679
here's the five information age is you
notice one of them was a

335
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:49,020
very very short the United States issued
a patent

336
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,900
in 1830 for the first high-speed
steam-powered printing press

337
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,830
and a copyright law came out to stifle
the thing in eighteen thirty-one

338
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,189
I this was no accident

339
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,710
United States copyright started in 1790

340
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,940
and basically got going pretty well by
the turn of the century

341
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,330
so those books and a maximum

342
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,350
copyrights be an awful lot 28 half years
okay

343
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,960
so they just started expiring so this
guy gets an idea hey

344
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,200
we could build all these reprint houses
and

345
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,630
fellow boxcars on the railroad in ship
of all these books

346
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,929
became and awfully lot easier

347
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:34,799
to print books pretty much to the same
order magnitude is how much easier got

348
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,000
when gutenberg came

349
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,529
now the original copyright was

350
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:44,860
created specifically to stifle the
Gutenberg press I don't want to go into

351
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,200
all the politics let you guys are
seriously interested in English history

352
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,080
but I have a whole list of all the
monarch serving when that they went

353
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,970
through trying to get the law passed

354
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:59,970
and nobody would go for it

355
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,640
and fire and agriculture in the wheel I
do have known of I'm not joking

356
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,640
not I have articles assert with those
you have to write

357
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,290
the first thing I said when they told me
we were on the Internet was I said

358
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,830
did they send a message like what have
got brought and they said no

359
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,070
and I said we have to send something and

360
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,580
I haven't got to that part yet but
that's right typed in the Declaration of

361
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,399
Independence

362
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,420
and tried to email it everybody in a
fight to succeed if you were never heard

363
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,980
the Morris worm but that's another part
of the story tell

364
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,840
I I actually tried the email the
Declaration of Independence

365
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,889
to all 100 people that were on the
internet which would have killed it

366
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,960
but luckily somebody stop me and said
let's put a note on what later became

367
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,050
calm Jim

368
00:22:54,050 --> 00:23:01,050
and would just tell 'em is there and
they can download okay

369
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,620
yes there's a this is we got ninety
minutes here

370
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,420
and you're right I'm skipping over it
like a stone over the water and I

371
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,220
apologize

372
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,820
that any if you there are details and
everybody's interested in I'm more than

373
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,889
happy to go from

374
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,310
have get up to the microphone just
interrupt we have something to say

375
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:20,600
be happier I'll repeat the question as
to if you don't wanna

376
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,780
jumbo so went when I grew up

377
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,610
it was the 1909 copyright and everything
could be copied from maximum a fifty six

378
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:31,060
years

379
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,560
28 with the 28 year renewal stuff like
gone with the wind in the wizard of oz

380
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,790
paul sr Peter p.m. all the things I grew
up with

381
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,470
it with basic idea was if you saw it in
print and you live to be over 50 years

382
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,120
old

383
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,780
you are going to be able to republish
yourself however

384
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,690
while I was working on a particular
issue shakespeare

385
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,890
for the Gutenberg Project on they
extended the copyright law

386
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:02,540
back in 1976 because it is iraq
switching they also extended in 1909

387
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,840
due to the high speed electric presses
on there's

388
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,679
I've great story there I i feel like i
really should tell why all this stuff

389
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,170
happens

390
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,560
the sears catalog

391
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,700
was a 760

392
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,110
a page for lavishly illustrated

393
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,970
that was the first book owned by
millions and millions and millions of

394
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,450
people

395
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,090
because the combination

396
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,730
all a bunch of different kinds a
technology including the

397
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,200
Transcontinental Railroad

398
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,220
the high-speed printing presses rural
federal delivery which everybody forgets

399
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,800
about

400
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,950
but before then you could mail stuff to
people on the boonies

401
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,800
and everybody lived out in the boonies
so

402
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,700
Sears Scott really wise idea
mass-producing millions and millions

403
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,320
millions in these things and mailing
them to every single person they could

404
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,780
find

405
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,120
this upset the publishing industry

406
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,910
all to how because all the sudden
everybody was aware that you could

407
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,600
make a huge book and

408
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,740
send it to somebody at last cost

409
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,730
that could be recovered if they bought a
couple things on the catalog this drove

410
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,140
everybody absolutely nuts

411
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,600
and copyright was yet extended again

412
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,010
to stop the what they called reprint
houses

413
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,010
be going to use bookstores the look and
stuff it's a hundred years old you see a

414
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,820
lot of things by publishers that don't
exist anymore

415
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,860
but a few that do are cross and Dunlap
in Collier's and stuff like that

416
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,990
who specialized in reprinting stuff the
%uh to realize

417
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,640
that in nineteen hundred you could print
almost anything published

418
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,740
more than 25 years before them ninety
percent of all copyrights had never been

419
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,320
renewed

420
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,750
now if you wanna fight with these
statistics the fight with him

421
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,860
still because he is a PhD

422
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,080
of Library and Information Science knows
this stuff better than I did

423
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,889
and still the case ninety ninety percent
are not renewed

424
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,180
this means by the way that we have an
opportunity for about

425
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,260
a million books that you might think are
still under copyright

426
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,350
between 1923 in 1963 and you're actually
the public domain

427
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,710
we started that with our our rule 6 for
those is seen the website for copyright

428
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,870
clearance and

429
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,560
this is awesome opportunity for
harvesting the Senate these DVD's going

430
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,040
around

431
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,690
they are okay I like you got a library

432
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,730
you know maybe maybe I maybe have a
child maybe if you know someone younger

433
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,970
school library

434
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,710
17,000 the books is more than you find
in the after school library you know

435
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,930
someone that likes that much

436
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,480
you know someone that would like to get
one of these take take a couple we have

437
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,980
a whole box them back here

438
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,000
at the end talk will take a few boxes
with us to the

439
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,090
I to the pent-up course area I'm also
very funny

440
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,220
throwing them people just just one
o'clock by real quick

441
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,840
you did say that their to these the
others there there's one we're handing

442
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,780
out yesterday that has a different stamp
on it

443
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,899
because I'm see we're seeing a red one
and away we go round

444
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,380
we just want to clarify the odd the 2006
1

445
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,550
is one that should be going around I
they should be styled they're all

446
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,970
stamped it came from the same

447
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,220
volunteer the produce them its I should
say 2006

448
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,250
on it at you are you probably got when
you checked and

449
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,820
any on when you out I register for the
when you showed up a conference

450
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,490
is the Act 2003 edition those have a lot
of overlap

451
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,650
although numbers things from 2003 been
updated

452
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,370
since then so I we do have a whole bunch
%uh both these

453
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,770
if you take them both you'll have eyes
for an older version your version

454
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,710
and and the older one is primarily plain

455
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,250
this one has a a lot of plain taxers EPT
as well as lotteries gmail

456
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,690
summer in the multimedia stuff like that
on the ad the atom bomb

457
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,300
explosion we have by Janis Ian doing
society's child when your favorites

458
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,860
she did it live for us just for us and
some

459
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,040
totally project gutenberg: version yeah
very cool are

460
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,870
so I yes oh so few if you want both go
ahead take both we have we definitely

461
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,510
have enough to want to give away both

462
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,950
whether different colors just cuz we we
tend to buy these in bulk and I get the

463
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,910
cheapest deals they might not match

464
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:10,770
but should be stamped with 2006 for the
other 1i was mentioning the most recent

465
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,070
one

466
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,149
as I said the I so for that I is online
someplace but not really advertise if

467
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,800
you're desperate to get it right away

468
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,410
I drop me an email or ask we'll tell you
where to get it allowed elevate uploaded

469
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,730
to the Gutenberg org site

470
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,280
our next couple days and we have several
other one still

471
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,960
does the project for it for me for the
books that its

472
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,160
as far as renewed 3d yes but it's a
closed-form

473
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,720
the preferred format we're we're really
committed two formats which are editable

474
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,350
you can fix that you can use for
derivative works you can put your book

475
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,920
report stuff like that

476
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,620
basically that means we have a a bias
towards including plane tax but that

477
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,700
doesn't mean we are limited

478
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,810
the plane tax these days prolly AV

479
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:57,270
your 90 85 percent over our new books
are in HTML plus tax

480
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,700
arm usually the taxes derivative from
the HTML Seychelles a master

481
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,460
work we have just a few and we're going
to be doing this in the future with the

482
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,550
Servite proofreaders

483
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:10,820
is I XML so they'll be born as XML using
T I it's like the TV

484
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,290
as you care and %ah convert from XML to

485
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,830
just about any viable format we're going
to do

486
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,730
tax HTML maybe a couple others and store
those

487
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:26,450
on our servers and goes out to all our
viewers around the world

488
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,110
and then what we want to do in right we
don't have this fully activated yet and

489
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,360
you some skilled people for this is due
almost any other reasonable format on

490
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,170
the fly

491
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,340
so a PDF on the fly from an XML is cake

492
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,440
right on an easel CPU power to throw the
problem

493
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,960
and all of a sudden instead of having
one PDF file like you get from these

494
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,740
you know for a few sites with the books
you say hey I want this font

495
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,110
I want this size paper on it you left
and right margins verses

496
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,800
no se margins and get your ebook your
way was something we feel really I

497
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
strongly doubt

498
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,050
so we I have I think clearly about one

499
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,180
PDF on the book and now is is the book
that seventy two languages and

500
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,050
on editorials just impossible you can
even do with our TF

501
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,320
so otherwise we really are committed
edible formats

502
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,450
we also go back and fix you books to the
to at least a couple dozen

503
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,690
week and that's obviously important to
have an editable file I can't really fix

504
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:25,360
a PDF file to easily

505
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,840
if you clicked its

506
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,240
yeah will take will take all up Tech
Talks we would like to archive and I

507
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,250
think come

508
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,670
one thing that we've we have a delight
in the main gutenberg collection

509
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,650
good burger or collection which is this
close to 20,000 that that we're doing a

510
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,740
DVD

511
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,690
is we arm we've we've avoided doing a la
the technical books because they're

512
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,880
they can be transient and also there are
usually lot of other people are doing

513
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,160
those these days

514
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,510
what we're doing this gets back to the
slide you had earlier about

515
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,030
are the average person before gutenberg
having only one

516
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,530
you library right so we're doing
collections of collections

517
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,149
and what I'd really like to do is set up
a tactical

518
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,700
you book collections that all the people
that are doing like

519
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,450
your free documentation licenses create
a common sight slices

520
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,200
if they'd like to contribute their stuff
I would like to provide a place for

521
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,870
where that can not go in the archive we
are you we actually are up

522
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,640
arm are pretty close collaborators with
the Internet Archive and some these

523
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,170
other

524
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,450
projects and I just like them you know
we believe that

525
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,700
that if is spinning if it's online its
mirrored is on desk is downloadable

526
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,830
we feel like that's that's a a pretty
good place to be

527
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,399
on we are concerned about things that
are on paper someplace in our digital

528
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,470
and maybe I'll just be accessible in ten
years twenty years thirty years

529
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,240
we feel really saw strongly that this
get back to the previous question about

530
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,160
tax

531
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,060
that the work we do today had better
still be usable

532
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,879
valuable relevant you we don't know how
many people going user for what

533
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,330
wanna least make it sure is still usable
accessible in

534
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,060
certainly twenty years thirty years
fifty years not just five years ten

535
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,260
years and if we are going with the
format of the day

536
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,610
twenty years ago we have format that we
can read today in fact

537
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:19,260
we do have one we have supported the
shakespeare's in the folio for

538
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,260
.in dot the NFL from format out were
little barris about God people I emailed

539
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,560
say I can open this result neither can
we:

540
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,450
record a leader they saw a writer reader
the future

541
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,450
just the people ask is why we don't go
only with

542
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,950
PDF and stuff like that the reason is
that people own

543
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:40,710
it's a proprietary format and we want to
make sure that all this stuff is going

544
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,880
to be a he's dreamy shorter than I am

545
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,520
fifty years is nothing in my dreams I'm
Todd thinking about how this is all

546
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,639
gonna look up thousand years from now

547
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,410
now maybe a hundred thousand years I
just

548
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,550
like a set of I get to a quadrillion
book some I'm happy

549
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,300
yeah downloaded a lot your

550
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,810
on human great audio books and love them

551
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,399
just when I point of it all doing
audiobooks

552
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,520
human right audio books yeah we're
recruiting actors and people like that

553
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,870
we've hit up the Screen Actors Guild is
a lot of out-of-work actors out there

554
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,660
and we're we're hitting them up and
we're also working on more and more

555
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,140
different programs

556
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,310
where the words have actually been read
into the program's by humans

557
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:31,260
much like the old MIDI I remember the
MIDI synthesizers that actually some of

558
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,020
them use

559
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,379
synthetic tones and some home actually
had people play the notes in 20 minutes

560
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,100
re

561
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,130
produce the note for you we're working
on every one of those aspects

562
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:44,620
and it's a little slower than I would
like but is coming

563
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,650
we have 52 are really good partner sites
and that its liberal box

564
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,520
and literal system that's a little box
probably out ahead a little bit but

565
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,530
Tom of you to convert .org slash audio

566
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:01,050
that link to the sites and the human red
audiobooks I just put one on this cuz

567
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,270
250 megabytes I put on the

568
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,590
Sherlock Holmes our sure combs readings
wonderful

569
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:12,080
arm so-so mostly we're trying to work
with of projects that are more geared

570
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,000
towards

571
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,860
doing the things that are required for
human right audio books which involves

572
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,030
some different things and doing the the
plain text books and they were starting

573
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,860
to collect and we haven't like they were
continuing to collect them

574
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,169
in the good berkeley actually got 50 or
75 human red

575
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:29,270
got about 300 computer died

576
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,469
Texas beach I'm

577
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,020
I want to ask if there's any scope
within project gutenberg: for

578
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,840
not just expired copyright and all
things but people who wanna write

579
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,000
something today

580
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,360
and maybe contributor Creative Commons
are public domain

581
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,840
we have several different ways to do
that and if you the people email us we

582
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,320
try to figure out what their goals are
so which one would work out best forum

583
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,669
we have a preprint site we have
approximately two percent of our stuff

584
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:56,520
is still

585
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,000
done copyrighted by permission of
current authors

586
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,970
some people keep the contract give us
permission some people give us the

587
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,640
copyrights some people put in the public
domain

588
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,150
every there's a lot of different ways to
solve that problem

589
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,260
we're working on modern-day stuff as
well

590
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,820
the %uh the main and II impediment for
some folks

591
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,430
is we will match before about PDF and
stuff like that so many people have

592
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,790
formats that were are concerned about
their longevity

593
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,680
and so what we usually do with those you
mention we don't put into the main

594
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,629
Berkel action but we have this
preference I'll tell your web browser up

595
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,350
and you can see it said prefer in stock
reading ru .ms

596
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,630
which is reading rooms right and I we
love to get stuff

597
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:41,900
yeah back to the old sec

598
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,380
do does the copyright homie

599
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,690
the top deal with does apply only to be

600
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,600
work that's being read or the reading
itself if you want to copy write your

601
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,860
own reading on it

602
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,400
you can do that will become your audio
edition

603
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,810
and if you if you want to create your
own paper edition you can do that too

604
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,290
now United States law requires more
intellectual input to get a copy right

605
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,420
then other countries laws

606
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,860
some of them have what they call the
sweater the brow kinda stuff

607
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,400
and we don't have much in there so you
would have to do something rather unique

608
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,460
with reading is very unique

609
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,170
so that would be very easy for you to
copyright okay that was warning because

610
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,820
I have

611
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,050
like old tape or old

612
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,670
final recordings audio production that

613
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,940
I know some of we wanna check

614
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,380
with a good copyright lawyer cuz the law
on all that changed in nineteen

615
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,560
seventy-two

616
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,040
if you have any records in 1972 and
before

617
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,500
there's a very good chance that they
don't get a copyright in it

618
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,860
okay but you do want to check it I'm I
know thousand times more about copyright

619
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,180
than you ever wanted to know

620
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,230
and I can answer all the questions
anyway and

621
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,300
if if they're clear sure you did

622
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,430
like mp3 right well if you do your
research oh yeah

623
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,290
any the form its it if you do your
research on this often you come up with

624
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,029
the reasonable decision that its public
domain

625
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:13,870
you what the cost innocent infringer
they can sue you for a hundred boxer 200

626
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,890
bucks or something

627
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,060
you know but they can't take your house
or anything on because

628
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,100
you did some research in some you know
you did enough to say I think this is in

629
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,170
the public domain

630
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,900
but it helps to do some research and
will help you do it yeah that's that's

631
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,410
what you gotta understand we are

632
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,080
as mike said were unwilling experts in
now and copyright

633
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,540
and we have if you go to convert .org is
a how-to section we have a copyright how

634
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,330
to you

635
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,740
this is distillation love Bob 45

636
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,930
very big on lawyers

637
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,899
very expert lawyers and copyright

638
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,210
issues and we we keep Pattinson
trademark that says everything but for

639
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:50,980
copyright

640
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,820
we have a whole procedure to go through
and when we go through that procedure

641
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,940
when when you go to the gutenberg site
and you let us to your copyright will

642
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,710
you do that

643
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,320
you provide the information then we make
a determination of public domain status:

644
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,480
I'll we we haven't been wrong yet
basically we've we've got me a few

645
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,820
things that are gray area

646
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,200
there's some things that are there their
arm up in the air

647
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,910
awesome you might have heard about the
orphan works decisions are some stuff

648
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,210
it's

649
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,630
tell something section 108 apes they're
looking at so there are some things that

650
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,410
are great we're actually trying to push
those boundaries

651
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:24,870
where we think that basically you know
there's a reason

652
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,779
basically fall to the people rather than
falling to some long-dead

653
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,160
author's estate na na kar I'm also gonna
warn everybody I am gonna try to give in

654
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,020
some more

655
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:38,590
up but i wanna talk about I

656
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:42,710
%ah not on our I've I just don't want to
give told leon we were good so far in

657
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,980
the contract and we could stay there
forever and that's good

658
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,340
but I want to get to the end and bounce
back so you know what the options are

659
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:52,120
soon as we know what the options are
then I'm willing to go for any the

660
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,420
options that are available

661
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,570
yes let's go I'll get back as I was
asleep inside

662
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,260
go ahead while he's playing with it the
you have it stops it

663
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,660
still books from books for free

664
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,910
it's upset the the road you books

665
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,930
audio books for free dot org it's a
place that gave us some love are you

666
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,080
books there there I

667
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,040
non not a a in our car possibility that
is people we work with you get those

668
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,259
particular items

669
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,850
by you only have a substantive group
that's right

670
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:29,130
a subset of their books yet so audio
books for free is job to a site that

671
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,520
space in the UK

672
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,900
they do live pretty pretty professional
readings as opposed to

673
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,140
livevox with sound very good but they're
they're really amateurs

674
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,140
and they do have God not only for their
books they also have some higher

675
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,379
I like hysteria have some higher-quality

676
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,870
higher sound quality recordings not I
want to sleep like five or 10 minutes

677
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,620
right now

678
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,500
to just tryna cover all a joke at least
for one second appease

679
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,540
gonna wanna please throw out there then
you guys can pick which one here

680
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,490
each one of these inventions and I've
been talking about change

681
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,650
the whole idea of civilization

682
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,940
changed what it was to be a member of a
civilization

683
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,510
what a member of society change the idea

684
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,000
I'll how much you could no how much you
could look up

685
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,190
how much information you could have
without somebody else telling it to you

686
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,540
we were always so dependent on somebody
else telling us everything

687
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,550
and each one of these gay people

688
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,950
an opportunity to have a truly

689
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,170
encyclopedia incentive knowledge

690
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,300
in their own house now when I was a kid
these things cost 1500 bucks

691
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,510
for that great looks at a restaurant
world in the britannica

692
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,700
the Americana and all those are the
things that I grew up with

693
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,960
arm today you know I'm sure that
somebody here is gone on poverty in the

694
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,440
car for fifteen dollars on a DVD like I
did

695
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,210
brand new I could tell you how many
copies I have in the britannica

696
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:02,520
on DVD and CD but I can tell you that I
do have one for every 10 years for over

697
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,330
a century in paper

698
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,620
it um these things are fantastic

699
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:14,359
and it's just going to keep going on
that way unless they stop us

700
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:19,549
right now the concept the copyright has
been determined by the US Supreme Court

701
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:23,820
as to the possibly permanent

702
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,359
there was how media for Nov %ah Eldred
verses ashcroft

703
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,540
before was older versus ashcroft it was
hard

704
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,759
that's me versus reno

705
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,560
and I was suing on behalf a project
gutenberg:

706
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,009
but the lawyers were doing such a
terrible job by fire

707
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:47,609
I don't ready that's not a great story
but that the

708
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:51,750
a that came in they were going to lose
524 they lost 72

709
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,180
alright you but now the Supreme Court
even worse

710
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,700
so I don't think there's any chance up
getting the law changed

711
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,550
unless there's somebody out there who's
willing to be much more revolutionary

712
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,080
than I am

713
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:09,660
things are gonna happen quite a bit
differently a hundred years ago

714
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,180
over half of all copyrights had expired

715
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,779
it was a very nice kinda ratio new stuff
was coming in the publication about as

716
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,940
fast as your stuff is going out

717
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,230
kinda nice a hundred years from now

718
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,280
99.99 and I don't know how many more
nines

719
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,910
I'll everything that was ever
copyrighted well still

720
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:35,710
be under copyright

721
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:40,460
if I i wanna bring a budget dishes and
dual stack up dishes and Sonia

722
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,609
with pie charts on the dishes because if
I took a couple sex a dish is taller

723
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:45,700
than I am

724
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,080
I could make the mark of how big a
percentage in the year 2100

725
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,170
by taking a plane and drawing a little
triangle in it

726
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,520
about that wide on dinner

727
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,350
that will be I mean if you take your kid
to the new Lion King

728
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:04,370
take a five year old kid to the new
version Lion King this year

729
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,170
that kid will have to live to 2100

730
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,070
before that copyright would expire even
if it's never extended

731
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:15,320
again I don't want to go too far into
that may not be what you want guys wanna

732
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,100
hear about

733
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,859
but every one of these five information
age is was countered

734
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:24,339
by a copyright to stop the technology
that could have given

735
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:29,850
everybody basically all the information
in the war

736
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,920
this has happened before and it said
gonna have to have something more

737
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,670
revolutionary night

738
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:41,680
okay now why are they doing all

739
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,609
they're setting up precedents our legal
system is based on precedence

740
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:50,779
not know how many have you guys ever
seen a replicator product in real life

741
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:57,780
I brought some

742
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,130
ever heard at the MIT fam lab

743
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,420
I gave a speech over there last week and
they were kind enough to make me some

744
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,470
goodies to show you

745
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,010
this is a mounting bracket for a
solenoid in and of itself it's not

746
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,140
terribly cute

747
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,790
except for the fact it was made by a
forty thousand pounds per square

748
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,029
inch water trough

749
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:24,960
cutest little gizmos I've ever seen we
made a bunch of these

750
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,940
this is really cue and it's like I said
there's nothing special about another

751
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,310
factor how it was made

752
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:34,680
nobody ever touched used to this peace
and that when they're just near

753
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,859
you know got have goggles on

754
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:41,140
this is appalling goes on a

755
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,200
axle has little notch to put the rope on
you

756
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,710
right rope around and it was part of a
triple send a police in a big easy one

757
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,410
this was cut out by a laser and

758
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,819
a laser that was finely tuned enough I
didn't even have to wear delays approve

759
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,130
goggles I got to watch it make this
thing

760
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,960
and this is seriously hard

761
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,660
this is about sixty to eighty percent as
hard as anything you could make

762
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,899
polio its not rapid prototyping

763
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,290
anymore it's not just soft plastic

764
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,890
you can make real operational stuff

765
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,279
ready to go and yes of course

766
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,350
is a starship I

767
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:28,310
and this is ABS plastic and there are
half a dozen other materials you can

768
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:28,890
make

769
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:33,520
things out that I just I didn't find
this whole idea for years and years and

770
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,170
years

771
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,830
I started talking about faxing pizzas
and doing stuff like that back in the

772
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:38,950
early 90's

773
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,430
and that was nice to lose my audience
when I talked about that stuff they just

774
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:42,859
they just

775
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:46,740
Wallace comes up launch its pizza from a
fax machine

776
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:52,730
we gotta shoot him pppppp

777
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,690
was a

778
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,910
I'll this lets layer by layer for those
with a

779
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,690
run the layers and this particular 1i
didn't watch this particular one

780
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:08,609
me the 1i watched be made was made out
the old polymer stuff

781
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:11,990
this is if you can look as I can send
you the program for this

782
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:15,450
and I can send you hope homeless to the
composite it's me

783
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:21,120
email me I have effect I have right
around my neck

784
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,390
it's all right here when I was walking
to the family my stock

785
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,339
this and everything it was making
downloaded the instructions

786
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:34,850
I

787
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:39,299
and I have permission from the MIT guys
to put those three things

788
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,690
on project gutenberg: so you will see
them you can't download it will make

789
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,350
your own

790
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,960
you can find out exactly how it's me it

791
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,310
okay now again I I wanna be with much
time you guys as possible

792
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,210
on I designed it crayon jet printer

793
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,250
years and years ago that you probably
don't want to hear about this its easy

794
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,210
to think about

795
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:04,240
image in multiple pieces a wax and
firing them off and you could build up

796
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,990
a really great relief map have anything
you want

797
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,870
I thought this was just totally cosmic
until somebody printed be on a human

798
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,130
hand

799
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,210
and you could almost read the
fingerprints the resolution was so good

800
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,810
you could read that you could take it to
a palm reader you could read the poem

801
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,250
is unbelievable stuff that you can make
with these things

802
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:29,850
um I do still lose people when I talk
about driving away in a Ferrari that you

803
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,310
print on your computer

804
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:34,589
cuz you gotta give oil between the
cylinders and everything but I still say

805
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:37,190
that you will be able to do it someday

806
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:40,500
think about I'm sure some with you with
those guys were talking about the Cocos

807
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,530
and all that

808
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,730
remember when it was only one color it
was a bit

809
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,080
it was either on or off that was it that
was a number colors you got

810
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,250
and now you can get less than 16 million
colors

811
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:58,210
and you can get a lot more I say the
same thing for these materials

812
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:01,420
all you have to do is double the number
materials every so often

813
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,620
and eventually you have all the
materials you want so

814
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,759
don't get to tied up in that that if you
like that stuff

815
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:15,760
read diamond age

816
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,109
if you look at my pictures on the web
forum up in a tree

817
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:22,200
reading a book this is what I'm reading

818
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,660
this is the only hardback book ever
bought new

819
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:30,049
off-the-shelf when it was new in my own
life

820
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:34,790
and it was before I knew Neil I actually
went to a conference like this one and i

821
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:38,300
was standing in line with a couple of
weirdos we have a great conversation

822
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,540
and make a long story short we got to
the end we put our badges on

823
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,690
and one of them was seen June in the
other one was Neil

824
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:49,560
and the other ones me and I while what
cool threatens

825
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:53,020
is likely put the bags 0 your you 0

826
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:59,890
you know yep we have been the acting up
a storm in line for 45 minutes

827
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,390
and have more fun we had during the tire
conference

828
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,720
okay engines a creation by Eric Drexler

829
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,410
its it's not a novel but I read it like
one

830
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,950
I just ate the whole thing up so
interested in nanotech

831
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,109
and replicators stuff I'm telling you
know

832
00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:24,870
you can buy a 3d printer now for less
than an IBM ATT cost in 1984

833
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:29,740
about a full body eighty not even
counting inflation

834
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:33,510
the same list price: not counting
inflation

835
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,609
you can build I want people printing out

836
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:40,670
donatella David and Michelangelo's David
in the Venus de Milo

837
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,920
and all that stuff not just Mona Lisa

838
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,720
okay gotta get this is details we can
get into later

839
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:55,720
i'm suppose to mention the world the
book fair um

840
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:59,770
I just got to go for it I'm I don't like
cum

841
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:03,240
and like on my own too much

842
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,940
but I asked a friend of mine

843
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,810
to help you summary the 35th anniversary

844
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,960
sit down Thomas in

845
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,950
tied dependents

846
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:24,609
so he gave you cripple your box

847
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:31,609
I could give you and they're all right
there

848
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,500
if you go to world he Book Fair dot com

849
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,210
for the next two weeks till August 4
there's

850
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:51,520
on the project gutenberg: books and
there's a quarter of a million more

851
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,580
not coming for duplication there's over
350,000

852
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:58,910
we're say we got a third and they're all
free

853
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,170
search him out download them give those
to your friends too

854
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:05,750
we just i just want to get the maximum
publicity for everybody

855
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,090
and this is a guy who sells these and
he's given away for free

856
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:13,280
for all month just cuz I asked really
nice

857
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,120
more junk here's here's the traffic
pattern

858
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,339
for some reason nobody comes in on the
weekend sold

859
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,680
if you get in there right now you should
be able to suck up what's a box it

860
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,760
and it looks like a lot of our traffic
coming from Europe and Asia

861
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,430
much more that we expected so that's the
traffic pattern

862
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:36,220
the world fair says the first couple
days

863
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,500
where we had to switch servers and wires
into all sorts of things because it was

864
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,110
just getting

865
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:43,890
overloaded to the max we've given away
over a million books today

866
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:48,569
every day since about July 7 South

867
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:52,580
32 days we're gonna have I'm gonna guess
we're gonna make it to thirty 30 million

868
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,000
books

869
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,520
but we also give Lee 30 million books
right here at this conference

870
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,090
okay

871
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:05,760
you know dat did this is how you can
volunteer

872
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,630
the easiest way to volunteers just send
me e-mail I love helping people

873
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,470
volunteer

874
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,670
50,000 volunteers and they all say I'm
so sorry to bother you

875
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:19,480
and I that's what I'm here for here to
help you guys figure out how to get

876
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,000
started

877
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,890
John alright

878
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:28,620
so now officially we got back to the end
and the beginning

879
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,109
so now we can go to any one of those
spots you want or

880
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:36,050
other spots I apologize but I just wanna
make sure got everything covered

881
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:39,880
okay question yes you have a question

882
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:46,580
since you open formats like since you
gotta push these open formats like

883
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,420
brought taxed

884
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,390
stuff arm have you had any blind
visually disabled people

885
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:54,450
call call you up and say hey thanks a
lot it

886
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,870
traditionally they would have to find
the book printed in braille and not

887
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:58,259
everything

888
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,180
me braille right there's a month goes by
and I don't get a note from some

889
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,980
visually impaired persons as please
don't ever stop making plain text the

890
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,470
works

891
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:13,570
not I gotta I got a string a couple
things out is not the time against all

892
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:14,730
these other formats:

893
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:19,400
people have misquoted me is a 125 for
some other form and said michael Hart

894
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,510
wrote the kill and all week you know

895
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:25,270
I wanna kill Adobe I just wanna plain
text

896
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:29,570
to I went to meet with a TI guys back in
that

897
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:33,860
ninety or something like that and they
wanted to destroy plain text

898
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,270
there was he Library of Congress

899
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:41,890
sana workshop on the text I in 1992

900
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:46,640
that never once mentioned plane tax
integrate revenge I got because they

901
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,759
published it in PDF format wanted to get
some feedback of the list servers and no

902
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,590
by the insert and week after week after
week I got 2 G's

903
00:53:55,590 --> 00:54:00,750
home in front of 10,000 readers and say
you know why they're not answering

904
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:04,500
because they wanted in plain text they
don't wanna play with PDF

905
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,610
now this is 1992 it didn't come up
automatically okay had

906
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:10,650
fool around you never got one message
one person

907
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,500
until they put on a plain text saw
montezuma

908
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:19,630
I got my revenge do you have to have a
sense that they use for text to speech

909
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:23,760
for oh yes you're much easier plain text
works for everything now

910
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,850
what this team is XML kinda thing the
greg was talking about you should be

911
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,710
able to create plain text on that

912
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,220
so I got nothing against being able to
to go this way and that way

913
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:37,970
as long as you can get back to something
that the average person wants to use

914
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:41,900
interview coming up the IEEE magazine
today I think

915
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,020
on was really hard on me about that

916
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,030
and I said the reason I do that is
because I can stand here and say I

917
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:53,760
dare you I double dog dare you to find
one computer

918
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,200
the won't read our books yet

919
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,350
let's talk about free also the blind
bookworm

920
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:07,020
is all one site where they lots about
use

921
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:11,030
converting to April format with an FB
friends

922
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:14,520
is something that we're planning on
offering than that little spaces again

923
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,680
good opportunity and up but I really
wanna play garin

924
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,410
Aaron is the guy that manages our CD rom

925
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:25,310
giveaway project he was a guy that
burned 1500 these brand new

926
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,910
%ah I says a brand-new he's a writer to
give away

927
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,950
he's blind is a college student in
totally blind

928
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:36,970
caused in its Aaron can so thanks

929
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:41,980
group

930
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:46,240
not to help you books are fantastic for

931
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,299
educating people around the world but
for

932
00:55:49,299 --> 00:55:53,059
for a reason the world the hardware to
read e-books

933
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:56,319
might not necessarily be is readily
available things like dollar

934
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,660
laptop project certainly help that sort
of thing

935
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,480
fifty dollar leapt up probably better
200 first

936
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,010
I'm just curious what your take is on
the hardware with

937
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:10,690
ePaper eating solutions: things like
that starting to come

938
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:15,660
I got two answers to that one is while I
was in a mighty I just happened to be

939
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,980
with a hundred dollar laptop guys and
we're gonna do some kind a joint project

940
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:26,980
with them

941
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:29,710
and my own

942
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:33,819
I I like to work for the bottom-up I'm a
simple guy when it comes to that stuff

943
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:37,410
all my suffers from garage sales
everything you see

944
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:40,410
I was everything I own is from process
and

945
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,899
my solution to that particular question

946
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,440
his cell phones in the next 12 months

947
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,660
they're going to be up billion new cell
phones

948
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:56,390
in the war and I'm pushing up for a
friend of mine named John beat see

949
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:00,690
from Malta who has a little sign up
mobile books and stuff like that email

950
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:01,150
me and

951
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,210
I'll tell you all about her go toward
latest newsletters that ira month ago

952
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:06,329
cuz I've been on the road a month

953
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:10,440
and Dom you can download 5,000

954
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,349
are books that have already been
converted into a WEP

955
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:18,739
compatible cell phone and we're gonna
put lots of other cell phone

956
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:23,299
the iPod was only out for a week before
somebody wrote a program to read her

957
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:24,430
stuff on the iPod

958
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:27,450
i'm waiting for somebody to read out
loud on the iPod

959
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:31,849
all sorts of things like that so yeah
cell phone I got a message

960
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:35,499
a text message from a guy from the cell
phone on the seven get the plane in

961
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:36,039
Africa

962
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:39,569
who's read one of our books and were due
and I thought yes

963
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:46,569
that's the definite wait for this to go
if guys gonna have to decide who's

964
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:50,950
online

965
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:54,289
person sorry that's me on I actually

966
00:57:54,289 --> 00:57:59,170
I thought I was sort of a side note
almost the idea distributed proofreading

967
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,410
I heard also from the folks for this
media which I don't know if you guys

968
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:02,848
know

969
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:07,109
it's really a lot of under the folks who
revealed that distributed

970
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:10,900
journalism research they revealed that
there was a diet

971
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,989
been allowed into the White House press
corps who is not only republican plant

972
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:15,859
water but was also a male prostitute

973
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:19,509
so %uh you note so they're also working
that sorta

974
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:23,640
a side note that they thereof but that
they also have distributed proofreaders

975
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,339
issued its action occurs no wonder how
long do you think that miles from the

976
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:26,839
Bible

977
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:29,769
because it's one of those things that
just sorta you know takes a lot of time

978
00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:31,349
it's a labor of love

979
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:34,869
helical I can imagine it stopping

980
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:40,150
for several reasons the first reason
which was valid twenty years ago does it

981
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,819
is today

982
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:44,519
is that you can take a diff program our
comp program

983
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:47,730
and compare any the files to different
people proofread see all the differences

984
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,450
in one second somebody changed one comma

985
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:54,410
you think it's gonna pop up so we always
had the issue

986
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:59,710
way way way back when %uh 1984 is on if
you'll notice the first book sided

987
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:04,440
there are like 20 or 30 persons a
balance in Wonderland literally is that

988
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,759
all the way up to Alice 30

989
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:09,999
not HTML stuff because every time I
change it like put a new file up so you

990
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:11,710
could see the whole evolution

991
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:16,239
from the first one and how we got really
the errors little by little now

992
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:20,130
distributed proofreaders for those who
don't know is a set up

993
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,859
where you can come in and proofread
one-page while you wait for some you

994
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:24,700
come pick you up

995
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,569
his log in and grab a page you can grab
another page you sit there and let me

996
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,839
just as official on

997
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:34,089
you could claim a whole book if you want
but a lot of people just pop in here in

998
00:59:34,089 --> 00:59:34,460
there

999
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,519
there are single we had a big rush one
week and I think we're

1000
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:42,359
there like 12 thousand people
proofreading in one weekend

1001
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:46,730
it just gets absolutely berserk is how
many pages you can get done

1002
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:53,730
and we have everyone I'm done twice by
the way yeah

1003
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,369
we have done copyright research in all
sorts of other things for

1004
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:04,309
in the body who was interested in the
box ever since I started I

1005
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,789
I just want to promote e-books you
notice in our mission statement

1006
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:11,910
it didn't say public domain e-books or
nonprofit the books or anything like

1007
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:12,348
that

1008
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:15,619
is my job is to promote

1009
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:20,140
the creation and distribution the box
period very

1010
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,319
everybody who started the book business
way back when

1011
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:27,569
called me and I help them to the best of
my ability

1012
01:00:27,569 --> 01:00:31,589
so a cult this early proofreaders

1013
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:35,788
is %ah an organization that's up you
extremely close its Leah

1014
01:00:35,789 --> 01:00:39,449
we buy their hardware we have you really
type

1015
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:43,140
ties but they make their own decisions
also about what

1016
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,368
give to process and they do focus a lot
on the public domain

1017
01:00:46,369 --> 01:00:50,180
and that's great I'll we I encourage
people and they'll help

1018
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:53,809
to set up additional service providers
we have one say that's up and running

1019
01:00:53,809 --> 01:00:54,680
pretty successfully

1020
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:58,459
IDPs Europe and would like to set up
other sites of people have particular

1021
01:00:58,459 --> 01:00:59,799
areas that are interested in

1022
01:00:59,799 --> 01:01:03,249
then then you can you can work with a DP
folks get the code

1023
01:01:03,249 --> 01:01:09,249
is so access to manuscripts and papers
as a big deal in scientific publishing

1024
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:12,819
don't know if you guys at me connections
with people at the Public Library of

1025
01:01:12,819 --> 01:01:13,449
Science

1026
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:16,479
the lowest or.org over okay

1027
01:01:16,479 --> 01:01:21,150
we've stopped emails with some on
sometimes people like that ask us to

1028
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,479
make a backup forum

1029
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:26,509
and sometimes they want to keep it
private cuz they want to get all hits

1030
01:01:26,509 --> 01:01:30,099
again we don't care who gets the hats we

1031
01:01:30,099 --> 01:01:34,479
we help in any way that we can form and
if you if you know somebody there and

1032
01:01:34,479 --> 01:01:36,949
you think you can make a connection for
sweet with my

1033
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:41,130
no I do but I just mention it because it
did it takes the same issue opening up

1034
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,400
copyrights and access to scientific
literature

1035
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,609
on and so my question is about

1036
01:01:46,609 --> 01:01:51,069
on scientists and and just any reader in
general people build up their own

1037
01:01:51,069 --> 01:01:52,779
libraries have the course their lifetime

1038
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:56,259
and yet you know I want my library to be
accessible by anybody

1039
01:01:56,259 --> 01:01:59,859
my personal library and I think you know
if somebody wants to share the library

1040
01:01:59,859 --> 01:02:00,549
me I said

1041
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:04,459
access to that so to what extent if he
thought about developing models are

1042
01:02:04,459 --> 01:02:05,160
standards

1043
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,569
for making real you know distributable
libraries or

1044
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:11,880
making your library accessible to you
and everybody else from anywhere

1045
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,829
okay I think I'm gonna answer your
question

1046
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:19,410
I hope but its its is something that I
already thought of

1047
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,940
not specifically in response to a
question so I may not hit the nail on

1048
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,279
the head I

1049
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:29,029
call the philosophy that I work with on
limited distribution

1050
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:34,449
the idea is basically is that once
project gutenberg: puts in the book

1051
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:35,190
online

1052
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:41,609
every BBS every guy with a Coco anything
else out there

1053
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:44,979
who wants to put that book on their
little system is

1054
01:02:44,979 --> 01:02:49,049
just D&D with me um you know like I love

1055
01:02:49,049 --> 01:02:52,469
linus falling sorry Mindstorm of

1056
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:56,029
sent real men don't use back either

1057
01:02:56,029 --> 01:03:00,049
you know only when she's back ups real
men put their stuff on FTP and let the

1058
01:03:00,049 --> 01:03:01,059
whole world download

1059
01:03:01,059 --> 01:03:05,940
he had the exact same the same ID I did
I just was trying to do with more stuff

1060
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,289
in fact I got a little story that may be
worth telling about that

1061
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:14,029
where I pulled an all-nighter I mean a
literal when this is where you just

1062
01:03:14,029 --> 01:03:16,709
wasted you fall into the second unit
with the Woodside

1063
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:20,400
asleep on and I did three books that
from Indian

1064
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,410
and when I put a min two copies on the
East Coast 2 cups and went cosa tu

1065
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,618
copies in the midwest and I went to
sleep and woke up the wrong one

1066
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:33,089
and i was just totally freaked because I
knew would be a week

1067
01:03:33,089 --> 01:03:36,410
before I had nothing to do that again
and

1068
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:41,109
then I got a wise idea after pounding my
head against the law for a while

1069
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:44,808
of sending out an email to a hundred my
favorite friends

1070
01:03:44,809 --> 01:03:47,999
see anybody download these before they
disappeared

1071
01:03:47,999 --> 01:03:51,989
yes I I was saved because

1072
01:03:51,989 --> 01:03:56,660
all our stuff goes up immediately and
people have little clock set all day

1073
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,749
long for people to back up our system
there are sinking every

1074
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:03,869
minimum every day saw it now hard for us
to lose a book

1075
01:04:03,869 --> 01:04:07,890
and the whole idea is based on the fact
we put a book up

1076
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:12,699
for example I did a icelandic book
called cormack this call

1077
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:16,940
and there's only one copy a bit in
existence is known I did

1078
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:21,420
I didn't know we gotta hold the only
copy I just saw you sent it to me and

1079
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,029
said here

1080
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:26,029
and I put it up there and I I woke up in
the morning I thought you know I didn't

1081
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:29,519
do enough copyright research on this
book even though it's like from 1100 or

1082
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:30,959
something like that

1083
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:32,490
and

1084
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:36,990
10 you are very high must change inside
your eyes is done I'm gonna wake up and

1085
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:39,970
I'm gonna see if somebody claimed a
copywriter this that or the other

1086
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:43,800
so I logged in and I did a search and I
got 1/2

1087
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:50,480
that Craig find it was awesome we were
already listed in the OCLC catalog

1088
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,760
so when attacked I fell asleep the time
I woke up to check

1089
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,140
we're now the authority on this book I I

1090
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,710
spun really is really strange

1091
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:06,660
amount list outside I just we are in the
same time I found out we were listed as

1092
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:07,500
having the best

1093
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,850
Robert Louis Stevenson collection in the
world and and stuff like that

1094
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:14,310
is everyone so I turned around and find
the weirdest dating reference the

1095
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,870
project gutenberg: night

1096
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:19,670
know me tomei their economy interview
before the right these articles have the

1097
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:20,060
time

1098
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:25,730
in his arms as did you know no just we
just did i do we get a lot of Robert

1099
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:26,590
Louis Stevenson

1100
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,940
I with apart the question was a about

1101
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,050
for building personal book shelves and
stuff like that

1102
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,550
that it can be distributed me we all
truly libraries and curation

1103
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:40,410
your technical papers and all that is a
big deal and you should benefit

1104
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:44,730
you think in p2p yeah nice easing your
personal book sale so so

1105
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:47,870
so we we haven't done a lot that won the
main gutenberg server

1106
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:51,170
is mostly what we say is look we're
really good at creating books getting

1107
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:52,430
them out they're storing them

1108
01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:55,860
produce basic how long information what
other folks too

1109
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:59,530
to provide all these these ways reaching
in that we didn't net

1110
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:03,210
yet dream up show you one right here
invite you to make others

1111
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:07,460
and mention that we also in a related
thing we we work with Wikipedia

1112
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:10,810
so right now we're talking about a loss
to author BIOS do

1113
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:14,870
bibliographies let's do about this book
there was a twenty minute

1114
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,960
we're not really set up for that were
set up for for

1115
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,540
like these big files that don't change
all that often and which are working

1116
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,230
with the GPS that we link to them

1117
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:27,380
and we let them do that arms s1 sorta
certified purchase or directions

1118
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,870
the other up on the screen I i apologize
for Michael's try so far colors here is

1119
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:31,910
a really weird colors

1120
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:35,870
but us know we got our study last gotta
leave you slash PG I sell

1121
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:39,730
that's where I made this image I had to
tweak it a whole lot after afterwards

1122
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:43,180
people make their own collections of our

1123
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:46,620
e-books and there's not time here we
haven't died

1124
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:49,790
result of people out if I seen this yet
but Tom

1125
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:54,300
they create their own collections right
so use like some some ourself in you

1126
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:54,920
publish it

1127
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,470
and then someone says hey I'd like to
get some of that stuff you click over

1128
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:59,920
here he say make me I sell

1129
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,180
and makes you and I so emails you want
some so a couple things that we're doing

1130
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,200
but I think it

1131
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,260
larger questions your answers we don't
want to do all that stuff going try to

1132
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,360
focus on what we're good at

1133
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:12,260
and we say yes you know we always
encourage people to do stuff course

1134
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,440
people's car oh well

1135
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,660
you know now I got work we also got a
15-minute warning

1136
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:21,020
sold the if everybody asks a question
only takes three minutes we're on a time

1137
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,090
campaign

1138
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:27,920
I just like to say thanks this project
is but

1139
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,920
also my questions about tax form

1140
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:35,170
I know you mentioned the I mean I I
completely agree with that with the

1141
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,240
plain text formatting

1142
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,310
how it's essential and you said you were
doing

1143
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:43,090
a little HTML to make it a little more
readable and I'm wondering if you

1144
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:46,180
if you experiment was with things that
are more

1145
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:49,630
for electing to pitch like attacked for
or something like that which is

1146
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:54,410
plain text by on has a little more
facility for page formatting

1147
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:57,420
and is is a lot easier to read in

1148
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,730
read the actual mark-up than HTML is
because all the clothes

1149
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:05,030
you talking to the wrong guy yeah hear
the answer is yes

1150
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:08,560
we love it we have 20 attack books we
are not dive since a

1151
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:12,640
plenty we have more voicemails I got but
I especially mathematical text tech is

1152
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:13,190
the answer

1153
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:17,010
I we're really interested by the way
this died Newton's Principia

1154
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,070
we really want to get news Principe
online at some

1155
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:23,809
bears a monster but you're not going to
do that anything about but

1156
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:27,800
attack probably prolly these days so
what was the reason for the choices I've

1157
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:32,270
HTML we don't use we we we encourage we
enable we accept

1158
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:36,420
ecology as a yes vote the way they wanna
make yeah we answer yes now the HTML is

1159
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,359
because it is like a great tools free
shemale

1160
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:41,990
successful you know all the stuff on and
so and so that's what we get

1161
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:45,399
when we change to XML will have more
options for spreading into further

1162
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,240
formats

1163
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:50,108
on but but tech as an option and then
we'll be some future stuff that's okay

1164
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:50,589
as well

1165
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:55,899
we got we got down 20 thirty something
different formats including NFL roster

1166
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:56,890
anymore and I foes

1167
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:00,470
okay no more thoughtfully of but almost
any other reasonable for me

1168
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,790
have done a lighting got with the pawn

1169
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:08,620
on all its again thank you's one of my
ex most exciting projects

1170
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:11,930
always had someone ask question about
your his answer I quickly there's a

1171
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:13,070
mirror how to

1172
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:17,108
okay I it's about 160 gigabytes right
now we do a lot of rsync

1173
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:20,770
and the reading root server which is
running this world the book fairs but

1174
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:23,040
pushing 60 to 100 megabits

1175
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:28,109
for two weeks as doing great job but by
and large I get your own copy the clicks

1176
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:29,210
on your own server they

1177
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,850
use your purpose is your friends or
whatever pretty easy nearing how to

1178
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:36,230
question if you leave out the human
genome it gets easier

1179
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:39,770
my questions about whether is interested
in

1180
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:43,710
craft instructional materials there's
orphaned

1181
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:48,990
books and magazines pamphlets from the
first half of the 20th century

1182
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:52,019
religious thing laws speakers

1183
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:57,180
publishers don't exist companies rich

1184
01:09:57,180 --> 01:10:00,350
never copyrights and then

1185
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:03,630
community people who say 0 but
everything's

1186
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:06,880
cancer on the project

1187
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,200
yeah just will help will help on

1188
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:14,800
thing when when people say that that I
you know we think this copyrighted

1189
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,240
whatever operate as I said unfortunately
we're experts and

1190
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:23,280
I am usually send email to copyright PDF
.org I get that and I

1191
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,030
will try to help out arm again a little
relieved that the other question we got

1192
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:29,210
sometimes format it can be a real issue
no we don't want

1193
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:32,590
we don't really want to have a test and
just a test for something like that you

1194
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:35,110
really want to actually turn into an
ebook

1195
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:38,389
that you can %ah I use for all these
other purposes River

1196
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:41,880
works cutting and pasting sharing with
want your friend

1197
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,640
printing if you want to that by the way
what we invention is one thing that we

1198
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,770
really think to say which is

1199
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:50,650
gutenberg from some the work we are
coming out if I use Google's Yahoo's

1200
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:54,960
and so forth they're mostly doing
picture pictures books throw CR

1201
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,240
we feel like you need a little more push
unfortunately that little more push

1202
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:02,450
is a lot of work to get it to where we
really want to be with being

1203
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,950
usually book the longer answer than you
bargained for for answers your

1204
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:10,190
with a picture of a book is not a book

1205
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:13,730
if I have a Ferrari I wanna drive away
in it if I'm up my pie with there's a

1206
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:16,470
famous painting a pipe that says this is
not a pipe

1207
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:20,890
under it and when people ask me why
isn't that Google book a book

1208
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:24,700
is because you can search it you can but
the most important thing is so you can

1209
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:25,389
read it

1210
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:29,370
and that's that is definitely the most
important part but it's not any block

1211
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:35,440
it's a something it's a Google project
Google Burke

1212
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,940
a arm I want to thank you guys for all
your good work

1213
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,960
and over copyright question for you com

1214
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,870
think we all agree that all earthlings
should have access to

1215
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:50,700
every book but we have to overthrow US
copyright laws if we want to make that

1216
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:51,559
happen

1217
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,570
um but is there another country that we
could work in

1218
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:58,809
iraq as very limited

1219
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:03,699
ya represent they are they haven't yet
find the Berne Convention

1220
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:06,840
I was turned on Afghanistan is the other
one that never signed the Berne

1221
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,880
Convention I don't know

1222
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:12,460
I don't know and Bhutan on the copyright
has been extended

1223
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,739
in European Union's lie you know to
70-plus

1224
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:19,449
Australia just that seventy-plus years
most address the world is life plus some

1225
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:19,909
number

1226
01:12:19,909 --> 01:12:25,610
US's fixed amount on again short answer
is there's not a whole lot out there

1227
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:29,130
and if you want to think in terms of
like God data repository

1228
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:32,250
types of things you already know about
Haven co and then you've read

1229
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:35,929
you'll see but the talks about that on
the problem is that

1230
01:12:35,929 --> 01:12:41,310
if I'm in the US I'm the infringer in
the US regardless whether they live

1231
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:44,940
you know and I now you know see Sea
Islanders and I talked to the ham & Co

1232
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,380
Chi

1233
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:47,640
you want anything to do with it yeah
they're bad with his little too

1234
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,870
expensive for us actually

1235
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:52,830
yeah but job but I said so unfortunately
it's not that good a %ah

1236
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:56,790
an opportunity are we we tend to be
really really cautious as I said

1237
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:00,330
are we have collaborators the project
gutenberg: sources Center

1238
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:03,769
is running this World Book Fair was
there any way is up

1239
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:07,890
are slightly less are sort of paranoid

1240
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,969
than we are and there are plenty of
other people it's a look public domain

1241
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,340
spells below to main OS

1242
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:15,640
complain that will put up for a for
download but

1243
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:20,110
that doesn't get us the the contemporary
stuff that's kinda perpetually

1244
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:23,639
under copyright it doesn't look that
good progress in the world but we are

1245
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,250
doing

1246
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,940
more and more contemporary stuff and
there's a lot of contemporary stuff at

1247
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,320
the world the book fair right now

1248
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,139
if you wanna see stuff that was just
printed my last couple years

1249
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:37,310
get on there go some other sponsors
sites sadly to say Jim Payne

1250
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:42,810
died while I was on my trip I want to
meet him in New York use he's one of the

1251
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:44,449
sponsors other-worldly Book Fair

1252
01:13:44,449 --> 01:13:48,659
and he's given site keep a box that we
can all give away you guys

1253
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:51,889
and Sun just no

1254
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:55,190
we we're gonna have their stuff I can't
say

1255
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:59,500
because people have made me promise not
to all I can say is we're going to malls

1256
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:03,239
lot more box think just

1257
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:07,469
as you amass huge amount

1258
01:14:07,469 --> 01:14:11,480
material what sort of solution do you
have for

1259
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,530
indexing for finding things

1260
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:18,449
funding any particular thing if you
don't know exactly what you're looking

1261
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:18,960
for

1262
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,480
well to go on to the to project
gutenberg: consortium Center site I'll

1263
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:29,340
that site has been totally crawled word
by word and you can search any phrase

1264
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:34,489
and find it in any one in the box anyway
like it takes for freakin

1265
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:39,870
ever to run then search and we actually
bought new UPS is because the searches

1266
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:41,309
were taking two or three weeks

1267
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:45,760
and that thing would crash sometime
during the two weeks we didn't get it

1268
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,429
done texting

1269
01:14:46,429 --> 01:14:49,920
take to make the index yesterday
endorsing a little faster that indexing

1270
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,710
oh yeah

1271
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:53,969
of our search takes longer than your
search yeah

1272
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:57,460
to build the index that you guys get the
search like that takes

1273
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:01,960
to three weeks and and finally what we
did was we farmed out to somebody

1274
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,250
its it's got to be tried we think like
them actually thought coupe

1275
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:10,100
Cliq p.m. dot org and they've been
running that

1276
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:14,219
so redrew .ms has been pushing I said up
to 100 megabits for the last couple

1277
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:14,810
weeks

1278
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:18,360
they've been serving you know how many
queries millions the reason we crash

1279
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,500
rebuild they grew rewrote the program
for us

1280
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,730
they're they're actually pretty pretty I
Google of course index is the name Burke

1281
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,920
likes we have a search

1282
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,820
for them Yahoo has a in a special
program where you can you like author

1283
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:31,670
title searches

1284
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:36,600
so I will stuff cataloging for books we
try were not professional catalogers as

1285
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,510
I said we

1286
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:40,530
we try to be some this stuff to people I
know it better than we do

1287
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:44,139
but we try to do a little bit everything
you know that we have as an RTF

1288
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:47,230
I XML file the download build your own
catalog

1289
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:50,889
using our data as and butanol this up if
you think they spent an hour on the

1290
01:15:50,889 --> 01:15:51,540
advance

1291
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:54,960
offline catalog page I could got work

1292
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,060
the hundred dollar laptop people made
big noises about

1293
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:02,190
rebuilding our catalog for us to but
they haven't answered my email since I

1294
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,210
left MIT's

1295
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:06,820
they don't know one think people realize
how big this is so you know

1296
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:10,309
a quarter million files yeah I got by
but a court you know

1297
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:13,600
out 20,000 titles on

1298
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,230
can be an awful lot their issues with
character sets languages

1299
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:21,350
having author names that don't quite
match we fix these as we get errors

1300
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:24,449
but we really I want to encourage people
to do

1301
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:28,989
probably a better job with you basement
cataloging

1302
01:16:28,989 --> 01:16:35,159
still finding its things thank you very
much Michael you started the thought

1303
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:35,650
that

1304
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:39,940
I'm not sure you finished and I want to
see if I can get you finish anything

1305
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:44,020
if you're talking about copyright
copyright stopping

1306
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:48,139
the information waves you know and then
he said

1307
01:16:48,139 --> 01:16:51,030
why they doing this are setting
precedent and then you start talking

1308
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,540
about the Neal Stephenson stuff and I
never

1309
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:56,880
we what okay pressed into the settings
okay okay

1310
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,360
have you read diamond age okay

1311
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:04,519
I strongly suggests everybody here read
diamond age

1312
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:08,080
anybody who doesn't like it swear to God
send it to me

1313
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,429
give it to me whenever I will pay you at
least have what you paid for it

1314
01:17:11,429 --> 01:17:15,090
and I give it to somebody else that says
I mean this is hundreds of people but I

1315
01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:16,030
will do it

1316
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:20,269
because I could never get enough copies
of it anyway same with daily online by

1317
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:21,190
the way

1318
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:24,790
it okay now the reason I recommend

1319
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:28,850
talking about and now you may wanna play
New Years or something

1320
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:33,050
II wanna mention a couple things and I
he maybe I should do this by email or

1321
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,469
warning

1322
01:17:33,469 --> 01:17:36,800
yeah this is a step in a spoiler
warning: but I'm gonna ask this question

1323
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:38,639
some do Socratic method here

1324
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:42,659
rather than tell you the answers so the
real question is

1325
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:46,230
why does it start with bod alva

1326
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:49,300
creepy low-lifes in the world

1327
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:54,020
why does it start with but when you can
answer that question

1328
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:58,150
you understand a heap more about diamond
age in the heat more about my

1329
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:01,830
what I was talking about in the sense
that

1330
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:05,739
every time people the masses

1331
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:11,610
can have stuff the haves versus the have
nots wanna step in and make sure they

1332
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:13,269
can't have it

1333
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:16,800
now I can go into the you want to look
up the history of fashion

1334
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:23,510
a particularly tally in fashion there
were laws so far how long your freakin

1335
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:27,010
toes on your shoes could be

1336
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:30,630
so that if you had told that's right by
the way that's why Italian shoes have

1337
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:31,980
pointy toes

1338
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,330
because it was against the law if you
are one of us

1339
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:39,010
to where the pointy toes it was actually
against

1340
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:42,770
phone law to wear those kinds a close

1341
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:46,280
now that we

1342
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:51,059
Star Trek anybody watch Star Trek

1343
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,880
my favorite favorite quote I got a real
tracker

1344
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,250
or Traci but there are some seriously
good stuff in there now

1345
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:01,800
on and my favorite quote is in one where
a

1346
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:05,850
wharf and day to find these frozen
people one owns a folk singer

1347
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:08,920
1 I'm sicilian there in 10 just somebody

1348
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:12,900
and the folk singers I got a whole new
audience I can go out there and do all

1349
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,199
this stuff i won

1350
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:17,370
the lady wants to find relatives in this
billionaires

1351
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:20,750
freakin per car Nicobar ship several
times over

1352
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:24,710
and long story short gets to the end

1353
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:28,610
and Picard finely tell some very gently

1354
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:32,620
that there's no such thing as mani

1355
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:36,510
guys about ready to freak out what do
you want

1356
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:40,230
nasty and Picard sense

1357
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:46,280
we invest in ourselves

1358
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:49,920
we live in a society where we are def

1359
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,630
finding ourselves by our possessions

1360
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:57,070
long as we define ourselves by our
possessions

1361
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,320
having the distinction between the haves
and the have-nots

1362
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,630
will be the most important thing

1363
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:07,770
and that philosophy has governed all of
our civilizations

1364
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:11,719
all the way back to the amoeba the
amoeba says

1365
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:15,520
it's better if I have it you don't

1366
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,830
that's the way comes now up until
electronic books

1367
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:24,519
there was only one thing in the whole
world at all if you could have as much

1368
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,159
as you want to know

1369
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:30,120
what was it very good here

1370
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:34,110
today you can buy any computer off the
shelf

1371
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:38,989
and download a million copies so that
declaration of independence I typed in

1372
01:20:38,989 --> 01:20:42,860
and you won't even notice to put a dent
in your hard drive

1373
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:47,210
me you can have as many as those things
as you want

1374
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:52,340
the first thing besides here which you
have as much as you want

1375
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:55,650
I bought that terabyte half a terabyte
drive

1376
01:20:55,650 --> 01:21:00,219
couple weeks ago for 200 bucks a week
later it was ten dollars cheaper

1377
01:21:00,219 --> 01:21:04,850
you now you get to the point where you
can hold in one hand

1378
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:08,290
and this is some what I said the day
that I started the book to death on a

1379
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:11,250
project gutenberg: which technically by
the way was July 5th it was after

1380
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:12,660
midnight

1381
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,840
on ice I talked about laptops

1382
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,389
and I talked about that you be able to
carry the entire library of congress and

1383
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:22,850
one here

1384
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:28,850
and I immediately appended to that and
they will make a law against it

1385
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:32,260
nunno don't know I was in a smart as it
sounds I'm

1386
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,940
was are you do read a lot of the stuff
that I wrote back then

1387
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:39,719
and I'm a Kansas Kat it sounds like I
knew so much more

1388
01:21:39,719 --> 01:21:42,770
that I really knew I was just on the
right trail

1389
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:45,949
I didn't understand what I was doing

1390
01:21:45,949 --> 01:21:49,690
I just knew it was the right thing to do
project gutenberg: is as much a

1391
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,000
right-brain thing

1392
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,170
is a left-brain thing for me you're on
the scene to the finance guy

1393
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:58,920
I don't understand I can't be the
circuit diagram because I'm Dyslexic

1394
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:03,920
don't make any sense to me I can read
code I can't even read a great

1395
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,050
it's too crazy for me it it makes me
dizzy to look at a regular expression

1396
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:11,889
but I do run command once I love I'm a
command-line guy rather than a point

1397
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:12,429
click

1398
01:22:12,429 --> 01:22:16,770
don't again I don't understand why this
all works out the way it does

1399
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:20,480
and run on a time when I said some
really good things here I would be a

1400
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:20,949
great place

1401
01:22:20,949 --> 01:22:25,580
in but I we always got more one room for
one more question

1402
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:28,620
the question is what is the website

1403
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:32,960
or web-sites that we should be going to
gutenberg .org

1404
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,929
gutenberg .cc

1405
01:22:36,929 --> 01:22:40,010

with 2 T's

1409

and I would be happy to talk to you
there's of

1415
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:15,150
50 languages Edinburgh .org there's over
100 guber .cc

1416
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:19,449
saw those are the those are the biggies
you download everything from those two

1417
01:23:19,449 --> 01:23:21,679
you got a major weapon collection

1418
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:25,239
but does not forget the Australians are
coming there was up to a thousand

1419
01:23:25,239 --> 01:23:29,050
and project gutenberg: Europe started a
couple years ago and they've got over

1420
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:30,090
300

1421
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:34,020
we've got project work in Portugal got
Senate Oracle question

1422
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:38,630
on done in age when I walked into my
senior professors Department or

1423
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:42,120
office in my department for the first
time I noticed there was a cop shelf the

1424
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,340
book is for the major touchstone so

1425
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:47,449
my question is when and where is the
first conference that centers on the

1426
01:23:47,449 --> 01:23:49,160
diamond age

1427
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:52,570
well I'd know the guy who runs diamond
age .org

1428
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:57,090
recent so if you email me ask them for
you

1429
01:23:57,090 --> 01:24:00,739
he's a replicator guide by the way just
case you didn't think that already

1430
01:24:00,739 --> 01:24:05,139
but %ah I am so far into this replicator
thing I just to me that replicators are

1431
01:24:05,139 --> 01:24:06,090
magic

1432
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:10,699
there there is far out there is my
quintillion box

1433
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:14,040
what about the the primer crime yeah
ladies young ladies per

1434
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,340
well again is the writers are right
brained aspect there's a left brained

1435
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:18,190
aspect

1436
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:22,570
the young ladies primer is the right
brained aspect

1437
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:25,420
and the whole programming thing you know
where she starred to start playing with

1438
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:28,639
the chains and doing all that stuff
that's left brain aspect

1439
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:32,760
and now that's nother of spoiler alright

1440
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:38,050
the end to the book to go what happens
at the end I i want to say it

1441
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:41,980
but if what did she become

1442
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:45,420
what's the result of what she does

1443
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:50,710
no she basically creates her own
civilization

1444
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:55,170
Sao you start with bod the end up with
this stuff

1445
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:58,630
new file I won't mean anything to people
