1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,840
we do they all have basically weaknesses
that you can exploit

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,060
and when I say weakness it doesn't
necessarily mean that there's some like

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,639
survey have you can break into

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,039
it means that like there are certain
ways to detect phishing for it ever

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,660
happens there's certain ways to

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,870
you know prevent nearing your website
things like this and we haven't

7
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,040
at a whole box full love like these
tracks but we can only have so much time

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,990
to put someone in this

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,190
I'm so what we gonna do is we're going
to attract what their witnesses were

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,230
going to be some case studies

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,440
are a lot of tracks play techniques were
you thinking manage you really have to

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:28,760
think

13
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,529
up this is not a perfect solution its
defense in depth defense in depth is

14
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:33,219
basically

15
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:37,429
you know I something for instance you
looking at all Creek you know pieces

16
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:40,730
from cradle to grave to an attack
pointer an online threat you saying

17
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,350
other weaknesses within each piece

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,370
I love the threat I'm any technique that
they're using that we could use to

19
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,760
basically come up with some way to
detect certain things were tracked them

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,269
or prevent them from doing certain
things are the reviewer fishing

21
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:53,829
techniques

22
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:56,929
I'm how many people actually know it
fishing is here

23
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,269
raise your hand because everybody got an
email from me that says that there's a

24
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,109
need a scam

25
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,710
I mean it wasn't for me I'm so anybody
that doesn't know what fishing in space

26
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,500
rent you cancel it

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,969
okay which is too far for I'm have a
basically

28
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:15,229
there's of four types a fishing and
fishing I group the malware nowadays as

29
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:17,770
Fisher because it is still the same
individuals that are doing fishing

30
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,360
they're also using this Malik others
anonymity

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,930
which is basically you near the entire
site you put it up just like it is

32
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,670
there's the forward which means that you
basically putting I see this with Amazon

33
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,570
EV see it where it's the actual submit
logins are inside the email

34
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,310
knows the pop-up which was the best
looking thing in the world basically

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,320
what happens is the

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,680
the real bankers in the back cover you
know basically in the browser so it'll

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,130
say

38
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,520
dot dot some back to calm and in the
front as a hostile pop up this is a very

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,920
good attack due to the fact that it
looks very genuine and then there's

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,070
keylogging flash form grabbing at the
real term is for grabbing

41
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,850
people calling keylogging but we're
getting to so

42
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,090
I'm gonna kinda skipper had this one
since everybody knows with fishing is

43
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,509
right

44
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:01,640
so basically we're gonna include

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,189
I am malware in here as well so the
primary the bottom part just to the fact

46
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:06,439
that

47
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,950
the main focus remains a website however
is bogus passed on set up to still uses

48
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,738
information

49
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:15,129
I when they're learning up sites and
stuff the sites may also contains

50
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,530
client-side exploits in conjunction with
Trojans

51
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,080
on this also includes new PowerPoint
stuff that we're seeing the

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,519
hazard a PowerPoint stuff is used quite
arm predominately for phishing attacks

53
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,099
I am and usually with Trojans botnets
another Mauer

54
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:33,280
oh my sup nice picture there

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,980
now announced as we go through this real
quick so we basically looking at fishing

56
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,480
our

57
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,959
ice then good portion of my days
examining the stuff I am

58
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,040
today's fishing groups are pretty
scaleable we're seeing a lot of phishing

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,239
attacks and botnets they're actually
though some other

60
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:52,549
the phishing sites actually hosted on
people's cable modems all over the world

61
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:56,830
arm but the main keep element that we're
looking at as we were looking at whether

62
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,120
the weaknesses that all these

63
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,170
what is the same pattern and all these
Trojans are doing well they're saying

64
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,120
off to a blind drop summer so they're
stealing the state and they're sending

65
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,080
it to someone its

66
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,540
you know out there in the midst of
something so what we do is we spend our

67
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,530
days tracking these blind drops and
getting on this data back

68
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,110
which we're gonna go into how to do that
and are average

69
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,230
Tom sizeof are fishing group but data
that they still per day for

70
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,930
one group is about between 100 and
sometimes receive up to 250 megabytes a

71
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,250
day

72
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,590
on average that's about 16,000 loggins
per day that are stolen from one fishing

73
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,849
group I

74
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,730
on average is about 5,000 credit cards
that are in that batch I am

75
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,849
since January 2006 secure science
corporation has recovered over two

76
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:38,750
million cards

77
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,159
just from our I at five hundred dollars
an average in california where we are

78
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,078
based on if the FBI has a statutory I'm
cost a bomb

79
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:51,329
you know the potential losses five
hundred dollars now bank you put it 1200

80
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,319
to 1500 dollars

81
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,390
organization 500 according to the FBI so
if you look at the two million

82
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,409
cars being stolen from G you know since
the beginning the year that a one

83
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:00,959
billion dollar problem collectively

84
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,340
arm and that's just what we're capturing
urs durst a lotta

85
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,579
unum our alternate you know we might not
see or something like that not I'm

86
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:09,870
saying that we'll catch everything but
we don't so

87
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,659
I'm here's a nice little graph I'm this
is just a sample love one group

88
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,880
and their their potential so on what we
have is some

89
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,210
system that basically monitors the blind
drop some stuff and so what we've done

90
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:22,750
is busy

91
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,810
yes get a stat we don't have a
circulation numbers from these banks

92
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,100
they don't talk about that

93
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,710
but what we have here is basically what
we started from was March to June

94
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,008
we started monitoring a fob line drops
and fishing groups and basically this is

95
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,810
one group carting group

96
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,580
arm and you can see that basically these
are the top banks are basically get

97
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,000
you know the the top target the cards
that are getting here

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,810
so we started certain these cards and as
you can see there's a very good

99
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,479
exponential

100
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,050
growth especially between April
maintenance about 50 percent growth

101
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:57,389
I and basically the card estimated over
four months was forty 07760 stolen carts

102
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,060
are so over for months at a loss of
$20.3 million eight hundred and

103
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,949
80,000 I so its you can see that one
fishing group makes about

104
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,389
approximately 5.5 million a month

105
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,350
now we're on our own business in time so
how the heck do we know this

106
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,860
so I can explain a little bit but we're
gonna kinda threw out one of the most

107
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,500
popular route it's out there

108
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,750
I it's written in assembly is called
hack store salsa reels

109
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,840
real name is actually a 311 deficits by
corpse

110
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,710
real name we actually know what we can
say publicly I'm

111
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,340
so basically it's a rootkit it's a
Trojan

112
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,330
utilizes farming were seen a new
advanced version 4.8 not above

113
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,599
are using farming techniques so they're
even defeating SSL

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,910
such things like that I and they're all
sitting for grabbing which

115
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,069
of if anybody does not form grabbing is
we're gonna go into that and so

116
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,319
so just be patient but arms can like you
are going

117
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,000
to steal user data from climate change
it's very popular by Russian fisher's

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,090
its old actually for about Tom

119
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,430
I think it was two hundred fifty dollars
in the has another version it's actually

120
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,289
sold 2500

121
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,318
okay so this is what the fissures seeing
I'm

122
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:06,330
this is basically this is an older
version but he has a demo version so

123
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,349
people can try it out and play with it

124
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:12,050
arm and it's a church in creation kit
they can actually get licenses a five yr

125
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,789
10 permutations by Justin save

126
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:18,150
put their blind Robin Hood and saving go
and then basically you know had a

127
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,000
permuted every time with the new FSG
packing

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,550
so go into that so basically you can see
all the possibilities here and the newer

129
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,400
versions

130
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,090
I out there have been a lot more our
capabilities in this but this is kinda

131
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,460
like it looks like the

132
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,099
no you know back orifice is the net
buses stuff like that but the actual

133
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,159
truth is a very good

134
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,319
it hides itself from processes it as a
very typical rootkits up

135
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,680
okay so they're basically sending off to
some on site now we get can lucky

136
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,699
sometimes not have an open directory

137
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,349
and so this is an older one on them was
a lot smaller this is actually back in

138
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:52,150
05 I believe know it's early 06

139
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,550
and so what with this was is basically
you can see log 12 don't act like 13

140
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,870
like 14 long fifty not tax lifetimes
when they close

141
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,819
there you know alarm have the clothes
director we still you have a

142
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,039
prescriptive basically into inference

143
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,539
and so will actually grab this data you
know three inference by just just

144
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,830
searching through all the dates cuz its
associated by date

145
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,210
okay so tricks for analysis so when we
get taxed for which since it's so

146
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,069
popular

147
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,879
our manners different variants of this
all the time good basic stuff is not

148
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,580
much different but the packing in a
permutation it doesn't get everytime

149
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,878
ones released

150
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,500
a virus company has to know about this
binary to basically make a signature

151
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,360
so you know we actually have a system in
place that can get a blind drop recovery

152
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,930
within 30 seconds when we re

153
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,940
receive the malware or your meal is free

154
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,840
so what we do and we want to show you
guys how to do so that you have to say

155
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,759
because we've done on the reverse
engineering of the actual Mourinho

156
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,840
you were saying okay how can people in
incident response or or people want to

157
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,449
do this

158
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,069
so what we recommend is having a VMware
set up of course and what we do is

159
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,530
because the way it actually hooks into I
E

160
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,930
I Browser Helper objects this one's not
around to help our tix is actually a

161
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,150
calm object and its

162
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,740
when I net ID allow win32 API injection

163
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,960
but any of that stuff basically if you
take I usually be haters which is a free

164
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
tool

165
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,210
sure i %eh is to basically kinda like
live HTTP headers

166
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,830
so basically will happen is you can see
all the harassment by

167
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,800
the the actual rootkit actually uses I E
is the agent to actually send it easy

168
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,539
use the HTTP send request a

169
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,780
function so what happens is that we just
sit there we basically infect ourself we

170
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,259
open up

171
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,199
I E and them first thing it does is in
it to the blind Robin we see it in

172
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,259
headers

173
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,729
I'm saw the encryption the world that
they have built into their I'm hours

174
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,220
really stop anybody we don't have to use
a theory or

175
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,800
anything like that are so we basically
within 30 seconds can locate the blind

176
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,880
drop we can monitor it merit mitigate
this because what we'll do senator banks

177
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,420
you know and send in their data so in
this was all we basically get dead on

178
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,740
arrival a minute they're sending out
because the average

179
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,370
fishing group does this come our takes
about two weeks before the start using

180
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,370
this data

181
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,040
are they usually do a setup like about
tough few infections and at the same

182
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,890
line drops

183
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,180
were monitoring and stuff like that we
return it to you know banks and

184
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,240
customers and such

185
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,210
and so what happens is there am you know
not not this is way before they're

186
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,350
actually using stealing status so it's

187
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,920
it's more pre-emptive instead of the
france going we're waiting for

188
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,610
you know some activity to occur are so
in this that case were actually dealing

189
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:15,890
with

190
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,040
are real time fraud mitigation RTFM arm

191
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,959
so for basically well we're gonna look
at the actual Mauer a little bit

192
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,480
what we saw in our analysis is that we
know it's packed with FSG

193
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,370
fast simple good arm that the question
that we have is how many non malicious

194
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,470
executed are packed with FSG and say

195
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,340
probably 0.0 one percent possibly due to
the fact that I've never seen something

196
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,050
that is

197
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,680
non-religious that packed with that but
I can't assume that I've seen every

198
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,950
buyer in the world

199
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,910
but in this case so what we did is we
know that it's packed with FSG talks to

200
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,670
image studied up PHP

201
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,780
summers in fact dat seven-up PHP NP sir

202
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,020
I love that you know for looking at a
certain group lot on will call a.m. CET

203
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,010
study XTM sister if she and it's based
off certain exploits cuzzz exploit kits

204
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,800
on and basically what we did was made
made simple bleeding edge Snort rules

205
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,880
and what it does is we're actually now
and we actually made a bunch of them

206
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,050
but this we will use these are the main
to ones that are kinda important

207
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,510
is what we do is basically we do for you
now we r look for FSG

208
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,600
I and so what this did was we actually
tried it on one of our own partner ISP's

209
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,470
which the huge eyes P and not only did
it pick up hack store all over the place

210
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,600
within five minutes against %uh from
Brazil

211
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,990
and in no false positives on this
because all the things I picked up were

212
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,130
packed with FSG any

213
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,410
on ended up being I'm our so on that
network it turned about to basically

214
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,100
pick up about 20 percent them our found
a network I am

215
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,620
so in the pre activity a pre-emptive
attack we basically know how

216
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,150
to recover the data but how do we
actually prevent future form grabbing

217
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,270
I'm you know such users get infected you
know the login stuff what if we don't

218
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,240
ever see this

219
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,330
disregard you know the the binary and so
you know we

220
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,330
we can save everybody so how do you
actually prevent this in the future when

221
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,760
our tracks which was with a weakness
that we can do

222
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,090
well we did was what when you know
something soon Art Awards where we take

223
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,220
it to higher ground

224
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,350
and so instead have basically doing pic
so inform Graham just explain this real

225
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,030
quick for grabbing is not

226
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,319
logging your keystrokes its own skill
for months now and even try to log your

227
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,800
ski

228
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,220
keystrokes i've seen maybe about 99
percent actually form ramming

229
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,240
and what that is when you hit submit in
a log in

230
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,370
your PCB header post request is sent to
the blind drop

231
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,680
so all that data is within that post so

232
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,250
you know as you know I'm scramble pads
and all that stuff totally stop that

233
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,640
due to the fact that it's gonna still
peace it is a proper post

234
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,699
and so what we do is arm we %ah set up a
thing where basically we exchange a key

235
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,080
acct basically to the browser the user
doesn't even know about it

236
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,490
and what happens we encrypt it the HTML
air so if you can see closely at the

237
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,360
bottom here we see this long string

238
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,420
the data still gets to the bad guy but
in cryptid

239
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,030
onto him so basically to them it's
garbage so that's one technique we look

240
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,640
at okay all this malware basically does
all the form grabbing so we can at iraqi

241
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,880
the form running problem rather quickly
forced them to evolve it usually takes a

242
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,910
good while

243
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,839
so you now we're gonna go into some hot
like stuff

244
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,970
I'm a lot of malware thats out there I

245
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,270
and fishing stuff uses hot long gone are
you to actually keep track of the people

246
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,069
that are connecting and engaging in fact
I and so we saw

247
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,670
Russian group using hot London are you
and if you got a hot London are you you

248
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,250
can see an axe ample

249
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:32,490
you know view stats page it would be
like to use that flash id: 2305 to you

250
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,230
okay and it with it just says you know
it shows you some bogus tax and

251
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,270
everything like that

252
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,740
the funny part is is that we have the
ID's are inside the malware inside the

253
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,780
phishing sites

254
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,790
and so for some reason even though they
have login the password if I put in the

255
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,589
ID that actually is I'm the the bad guys
I D

256
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,800
it doesn't ask me for pattern is
beautiful stats for that

257
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,670
so basically in this case we had
actually a case when the first fishing

258
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,220
nom

259
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,370
Target Center came out back in 2003 you
I'm on our banking scam reveal which is

260
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,760
on the security focus

261
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,380
site that basically we were able to
track down preemptively

262
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,390
the tester a week earlier I'm due to the
fact that you can go back and you can

263
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,680
look at all the basically the

264
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,330
axis and so what'll happen is you'll see
fifty like hits

265
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,130
you know how many times one user gonna
get infected by this probably once

266
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,180
you know and we're seeing 50 hits in the
IP just happens to be from

267
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,560
Ukraine or something you know most
likely that's the testers

268
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,170
so basically what happens we're catching
victims are using hot long so we can

269
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,300
actually track

270
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,280
you know the Fisher in a in a skit on
the scam it was doing I am

271
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,720
in the banking scam review article he
wrote what we were able to track a week

272
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,650
earlier some

273
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,310
I though this camp lead developer who
wasn't I don't squander delaware

274
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,960
shoulder to these russians

275
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,970
and skin to developers actually a lot
more in the United States because there

276
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,170
is no risk for them

277
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,430
and the selling overseas because it's
not technically illegal for them to make

278
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,870
a scant it's only illegal for them to
actually use it in front

279
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,410
so basically Roma find that we can also
track to refer see who's connected

280
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,540
all the stuff so we get a lot of stance
with the stuff and so we can read the

281
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,250
bag I stands as well

282
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,570
fun with our C I'm not gonna mention the
IRC server that some you know all this

283
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,940
but it's been a couple

284
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,470
I'm you ever heard a defining crew you
raise your hand if you for the defining

285
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,440
crew

286
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,870
again they were the guys are still knack
Paris Hilton to you about the rich and

287
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,310
if you for the Paracel never go

288
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,640
about the LexisNexis pack region and
okay

289
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,220
so we actually discovered these guys
were actually tracking virus

290
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,090
distributor I'm we ended up going higher
seed out too funny dotnet near pound

291
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,000
main channel which happened to be the
defining crude

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,810
also known as local route and so
basically what happen is they had

293
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,930
cloaking encryption basically you'd see
a user at some

294
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,170
you know this output here you look at
the outlook right here you too you know

295
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,750
some hexadecimal stuff and document an
axe which is just a labeler

296
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,090
I'm so what happened here was we're
looking at this in like okay now they're

297
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,350
hiding their IP addresses

298
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,550
so that the NRC which makes it very
difficult if they on the RC circuits can

299
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,810
we subpoena them

300
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,300
for the if you're not gonna respond so
basically I'm

301
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,790
you know so what we did was we looked at
the algorithm that was involved in this

302
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,439
basically what it was kinda crc32 very
an algorithm

303
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,850
ons is linear I'm he was a 96 picky so
so basically function works where's your

304
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,580
input was basically in ninety-six beauty
which was

305
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,180
basically I'm three sets a 32-bit words

306
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,640
and then the i-net dress to encrypt okay
the output looked like

307
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,670
to a C nine C three such as tough so can
we tracks pointed

308
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,930
so looking at the code here's some irony
that was kinda neat about it

309
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,750
I am we went in and looked at the code
we saw an area where basically they had

310
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,170
a comment that says

311
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,630
in n/a XX or going on and it said to
stop

312
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:39,280
you know crackers now everybody knows
what happens when it XX workers

313
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,630
basically reversed the operations so
busy they gave us a 64 bit key to deal

314
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,280
with

315
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,500
and so basically after that we did a
related key a

316
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,470
in a divide-and-conquer attack against
this which you know if you can talk to

317
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,070
me after

318
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,280
how we did it we have a paper right so
and so basically what we do is basically

319
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,040
then

320
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,050
reduce the key search space 2023 time
actually that came out bad on the power

321
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,130
points about that

322
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,110
I'm and so basically we did with the
reduction search time by factor 266

323
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:09,700
which means that we could break the key
key within five seconds on an AMD 64

324
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,480
so now we're looking at the same age in
addressing it now 82 got 54 at 1:52 to

325
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,840
179 so that's kinda handy because then
we handed

326
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,260
algorithm to the secret service in two
weeks later some leaders raids on the

327
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,220
news

328
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,610
so I don't know if we had anything to do
with that but they were thankful for the

329
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,550
other room

330
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,650
so now I am we see a lot of russians

331
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,760
I fisher's using trillion because they
think it's secure

332
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,670
is it has a secure I am feature and
trillion advertises

333
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,660
I am a while back is 128-bit industry
standard

334
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,990
encryption and so we looked into this

335
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,330
without reverse engineering we just look
at the protocol

336
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:50,720
and we solve stuff gone by we saw that
you know they were actually using a 128

337
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,070
bit

338
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,850
truly 128 bit primes in diffie-hellman

339
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,480
it does anybody know to be honest Jan
I'm

340
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,050
does anybody know what the number the
size of the prime city

341
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,480
really start with so okay so basically

342
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,500
the standard is group to which is 15 36
minutes okay

343
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,660
you 128 bit prime is vulnerable to a lot
of things basically

344
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,829
I the price the way they set their
primes up

345
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,149
they did it Sophie Germain they're using
a silly a library which are likely to

346
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,130
Sophie Germain prime generation

347
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,680
basically you have a 128 bit spacer
primes it's not that big of a space for

348
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,819
primes cuz primes

349
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,990
you know you don't have every number
your prime numbers I one you could do

350
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,140
cook prime attack

351
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,450
120 it's not hard to solve like you know
these keys

352
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,210
and make you know basically sturgeon you
still take a long time at the NSA's

353
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,590
probably got a list to the 128 bit

354
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,879
you know keys it's an assumption I'm not
speaking on behalf of the insect

355
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,260
I am and then the second attack that you
can do is basically an index calculates

356
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,780
attack which is basically you take a
linear sieve

357
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,550
and basically make you know you do
primaries one by my two in the basically

358
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,230
I'm a cop rhymes to that make a matrix
and then you calculate smooth relations

359
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,960
and you can actually solve the key

360
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,280
you know keys for that possible prime
set so

361
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,830
I'm and the good thing about this as
many fishing groups usually insecure I

362
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,179
am

363
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,960
another tack we mention here is
obviously the man in the middle attack

364
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,070
as they don't actually

365
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,889
do any kind of indication or
verification under signatures when they

366
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,020
communicate

367
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,230
so there's you know that's been broken
for a little bit actually

368
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,210
but Tom so we have fun with that as well
so it actually is happy

369
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,340
so I'm gonna let Josh go now he's gonna
talk about a botnet

370
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,189
you just start off by saying that you
can tell how tired we r

371
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,770
because lance is talking about half
speed anybody actually knows him

372
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,520
Anna and I can't seem to keep the water
from

373
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,680
going all over the place so I apologize
for the best actors of

374
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,780
your house is definitely a red eye
socket so

375
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,790
moving on but nets now

376
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,840
fisher's there tend not be the most
talented actors in the world

377
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,020
if they have the skills they would
probably be well hacking in making some

378
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,889
real money you're selling secrets or
something else

379
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,400
just yet basically so you know once they
go through all the effort to compromise

380
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,390
the host

381
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,650
well why not get the most bang for your
buck so they set up

382
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,730
they set up the fish they settle with
email mass email for PHP

383
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,540
and usually they set up botnets and
botnets work hand in hand we will

384
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,250
with fishing because then you can set up
a dynamically changing

385
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,710
website it's a lot harder to take down
so

386
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:22,790
oftentimes though because they're not
very smart not very good attackers

387
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:26,879
they leave their toolkit flying around
Ann Arbor fine but that's becoming more

388
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
more prevalent

389
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,090
so decreasing compromises for fishing
arm egg drop

390
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:35,330
seems to be one the most famous which is
a standard IRC bot that they've

391
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,649
simply configured for most purposes arm
higher offers another one to use more

392
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,690
predominately by where's group because

393
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,910
fisher's Tandon archery that much don
data on

394
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,260
for sites higher-profile more bandwidth
usage there's more likely that they're

395
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,140
gonna get noticed it taken down sooner

396
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,380
arm cool thing about them to you leaving
their configuration files it tells us so

397
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,180
much

398
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,200
you look the language but it's got going
in there okay now we know where the

399
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,180
planet they are

400
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,100
arm we now we know which language
dictionary lists we should use because

401
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,140
typically the password hashes if not the
password in plain text

402
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,040
are also in the configuration file on
just increasing your odds

403
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,270
as the white hat actually going
somewhere

404
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,210
mom so here we've got an example other
part configuration file

405
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,040
this is group really create room down
for brevity but you you see couple

406
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,220
things you got the admin password hash

407
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,560
I we've got some user names and some
berries French I

408
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,510
cable addresses that aren't you
permitted excuse me to take over to take

409
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,960
control the pot network

410
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,390
and I'm towards the bottom you'll notice
but the last three

411
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,150
screen names that are considered to be
admins are just at any health threat

412
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,300
wild-card hosts

413
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,390
which seem kinda silly to me because you
see you got mount was here three times

414
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,530
on he was very specifically want to be
the proxy network

415
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,620
but then he was also saying but you know
why not just make any network as well

416
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,200
so you know kinda sloppy buckets

417
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,820
move along and this is the actual by

418
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,020
that that configuration file came
through ran into a password cracker

419
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,110
using a problem

420
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,250
a French dictionary list found in
seconds we were able to then log into

421
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,230
the body was

422
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,960
always awesome useful information which
network we could find them on

423
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,730
which time a day they tend to be around
what type of system they've actually

424
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,980
infected so we're looking at probably
Windows NT your Windows 2000 a system

425
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,810
blue team is a French where steam that
is also involved in some fishing

426
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,610
in this case they were long since
defunct release we went to the channel

427
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:29,870
the

428
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,440
with your Blue Team there nor to be
found but noble googling little research

429
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,560
we found out that there were like blue
team

430
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,560
acts or something like that they didn't
try very hard to move maybe he got on if

431
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,300
i well

432
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,370
or throwing axe in there like I said
they're not that smart

433
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,070
arm so we were able to manipulate the
bot to find out a little bit more about

434
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,830
it because we weren't exactly certain

435
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,620
what type of excusable zur armoured
infected the spot

436
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,870
this was a typical 1x based drugs that
make not and drop system

437
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,910
pot through manipulating the botnet work
we were able to actually

438
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,960
change the directories that it was
looking for files to share

439
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,250
and we got to include the directory that
the ball was installed in so you can see

440
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,220
we've got some say when files in here

441
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,510
we've got various batch files if you
look at the dates on the logs 2005

442
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,000
arm had to chop off quite a bit but this
this house has been

443
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,400
only since about 2003 and I was still
online unfortunately so

444
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,870
of you know more people get online or
more likely they are to

445
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,790
not be the dumbest people on the
internet

446
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,200
our move on a little bit talk about
Google hacking on

447
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,660
anybody here that doesn't know a Google
Agnes raise your hand not talking about

448
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,540
actually hacking into Google

449
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,470
more using Google to fine born to host
quickly

450
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,000
and what we're seeing is an emerging
trend based on Apache log forensics

451
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,970
is that these guys are finding the
latest phone ability of the day

452
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,880
coming up with Google query in band
they've got you know of 1000 sites

453
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,960
that are vulnerable let's quit our ally
get in get out

454
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,960
I'm johnnie long good friend of mine
runs a website

455
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,960
John Ely tax stuff dot com moms actually
way right now

456
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,890
spend most my days on I should preface
this by saying the Johnny dollar hacks

457
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,380
that dot com is in no way a black
outside

458
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,320
and we do our best to try to this way
that image it's more about raising

459
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,200
awareness

460
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,770
however you raise awareness to the good
guys you raise awareness to the bad guys

461
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,790
a time is running this nearly 2,000
vulnerable

462
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:27,870
doors as we call them Google dorks arm
so there's quite a bit of places that

463
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,160
you

464
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,490
according to things to choose from this
is an actual example

465
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,120
I V query to be found in the patchy
longer for it was very very helpful

466
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,720
on title image view gallery which
basically means everything

467
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,180
in the title bar the whole thing's gonna
be included in this actually happen to

468
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,130
be from the

469
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,510
i think is a year and a half old
vulnerability for ImageView it was still

470
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,730
wide open

471
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,070
as you can see we still got ten fifty
are vulnerable hosts

472
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,909
the polls yeah I was as a this morning

473
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,920
so arm cool thing about this is that
number one we can assume the fissures

474
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,520
are lazy

475
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,530
but whether fisher's so odds are pretty
good that that most sites like we're

476
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,970
gonna be attacked the most will very
likely be within the first couple pages

477
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:12,330
this is cool because then we can scan
through them and then we can be

478
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,929
semi aware which sites might be affected
in the future so we can take

479
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,430
feel a bit more proactive unfortunate we
don't have the time or the resources to

480
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,360
track down all

481
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,650
thousand fifty these people and make
sure they lock down their boxes but at

482
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,430
least we have a pretty good idea of
where we need to start looking

483
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,220
see stamped its

484
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,140
you can tell I don't think very much a
fisher's these other toolkits camp 2x

485
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,990
arm when when they create the fish they
usually do beforehand the Riverside

486
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,110
they have everything that package it all
up nice and pretty they make the php

487
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,790
files

488
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:48,379
and these that the whole thing up and
the upload it somewhere band getting

489
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,690
unzip get out usually don't delete them
know

490
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,930
for whatever reason on the good thing
about this is that they don't leave a

491
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,520
zip file

492
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,960
even though we don't have access to see
the rockies P source and most times

493
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,970
you can still see the email address in
the archive copies

494
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,670
and its 115 down on them 20 which is
pretty convenient

495
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,140
up fee so the fish camp and I kind of
talked about this

496
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,660
is the meat and potatoes at the fish
this is pretty much where all the action

497
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,930
happens outside the exploitation

498
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,640
arm often traded on IRC and more popular
channels and

499
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,580
you'll see people like mIRC boy who just
make spouse these kids

500
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:26,980
industries amount for whatever you think
seriously because he's making HTML page

501
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,380
you know welcome to nineteen ninety-two

502
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,930
anyway so they're generally treated by
the kitties that have no real skill

503
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,020
however are summer be more organized

504
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,639
fishing groups have their own brand I
don't go to IRC they make their own the

505
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,910
run from scratch

506
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,400
and a cool thing about this is is that
aside from the ten thousand or wherever

507
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,730
they're getting them from MRC boy

508
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,330
we can develop fingerprints I'll attack
patterns based on

509
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:54,050
BB the way the the work for PHP the way
the punctuated

510
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:57,480
order to structure it on some cases

511
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,680
kinda funny I stamped its if you load
them in Notepad they look fine

512
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,090
arm but you scroll alway over the right
side of the screen

513
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:09,370
you'll see about fourteen or fifteen
more inbound mail statements in PHP

514
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,770
I've every person who would pass the
file passed through 13 min

515
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,570
okay soon as the files accessed send me
the email to send me the email to

516
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,260
so the fissures don't realize that
they're getting fixed by every other

517
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,710
Fisher

518
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,880
with had to file before them c-arm

519
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,820
scam please review without logging
process typically it's just a PHP mail

520
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,500
statement mail to

521
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,160
you know 0 cool at gmail dot com arm

522
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,840
but often times they'll also include
wrong logging statements which is really

523
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,090
really handy because

524
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:42,010
they're not only to reno who's doing it
but also who the victims were

525
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,680
and that makes a lot easier to remediate
the own abilities and make sure the

526
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,740
the damage is limited arm see

527
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,470
cover boats

528
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,180
some kid some are unique arm although
the ones that are on IRC a pretty much

529
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,010
ready to go just

530
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,250
out water artsy on uncovered

531
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,080
email drug the the email addresses and
the blind drops

532
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,470
are often reused which is really silly
by

533
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,559
fissures are creatures of habit so
they're not going to change our

534
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,149
techniques unless they have to unless ya
who shuts down

535
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:16,740
email address or unless it's just
getting too much spam

536
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,980
that's kinda funny her so here we've got

537
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,970
example are the typical PHP processing
engine that is usually processing up PHP

538
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,150
arm you know pretty generic this this
group looks like is from Mexico

539
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,890
arm and you've got a couple 392 a couple
different places

540
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,900
this is what I mean by I'm when they put
the covert mail to statements in your

541
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,559
this it's probably just saw a small team
that assuring email addresses

542
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,059
and I'm than it once the capture capture
your password

543
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,570
redirected to the actual bank

544
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:51,770
Aria Islam talking about they saw the
reuse the email addresses in their

545
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,300
handles

546
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,840
all the time to put them right in the
code so you know

547
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,960
first thing you do when you get these
things as thrown into Google

548
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,110
through my Google from a Google image
search and you would not believe

549
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,050
how often things come up arms think dog
even awesome presentation

550
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:10,450
I'm was Friday Saturday I'm slept in a
while

551
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,520
I'm not certain on it was really good
talk talking about screenshots and going

552
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,240
into what type of information

553
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,270
you can infer about the person whose
computer you're looking at

554
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,389
based on subtle clues thoughts

555
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,250
here we have example up one Fisher who
was just so darn proud

556
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,280
of his hand on his skills in his league
NIS that he posted his freakin handle on

557
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,139
his deviantART page

558
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,440
and then we got a screenshot was kinda
interesting kinda hard see well what

559
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,620
happens will resume in

560
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,540
all now we see who is friends are

561
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,879
who is chatting with on Nov you can see
it down there but on

562
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,100
there's quite a few exploits with that
in his shell

563
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,280
on his freakin deviantART page we've got
the IRC channels that he hangs out this

564
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,960
gentleman happen to be Romanian

565
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,330
happen to be pretty good at Gentoo arm
still not that smart kinda weird I'm

566
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,820
I'm still sue me that they fear that
they have no sorta repercussions to

567
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,389
worry about

568
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:06,760
so they just don't even care arm

569
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,480
you and vendors myspace

570
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,170
I swear to whatever D E is the you like
that yeah

571
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,100
we can actually see these people the
poster handles on their myspace

572
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,020
with pictures of them with pictures with
her family what city they live and how

573
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,550
old they are they're dropping

574
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,590
docs left and right I'll no

575
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,740
high school worthy live who their other
coconspirators or

576
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,020
myspace how difficult is it to TSI
engine up to had a freakin digit in

577
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,460
there

578
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,080
and Google will pull this up but i
digress.

579
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,300
an ominous entrance one back over the
lands with the legal stuff is more news

580
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,580
of order

581
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,730
not really and a sprinkle of skin

582
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:54,420
so you guys in whose involved in
implementing ideas in this room

583
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,100
okay thanks which companies just getting
I'm

584
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,030
so as you guys might know and in some
states

585
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,139
IDS before you can implement you have to
have if you're in corporate Miami have

586
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,900
to have them play sign of that there
where

587
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,960
that they are being monitored the
networks being monitored this is reason

588
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,440
one

589
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,210
there was I'm a California lawsuit about
assumption privacy even in a corporation

590
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,760
even though it on your own machines your
own networks

591
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,120
his assumption a privacy that goes along
with this I'm using an IDS in in the

592
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,230
user just wanting to be

593
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,250
you you checking his homily things like
this I'm now

594
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:29,360
ISP's also use snort and in other ideas
and different

595
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,410
detection tools I and so we're gonna
talk a little about about title 18

596
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,790
are you see 10:30 I am this basically

597
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,870
like the cool thing about civilians are
compared to and I know that every

598
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,820
sensitive about wiretapping and

599
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,510
this is a mean go around us wiretapping
everybody but in in the world um

600
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,740
forensics

601
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,679
%ah if your night P in you've got
someone doing stuff that's very

602
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:52,030
suspicious on your network

603
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,129
you obviously 1 I'm run United yes and
then you wanna start maybe

604
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,760
you know keeping an eye on it by running
to be dumped every night or something

605
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,470
and just seeing what's going on so that
you know if you wanna kick them off your

606
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,610
eyes pierna

607
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,179
now the only way I Spees allowed to do
this is they have to have a Terms of

608
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:05,920
Service

609
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,220
were you know any UP basic as the let
the user know hey

610
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,090
if I'm committing if you're committing
fraud we have every right to monitor you

611
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,480
and we're gonna do anything in our power
to basically chase you down

612
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,250
and a cool thing about this is that as a
company we basically king and a

613
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,230
you are requesting these I fees and
saying hey can you sense a hard drives

614
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,950
and we don't have a

615
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,970
have to get a subpoena we actually have
more you know I'm playing power than a

616
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,049
lot of times the FBI and Secret Service
in this case we don't have to run

617
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:33,270
through the red tape

618
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,889
because they've already got their
lawyers basically setting up in the u.p

619
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,690
that's very

620
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,170
diligent a title eighteen because title
eighteen is basically your lot money or

621
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,020
networks

622
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,690
on wiretap your own networks as long as
you're doing it for the defense

623
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,679
a viewer networks so basically what's
happening here his will basically talk

624
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:48,980
to

625
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,799
you know certain eyes be in theaters
this Russian Foreign its trading cards

626
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,299
and there's a

627
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:57,850
you know you know selling exploits on
your your ISP and Nelson to speak ap

628
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,970
dumps every night

629
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,320
so that we can investigate the stuff and
so we're actually working a lot of eyes

630
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,689
peas in building this up so that one we
can recover Data for come you know for

631
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,720
the customers

632
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,170
and the banks and the you know people
the targets are involved I'm

633
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:14,100
we do fraud monitoring for them it's
like a title three for the civilian

634
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,230
I it enables us to have a strong
intelligence for instance I you guys

635
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,610
remember

636
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,610
the venue to burp your web skylab or
iPad or iPad anarchy many

637
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:27,000
on is a Trojan back in 04 I are written
by the hangup team

638
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,370
and basically that was some you know
there was a

639
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:34,340
I'm few sites like remarks that are you
that would send you line drops in it

640
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,309
have sites and

641
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:38,690
and we actually ended up finding their
actual base camps as well

642
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,720
which means the base camp for fishers
basically I'm

643
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,130
kinda their little hidden dedicated
server that you know the

644
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,990
sort all their data from the other
scripts in there and they basically do

645
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,960
their business

646
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,140
I'm going out this is fisher's like to
log everything

647
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,530
even though I think you conversations
and they put that in there because

648
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,220
they're doing business and i think that
the report to someone

649
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,620
so basically in this case we were you
know almost every I'm

650
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,910
burp you blind drop there is out there
we were able to work with eyes peas and

651
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,250
get every single hard drive

652
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,320
they stole 113 gigabytes of data

653
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,428
you know for so basically

654
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:15,190
it's defending your network ideas falls
under this law if you are an ISP

655
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,750
I recommend in highly you know urge you
to basically start getting on board with

656
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,320
having a terms a service that is very
applicable to this

657
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,620
due to the fact that it will help you
and have forensic researchers be have

658
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,850
easier access to assisting you

659
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,750
I in phnom you know getting these
problems mitigate

660
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:34,960
don't include that then there might be
some form of implication of privacy

661
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,000
amongst that networks of you don't have
is there than you're actually breaking

662
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,690
the law

663
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,330
by trying them on to communicate exactly
is that the thought it would be a

664
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:46,740
it would be illegal title free so

665
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,559
coming soon thanks to Josh I ask amscan
0.1

666
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,260
we're hoping it's gonna be out in a
couple weeks hopefully let me just

667
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,970
interject real fast my code

668
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,049
really really sucks from this was helps

669
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:02,410
my I'm another moderator John gotta axe
the dot-com zelman

670
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,400
out answered amor the Netherlands are in
a Murphy and Merck such a great guy

671
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,960
help me from start to finish held my
hand and talked me into bed at night

672
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,970
basically

673
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,379
took the project in my mind and threw it
into coding base we taught me some stuff

674
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:15,359
along the way

675
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,000
so so the ideas can scan is the people
we have a lot of future ideas and we

676
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,129
have the basic thing that we're using it
now it's actually been pretty successful

677
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,960
summer investigations

678
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,609
on skint configuration file basically
it's you know Prall proved script pretty

679
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:28,009
much

680
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,760
ominous it has a configuration file that
you can basically had put in knowns

681
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,520
can't it so is your investigating out
there you find a scam Kate Lister things

682
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,239
like that you can start adding those in

683
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,760
I computing RC monitoring like you just
have in your own egg drop partner just

684
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,190
watchin some form

685
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,929
you know on our seer whenever your
listen channel you can basically you

686
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:46,179
know

687
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,460
you sometimes if you monitor girls who
basically see here's a list of like

688
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,560
sudden like banks can

689
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,009
no skin kits on a on a Web site to it
you know we end up putting it

690
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,490
you know in our config file and so when
we start seeing like an EV scam or

691
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,780
something like that like that actually
live

692
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,220
we run scams can on it and then it
suddenly you know infers does basically

693
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,220
I'm

694
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,560
I wrap a new rationing basically certain
characteristics

695
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,580
it life ends up finding log files like
if there's a a certain fishing group

696
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,420
it'll look for like Modoc taxed EMP dot
taxed lager dot tactic Nick to for

697
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,180
fishing yeah it's basically we're gonna
call it fixed to

698
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,868
min wetlands he did the name I so scan
scan so much more commercial

699
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:29,600
have but if you a free tool it's not
something where units GPL

700
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,850
I am basically the cool thing is that
we're gonna be like working on future

701
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,690
releases

702
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,580
are we looking into doing it too honey
clients so that like you know whether

703
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,000
attacker and a lot of the exploits that
we're seeing against

704
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,109
um the I E attacks and things like that
on the web

705
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,609
were able to basically thanks for the
music that mean I have to get off the

706
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:50,340
stage now think you can be words

707
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,340
fell yes it's your time to know I'm so

708
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,440
but basically we want to do it where we
can actually use that also I me

709
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,950
and basically a mirror in and pick up
you know we can put in patterns for like

710
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,310
you know I E 60 for a CGI

711
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,330
and the HTML looking for exploits within
the you know the actual sites

712
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,130
but basically we pick up a lot of scams
it's a long way which gives us the

713
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,960
actual email addresses the drop some
things like that

714
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,700
I am the parsing HTML to learn a new
director so we're gonna have that in the

715
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,440
future

716
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,100
I we're gonna do automatic nearing a PHP
source code through PHP web shells

717
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,420
and the great thing about like a lot in
this is there's are Milano nom

718
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,470
were seen a few I'm arm phishing attacks
basically what they're doing setting up

719
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,630
the

720
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,230
Russian c99 are 57 web Commanche else
these are back to is basically

721
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,640
and it lets them just you know not
really have to have rupert they can

722
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,879
basically whenever director there in the
control

723
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,580
the boxing go around with just staying
on the web and so we're gonna be

724
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,990
building a system that basically can go
through there and grab the web logs

725
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,660
I'll grab those things and and do all
that automatically gravel the PHP source

726
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,509
code to their

727
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,100
fishing I information so we can find
line drops things like that and to

728
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,980
mitigate the risk

729
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:03,140
shameless plug I'm I and secure Science
wrote a book called phishing exposed

730
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,670
it some pretty much everywhere Amazon
Barnes & Noble blah

731
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:11,150
I it's just shameless plug

732
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:18,150
thank you any questions

733
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,220
good morning good morning re: good
morning I'm great how are you

734
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,690
unbelievable thanks for asking I'm
awesome aren't we all

735
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,950
now one of the things I've been working
on I don't know if you've run across

736
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,490
this

737
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,740
is blog spam wiki vandalism

738
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,320
to the today tend to use the same types
the software the using different tools

739
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,260
ur

740
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,560
you seen anything that that might be
useful in stopping them

741
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,359
I'm yeah I'm I the which one is this
blog spam talking about block spam in

742
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,279
a week even all the blocks banya I'm a
lot of times you get the web

743
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,270
I am the web logs you'll see certain
characters is very much a scanner doing

744
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,920
this stuff

745
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,850
you know it's basically automated tools
and Dom so far from what we have seen

746
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,810
globally right now it seems to be the
same tool for most that stuff but

747
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,100
there's a few different tools out there
for block spam

748
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,569
it's like Bob Miller's right you got
since a few got I'm

749
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,190
dark mailer you've got the ms2 so
there's a few kids there's not a lot yet

750
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,280
for blocks p.m. but it's definitely
something in a lot and bulk mail is that

751
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,330
our standard out there

752
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,480
are starting to support block spam so
it's

753
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,310
you know good like dark Miller .org a
thinker calmer something like that and I

754
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:33,830
think the

755
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,119
even added block spam features so they
can adjust

756
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,390
fun I'll me the question was

757
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,890
what you track when these guys down the
wind up being in Romania

758
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,830
bolander Belarus Russia what you do with
the jump on a plane

759
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,340
I think they're asap no actually

760
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,619
actually honestly I'm only allowed to
say one thing about this

761
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,950
our company in the last six months has
been credited to 30 arrest

762
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,020
28 oven out of the country South the
other two are my family

763
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:08,330
on of real quick in addition to the bulk
mailers that we're seeing use the

764
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,080
standard excusable versions are

765
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,869
one thing that they're doing a lot of
PHP tax so there's this one seems to be

766
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:16,250
the most common called of doc PHP

767
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,130
and it's just a simple no frills
generics are sometimes people driven

768
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,800
otherwise flat tax driven

769
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,140
email on Miller and another thing is

770
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,310
in addition to the word press spanning
that you might see

771
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:32,350
were often we're finding is that it's
just Shino the seem to favor

772
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:36,700
week PHP applications or they stay on
top of the vulnerabilities better than

773
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,540
some other people who develop it first
income

774
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,270
Microsoft PHP know they develop hours
earlier I mean

775
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,680
the PowerPoint and other things no point
is that they definitely

776
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,490
computer ride I'm were actually one of
the things and actually

777
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,720
Josh were saying about the pews people
miller's which is a very high it's a big

778
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,480
popular thing in Romania

779
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,560
and more that there's two types a
fishing group sectors that we can I do

780
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,500
there is the organized crime groups you
know that's technically ukraine

781
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,680
Russian a stony a it can work together a
lot okay in Latvia Lithuania

782
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,210
then there's a chaotic group basically a
Romanian and their barter trade they're

783
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,660
pretty much kids that are kinda like
don't really know each other but the

784
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,848
tree back and forth

785
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:19,670
wooo Indonesia no rippers well come you
know that kinda stuff and they do

786
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,770
carding in the

787
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,890
you know the romanians basically we're
carter's gone fishing where the russians

788
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,098
went fishing

789
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:28,280
you know and now they're doing carting
has obviously you know track to stuff

790
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,210
but the thing that we saw like recently
a couple weeks ago

791
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,240
was that the PHP book Miller tools to
keep them anonymous is that a breaking

792
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,280
into systems

793
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,619
they did across i bulk mailing track so
what they did with a cake PHP and the F

794
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,490
hoping command actually lets you do the
HTTP

795
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,300
you know /url style rights to the nigga
text file into PHP book mailer

796
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,680
and they basically executed a nap
machine so the end of course the IP

797
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,720
address comes in from

798
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,400
that webOS you know server and it you
know the and let the guys looking as

799
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,290
weblogs is not gonna see stuff like that
a lot

800
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,619
to the Quick Add ons about arm you know
sometimes and down more in the trenches

801
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:03,750
the new are when you're taking care of
your money

802
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,390
are actually solutions at least January
arm

803
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,520
just standard are crossing click cost
like inclusions

804
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,530
and on everything from full on both
mailers to in some cases actual

805
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:19,190
back doors and I just include the PHP to
hosted on Geo cities account was flat

806
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,720
tax doesn't get interpreted

807
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,790
and many pushed over the other side and
on

808
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:27,619
yeah he's been saying that cuz he's use
works for the Tatty monitors that stuff

809
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:27,990
and I'm

810
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:31,470

I love it got roughed I'm

814
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,720
I'm good I can be a little late what
does PHP stand for

815
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,800
that's a good sex I free keys key
hypertext preprocessor

816
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,160
wherever workers have acronym sorry

817
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,410
to be hyper have

818
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:02,319
but is it is it with a different piece P
hypertext preprocessor

819
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:08,310
a person on

820
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:11,740
it's an anomaly yeah basically

821
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,800
with we it's rumored to be does too

822
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,030
an I get about two dozen

823
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,770
Nigerian scam military-type for

824
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:26,640
mom every day i doing I sometimes wonder
if I don't miss since MC

825

cemeteries film is the me two million
dollars

826
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,420
every I recommend getting the two
million Justin

827
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,540
every time I wanna quit work as I won
the lottery I these things related

828
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,090
somewhat to its what you're describing

829
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,359
act act like the email seige the fun

830
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,730
okay I'm one of the things that I did in
my book was specifically

831
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,849
not cover for 19 and I said I was going
to be for Nine's the

832
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:53,970
upon his games been going on since 1982
okay and basically it's been doing it

833
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:54,990
with faxes

834
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,359
normal mail things like that now
obviously email being the fastest way to

835
00:42:58,359 --> 00:42:59,400
get people going

836
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,990
I it's a totally different scam is
basically a stack-based fee scam

837
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,170
and basically they get you to basically
send out I

838
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,869
money before you get access to them in
which you never really see their money

839
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:12,170
they just keep getting you to spend all
these bank account fees and all the

840
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:12,770
psych

841
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,210
you know export fees and things like
that need to keep going in and the one

842
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,440
invite you over and there's actually
it's very dangerous campus there's been

843
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,050
cases ending in nineteen ninety there
was actually a kidnapping

844
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:26,500
involved in this new guy never actually
I'm return you know

845
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,500
no one's ever found him so he's probably
not live I

846
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,510
so but we haven't really watch those as
much in the sense a fishing trip

847
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,240
you know but I'm one thing we aren't
seeing those because we look at my our

848
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,040
data

849
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,990
the actual like the logs that are going
on we do see a lot in Nigerian

850
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,990
getting infected by Fisher's doing money
transfers at like certain banks

851
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,240
so we feel the Virgin abuse and i'm
looking at these up in like lottery

852
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,070
winner

853
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:54,740
these guys don't seem to like you know
care about if hiding IP address at all

854
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,859
you know in their music on slick you can
get those guys to send you pictures of

855
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:00,779
themselves holding up the newspaper you
also need the money but you gotta send

856
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,560
me a picture

857
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,799
but there is a 419 site near campus i
cud meaning

858
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,609
leaders yeah for when I need urs that's
more in involved in specific 419 scams

859
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:13,140
I if you get a phone scam that the rule
is the first contact secret service is

860
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:13,700
about it

861
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,830
I'm but you know they're black box most
the time for

862
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,990
you know cuz you know telephone has so
many phone its contract

863
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,430
okay I have a question about the when
you

864
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,549
initially starting secure science or
when for other people that are

865
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,770
not don't have a corporate backing or
some type about large-scale backing

866
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:36,230
where you could say with we stumble
across a wide rapport were doing

867
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,810
something with Mauer collector one of
the associates we find some true

868
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,130
undiscovered now where we reverse
engineer refundable I drop

869
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,420
how do we report that and not be a
target for a large company sale

870
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,300
you know we had the same problem
actually because we're not like the

871
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,190
largest company in the world and stuff
in it took a couple years for us to get

872
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,460
trusted with this

873
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,550
I actually got kicked off the entire
fishing working group because honestly

874
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,310
thought we were fisher's

875
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,259
I much data yeah we had so much we have
three terabytes a stolen data now

876
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,410
so so that the thing with this is that
now companies are being more aware that

877
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,170
you know this is happening as I we were
a

878
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,700
minor in our since 03 are with that was
done fishing

879
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,119
and basically what happened as we were
returning to banks and the thought we

880
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,460
were trying extort them like dude you
want to pay for this is

881
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:23,520
we obligate giving this to you and then
ashtu how we got it call the FBI these

882
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,480
guys hacking into something you know

883
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,770
and sell but a lot of the the company's
now our understanding that but you the

884
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:29,960
best way to go about

885
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,230
reporting it to them is one send it to
us now I'm fit but seriously

886
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,599
to is basically just write up an article
on how you

887
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,080
you know the process that you took and
basically try to contact someone whose

888
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,779
technical

889
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,859
at the bank ISS you're like that the you
know the information security department

890
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:49,250
so that they can have an understanding
that process I if you don't have the

891
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,060
technical

892
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,240
skill set you know to do that we would
gladly assist you in basically put that

893
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,950
together getting the right contacts said

894
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,390
are not for the kids were on the right
mailing list that they understand what

895
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,240
we're doing so

896
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,510
so that's pretty good scary I read a lot
about whistleblowers and corporations

897
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,840
a couple years back where you know
they're in the corporation's

898
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,050
expose something that's going on in
they're getting front door

899
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:14,420
fired worse yeah we've had actually
companies that we send them the data

900
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,000
and the wanna just like this I don't
wanna see it I don't wanna hear

901
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,310
minutes because the Sox compliance is
that they have to deal with

902
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:23,880
they don't want to have to basically you
know and they don't understand such a

903
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,020
customer

904
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,710
compromises but some the way that they
interpret depending on their facilities

905
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,190
in the banking procedures

906
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,790
you know they feel that they would have
to report this is sometimes they wanted

907
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,160
lead a blind eye on someone this and
it's it's

908
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,040
it's a very it was a very rough start
for us when we started doing this for

909
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,710
returning the stuff now it's gotten

910
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:45,210
we found the formula kinda make it for
easier for the bank's understand

911
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,920
I am in the A three years ago has been
doing this hearty come across Mauer

912
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,690
Korean foreign language

913
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,270
and do you have any lingering for
anybody that can help you kind

914
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,930
understanding

915
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:58,589
we actually recently I'm was we were
sending unit code

916
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,800
Chinese malware I'm had to have unico

917
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,099
windows and incompatibility I we do have
access to

918
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:08,840
I'm we have contractors and we accessed
through we don't have months several

919
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,470
times

920
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,320
you know will come into it is popular so
the demands a high now but we do get

921
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,390
you know a lot a Russian you know
language

922
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:19,879
because the Russian ones that are the
guys that are writing that malware

923
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,220
will write a lot in Russian comments
things like that and the Chinese ones

924
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,960
it sometime in one run on a non unicode
machine anyways

925
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,670
so it's fun it's obviously China attack
China attack in China or something like

926
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:31,359
that

927
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,710
or Unicode machine at least maybe Japan
or you know whenever

928
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,160
so but we do have I actually am I'm

929
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,399
have a few your contacts for Chinese we
have access to

930
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,050
Arabic things like that so so you know
plus we're on certain lists

931
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:49,619
that her basically have access to a lot
of people that do have someone that does

932
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:50,119
that so

933
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:54,359
you know it's available as a side note
huge influx letelier Indonesian fisher's

934
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:54,869
um

935
00:47:54,869 --> 00:47:58,800
the tools are nearly as vans are as good
as any other guys they leave all sorts a

936
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,599
code believe

937
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,880
IRC channel the leash outside their home
boys everybody

938
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,609
in and we go searching for DRC channels
and they're not making an effort to hide

939
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:07,069
it

940
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:10,270
unfortunately Google Translator have

941
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,950
Indonesian so the turnaround is as quick
as now only with a realtor with Russian

942
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:14,930
or the other

943
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:20,460
comments portland's

944
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,660
for retirement this setting up Terms of
Service if you work for an ISP

945
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,799
to allow you to their love company too
easily

946
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,420
legally give information to you guys you
you know investigate

947
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,190
but what me to do a lot of trouble
getting eyes peas to agree to see

948
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,810
I mean if you guys the file reno has
been years called memphis is some hard

949
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:38,640
drives we think

950
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,000
something's going on why would they do
that okay so what we did was we had a

951
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,849
private project working with eyes peas
confiscatory figure

952
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:49,060
ISP and it was free so in in barter
trade we would say we're going to do the

953
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,580
forensics reports for you were going to
basically do the investigations for you

954
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,848
we have references law enforcement so
it's not like hey

955
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,940
who the heck are you guys I'm so we you
know

956
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:02,880
so it you know in somebody's eyes he's
come to us and say hey you guys want is

957
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,460
data

958
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,720
you know you know I don't understand it
or this or that don't have a man know

959
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,500
that I'll a man who are the resources

960
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,190
so we've just diligently you know kinda
sided with the eyes peas were gonna come

961
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,070
to the source the prop you know not not
in a bad way that their source the prom

962
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,560
but they are what's gonna get hit

963
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,759
and in and that's where the traffic
CineStar so

964
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,280
on a lot of the times we just you know
some some of them

965
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,640
don't play well at all no I'm sorry news
Pena you know the kind of thing

966
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,270
and that's understandable and we try to
push the law enforcement ego hey this is

967
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,050
important case

968
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,750
see if you can do something with this
you know and we will write a report for

969
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,450
like law enforcement but in most cases
we've had some pretty good luck

970
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:42,950
arm and damn just a lot I was just
networking getting to know them working

971
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:43,560
with them

972
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,119
and basically helping them you know will
race more signatures to help pick up

973
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,960
certain type of activity

974
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,510
and stuff like that so it's free to them
if the service they get an inch exchange

975
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,720
they send us the information so that we
can help you know

976
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,990
get you get the problem solved now if
they

977
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,980
I mean I guess that makes sense and like
is do you get anybody that really

978
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,240
actually refuses and

979
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,630
yeah we have doesn't hurt you obviously
don't actually have the actual don't

980
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,210
have to comply with no not at all no
network voluntary thing and it makes it

981
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:09,750
legal

982
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,070
buys we gonna time that refused some
other the huge ones refused because

983
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:17,570
might just not care if it's not really
their problem I mean they feel like now

984
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:17,880
you

985
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,070
I'm I'm urge resisting the urge to even
mention certain ones that don't care but

986
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:26,200
yeah there are definitely one said Tom
definitely refuse we've even had them

987
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,140
basically denying the problem

988
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:31,390
you know like we've seen not like there
was one that I'm not gonna say 100 just

989
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,470
protection and they're

990
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:36,640
there and buy I we were found in phnom
router hijacking

991
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,060
you know basically what they were doing
is on these hackers were basically

992
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,839
able to make Newark tables and then
basically an IP addresses and stuff and

993
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,230
pick ones that are dead maybe

994
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,839
basically have bomb dark IP space and
they were sending spam

995
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,150
under da copy space and so we would get
like the actual

996
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,470
like IP address it's a DOD that's dead
you know some debt thing are you a

997
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,240
proving ground or something like that

998
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,240
and because the robbers were
misconfigured we told them how we laugh

999
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,680
to you when you said that mike wants to
take a look at these headers

1000
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,339
you know it's like is pretty legit and
then you go to last hop on that

1001
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:10,890
you know so it's so it's it's some
people it's any good

1002
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:14,598
thing to some for some people you know
how security is Okanagan

1003
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:17,950
in a lot of times you know even if the
ice be doesn't necessarily agree with us

1004
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:18,970
but we've got you know

1005
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,430
say for example just got working with
the ahu and Om

1006
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,500
they're getting attacks pretty heavily
in their customers are in danger

1007
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,839
well then they can turn around to their
lawyers and say now listen the evidence

1008
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:29,710
you have

1009
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:33,080
is detrimental it's legally ours cetera
and then

1010
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,220
we may have a partnership with them and
help them see

1011
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,210
I species you know it's in everybody's
best interest to cooperate but

1012
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:43,740
their customers include absolutely yeah
and one more thing on that

1013
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:48,190
so for instance a I'm bank and I'm
contacting you as an EIS penis hey will

1014
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,440
you help us get this till

1015
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,810
I love the I still say no that's ok you
know customers there but it's not

1016
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:53,990
because also there's data

1017
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,280
their customers so it's just like really
interesting argument goes back and forth

1018
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,550
between lawyers a lot of the times
because

1019
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,089
they're trying to protect the country's
but we're don't we're not asking for

1020
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:03,589
customer information are

1021
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:06,839
credit cards that were loading cuz you
know that only goes there you know law

1022
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:07,650
enforcement

1023
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,530
but we are asking for hey if there was
customer information can you give us an

1024
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,480
information pack

1025
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,580
you know IQ
