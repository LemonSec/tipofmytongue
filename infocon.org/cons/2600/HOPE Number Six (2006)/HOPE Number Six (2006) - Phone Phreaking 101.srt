00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:16,600
tacking is to computers its expiration
of a system

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,070
it's messing around it's harmless fun
its stupid phone tricks

22
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,619
and its essentially side product that is
learning about the phone network

23
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:30,030
arm the free phone call part yes you
know occasionally we do get free phone

24
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,710
calls

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,049
but its arm a side effect of exploration
in its

26
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,289
really in back in the sixties it became
more thing when you know calling Hawaii

27

for 10 minutes used to cost you an arm
and a leg in your first born on one but

28

today's rates in today's market it's

29
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:47,939
it's not necessary anymore

30
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,399

33
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,509

into it arm

34
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,329
I don't work for the phone company I'm
not involved in telecommunications

35
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:07,479

36
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,628

is

37
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:14,170

38
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:18,790
out yourself arm in if you're ever wanna
talk to this guy name logic I'm a fool

39
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,150
of myself stock up arrogant prick who
enjoys fame with learning something

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,879

case you wanna see must pay phones are
the Apple dortch way PL

42
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,609
arm so in order to start we gotta start
beginnings are going to history the

43
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,540
phone part 1

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,690
arm in 1876 the phone was invented

45
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,750
arm depending on who you talk to see
them you cheer Belleville stole it from

46
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,519
you Cheers

47
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,879
you know modernist on the way to the
Patton officer II don't know

48
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,879
II go by you know bill invented that
word his chest re says unknown to

49
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,819
rearrange whole thing

50
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,879
I'm in 1891 a man named arm

51
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,159
almonds trooper ER wasiyu I believe is
undertake your so that

52
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,579
and he was thinking that he was losing
business because people would call it

53
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,629
the operator in case you don't have a
phone work then you

54
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,329
pick up to receiver an operative a
number please are you too you know

55
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,870
or connect me to you know so-and-so
indeed

56
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,400
take your will wire and plug you in the
other phone would ring so

57
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,700
arms trigger was convinced that the
operator was saying

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,390
oh you know some Kozma all my uncle died

59
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,030
and you can undertake he was convinced
that the arm

60
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,120
other the operator would route him to
one of his competitors

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,930
so he sat down in designed an automatic
exchange where you would dial the

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,829
numbers and it would connect you
automatically

63
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:40,980
arm this was the base is a telephone
network can actually

64
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,120
he was told it to a couple he sold it to
just

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,439
I'll the processor GTE the manufacturing
arm and they sat on it for a while and

66
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,578
they had no clue

67
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:52,540
what to do with it and they thought it
would never Congress who would have

68
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,200
could want to dial the wrong phone
numbers

69
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,620
of arm but eventually was told 1891 I
believe it was in our

70
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,860
somewhere in Indiana I'm didn't write
that down on the 1921

71
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,640
arm bill consolidate all those companies
in the bell system was formed

72
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,489
many of which we all know and love arm
then they would continue up to nineteen

73
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:12,060
eighty-four

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,890
but more on that later army 1953 a major
revolution came about because

75
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,239
even though you could dial your own
local numbers who was still impossible

76
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,000
to

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,669
connect to long distance there was no
such small there are such things as area

78
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:24,799
code but you were never

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,070
actually aware them you call a pure
operators they like to make a long

80
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,289
distance call to

81
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,770
San Francisco California she connect UN
the process would continue

82
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,789
arm 1983 the actually enter introduce
telephones

83
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:41,330
I'm sorry area codes and you could be
able to dial your own a long distance

84
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,669
telephone number

85
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:47,070
on the 1964 a very important article was
released in the bill technical journal

86
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,919
that listed the

87
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,400
I think it's 12 master tones to control
the long-distance network

88
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,509
and they completely did not says are
completeness this and they didn't think

89
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:59,590
this would be of interest to anybody but

90
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,720
very arm you know engineer said

91
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,900
OG's I can control the telephone network
with the stone so let's go build these

92
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,759
wonderful little boxes

93
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,259
I N the blue box was born now how many
people here

94
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:15,620
know why they call it the box

95
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,229
okay we have one person so I'll tell you
items are not taking questions answers

96
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:24,318
ha arm Bell System Security I believe
was in the University Oregon

97
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,300
are found for these little boxes and
they didn't actually given a name yet

98
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,789
and in hold on

115
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:17,550
its

116
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,430
all all all alright where was I

117
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,069

arm in yeah they're very original there
much security guard what you want

119
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,259
arm in 1965 the else's

120
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:40,930
all switching systems artist up time
were electromechanical meaning they had

121
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,449
large moving parts in there was all
kinds of things in

122
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,830
it were all controlled by DC poses an
electricity in forty-eight wats

123
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,440
arm 1965 the first computer-controlled
electronic switch was dr. developed and

124
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,650
success on a new jersey

125
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,650
it's the number one yes electronic
switching system

126
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,650
arm 1971 Ron Rupert

127
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,650
rosenbaum wrote an article for a

128
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,789
Esquire magazine called the secrets of
the little blue box

129
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,770
and if you haven't read this you should
read it's just a fun article in general

130
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,990
arm I have saved on my hard drive
actually and it's always fun to pop it

131
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,629
up on a board

132
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,180
arm and this really put freaking into
the mainstream

133
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,409
everyone suddenly said wow I can get
free phone calls in

134
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:24,039
arm there was bells side look at this
and say

135
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,229
move this is bad we should start
arresting these people in which was a

136
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,610
week started off as a minor annoyance

137
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,270
on actually Russian into a major toll
for a test escapade

138
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,380
so they actually started cracking down
on everything in certain people went to

139
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,289
jail

140
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:46,289
yes one of which is right here stand up
I don't think anyone I don't think so me

141
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,500
up

142
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:14,858
yes

143
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:18,189
offer those your didn't actually hear
the whole thing arm

144
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:22,059
one of the major problems was there is a
telex test circuit in

145
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:27,059
Vancouver Vancouver yes 604 2111 it was
only die with your blue boxes

146
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,499
and it was going to be cut over from
single frequency which was

147
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:33,919
2600 arm pulses to

148
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,529
MF which is what control toolbox and
know everyone side get on

149
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:41,720
and everyone kinda noticed it and said
who why are all these people testing the

150
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,399
Teluk circuit know once was to be on
here

151
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,619
and so they actually that's the other
thing the kind o let everything

152
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:53,100
he traced everybody back it's a missing
in

153
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,319
now they're quick arm it two weeks they
formed a grand jury investigation

154
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:01,929
army 1984 arm Bell was broken up by the
federal government

155
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:05,209
and the broder into how come

156
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,019
on I dude bill was a very romantic thing

157
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:13,989
in your moving back to it I'm a
telephone guy I find I find you know

158
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,169
telephone system from into

159
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:19,009
it was a broken up welshman my wife

160
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,850
arm it was broken up into seven regional
bell operating companies and actually

161
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,259
have this beautiful map right here but
not if you can see it to read the labels

162
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,139
which I hand-drawn myself

163
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,139
but I am so yes was broken up into seven
companies

164
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,149
are there's actually two cause I
companies are

165
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:40,399
cincinnati bell in southern New England
Telephone Company which was our

166
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,730
Connecticut if arm

167
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,699
and they were not owned completely by
the Bell System so there its or their

168
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:49,160
own

169
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,189
independent thing back in 1984 arm

170
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:55,660
so everything took 100 along to about
1997 when there wasn't

171
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,289
orgia acquisition I was going to say
that arm

172
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:04,019
in 1997 arsov southwestern bell
corporation otherwise known as SBC

173
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,079
are by specific tells us which was in
charge of California

174
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,689
and Nevada you actually see this for
have my map but um

175
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:15,579
night 97 also a nynex and bell atlantic
merging became

176
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,689
billed later careerism arm then

177
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:23,730
SBC goes on buying rampage in SPC bizar
southern New England Telephone 1998 in

178
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,720
1989 by

179
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,879
Ameritech which was the a midwestern
Upper Peninsula sheesh

180
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,169
illinois' and all that stuff arm

181
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,389
in 2000 a quest was the

182
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,329
I believe there were fire up the company
and they had lots of money due to the

183
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:43,209
dot-com boom they said she lets go by
telephone company and

184
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:46,339
initiated a hostile takeover of US west
which was a

185
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,769
a really bad things US was really was a
good telephone company in the

186
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:53,769
they were the first roll caller ID and
DSL

187
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:57,110
a lot of stuff in quest is now in the
hole for about

188
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,179
seen amount of money in is teetering on
bankruptcy are also in 2000 our bell

189
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:07,110
atlantic buys GTE GTE was eighty largest
independent in the United States

190
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,079
arm they really don't have a general
area where they serve there all over the

191
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,089
place they bought a little small
companies are

192
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,100
back even in the nineteen sixties when
Bell was around

193
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,499
arm Sobell that it bought them and
became

194
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:23,850
rise in which is truth in her up ferret
arson horizon

195
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,819
some marketing major was paid lots a
bite figure that out arm in 2002

196
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:32,759
the a I can't remember when the SEC made
the declaration that

197
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:36,860
electrical mechanical switches had to go
I don't know the exact year

198
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,049
but in 2002 the lest last electro
mechanical switch was a small step

199
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,730
in a small town called not quebec. are
was retired

200
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,489
not quebec. and a its Quebec its French
then on Sprint announcer feeler

201
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:54,720
are n/a n t'es be able see this other
hand I think arm

202
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,869
in 2005 you probably remember those SBC
buys AT&T

203
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:03,199
and fries and also buys MCI because they
don't want to be caught with their pants

204
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:03,769
down

205
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:08,980
armand so SBC is now known as AT&T are
silent economist bc&d

206
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,039
arm in 2006 are AT&T

207
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,909
are they actually this just happened
what is the announce a while ago but

208
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,839
this shareholders just approved
yesterday

209
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
arm SPC for AT&T in this case Baez Bill
Self's another known as

210
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,059
SBC NT South arm and also in 2006 I give
this presentation

211
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:34,059
arm yes

212
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:37,519
and that'll happen we combo I'm actually
have protection

213
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,019
arm right now there are three major
telephone companies left there's a rise

214
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:43,039
in which is nine expel them tick

215
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,809
arm and GTE which is all over the place
in little pockets

216
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:51,240
arm quest which is essentially the
midwest the mountains

217
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,289
on the at Midwest Mountain States arm
you min all the way over Minnesota in

218
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:56,789
all the way over to Washington

219
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:01,220
and then there's SBC which is everything
else arm you can see my little nap again

220
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,549
which I did by hand but you know you can
see it

221
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:08,699
actually disconnect is in turnaround 92

222
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:13,579
even just in case okay over technical
support people are working around the

223
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:15,860
clock

224
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,059
arm so anyway like I said they're
screaming baby bells request which is US

225
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:19,679
west

226
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,110
are AT&T which southwestern bell
corporation pacific telesis

227
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,679
Ameritech in BellSouth and rise in which
is billed later nynex in GT

228
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,490
on there's a dwindling number of
independent are what they call I left

229
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,350
which is independent local exchange
carriers which was

230
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,309
a term formed in 1996 when they were
fleeced as Telecommunications Act of

231
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,549
1996 was

232
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,769
complete bullshit but arm

233
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,179
if they're personally being called up by
the people are just being folded

234
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:49,289
arm there's now also something called
see less which are competitive local

235
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,549
exchange carriers and if you ever want
to set up a telephone company

236
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:56,659
this is what you do you anyone can be a
sea loch i've seen. seal extended power

237
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,529
companies

238
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,689
see light switcher cable companies see
let switcher just

239
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:07,219
bloody everything arm I my parents have
phone from Comcast it is the worst thing

240
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,449
ever they can the date they say oh yeah
our phone company what they are is a

241
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:12,579
VoIP company

242
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,179
in for those who don't know VoIP voice
over IP on they can all use one phone at

243
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,419
the same time

244
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:21,559
else the audio drops down to nothing and
this is essentially what's your looks

245
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:25,368
are there fly by night companies for the
most part there's a couple good ones

246
00:15:25,369 --> 00:15:28,740
arm mmm

247
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:35,019
try again okay

248
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,030
nope

249
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,550
blue screen of death now arm and

250
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,930
arm essentially would I think it could
be me so just your

251
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:50,850
artistry do so to forget about arm
anyway what was now phones is now in

252
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,100
this

253
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,530
wonderful thing called
telecommunications and everything is

254
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,970
telecommunications it's your new waiver
thing in

255
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,900
it sounds good on market reports and for
the stock market people Aug anyway so

256
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,000
phones 101 and I have this wonderful
graphics

257
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,630
up showing how a phone call goes thru
its kinda been

258
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:15,130
what I have a laptop but it's not going
up to the projector

259
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,710
that slides will be on the internet I
just don't have it right now

260
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:25,570
because I thought this would work I'm
terribly sorry it's it's

261
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,710
resolution the resolution is look no

262
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,610
anyway for those who don't see those
anyway

263
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,670
so say for example we are going to call

264
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,220
eight number in are very sorry
discussing everything so

265
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,780
arm say for example we are calling a
phone number in California which is

266
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,319
awesome

267
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,770
one of my friends from Carlson favor
number Gladstone for fish two fish

268
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,240
restaurant near phone number

269
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,710
back in the day was GO FOR fash so I
pick up the phone

270
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,570
and actually see few

271
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:07,200
I was hit dialing with words

272
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,830
I'm a numbers personal I say

273
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:19,199
hope

274
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,240
okay so there's what happened in that
short amount of time

275
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,839
gonna talk to a woman who I want to say
your super fruits at 9 a.m. over there

276
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,629
they're all sleeping

277
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,800
arm anyway so what happened was this
phone actually went through a small PBX

278
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,320
probably at the hotel Pennsylvania

279
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,070
which is connected to a number five
electronic switching system

280
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,740
arm the address I forget somewhere in
the general vicinity

281
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,210
38th and sup 3 A's and some

282
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,810
somewhere between seven eighths you can
go down there and check it out yourself

283
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,899
arm

284
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,640
that was connected probably likely to
AT&T which is has a large building

285
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,430
downtown

286
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,800
yes Wall Street arm

287
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,720
anyway I was probably connected via %uh
we're connected to the switch probably

288
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,980
by 81 yr couple are more than a few key
ones cuz original art reservoir to tell

289
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,090
on the 5e assessor property next to each
and he probably by either OC

290
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,590
says a 96 Manohar what I have written
down here

291
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,120
well probably in OC 12 over No c3

292
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,570
other number forty SS which is what AT&T
downtown has a

293
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,409
link probably directly to los angeles ca
two major switching destination

294
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,690
which is probably go see 96 out as
another in

295
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,670
number forty assess located in downtown
Los Angeles arm

296
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,990
also owned by AT&T now are from there
they probably connected to a number

297
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,550
another number five yeses cuz AT&T likes
five years this is because they made

298
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:40,909
them

299
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,010
arm which was a local routing
destination

300
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,270
at which point if I V SS connected to
any fries Inc

301
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,810
us which which is 85 arm which was
connected directly to

302
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,159
jail for fich and their phone rang and
arm

303
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,680
that was a bunch of data packets and
couldn't wake him up Oaks

304
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,520
yeah I called I love you

305
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,840
arm

306
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,909
it was probably go to a I'll smoke for
copper in the phone right now all of

307
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:12,430
this

308
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,900
used to be done by in been signaling
which was all kinds abuses which is

309
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,990
everything but essentially

310
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,270
what this is right now is a giant data
network arm just all optical carrier

311
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,450
individual carrier

312
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,030
which was a bunch of flying package
called which just part is the signaling

313
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,790
system 7

314
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,710
arm Anders once called I am. which
initial

315
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,550
action message was flies across and
connects everything up so

316
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,379
that happens all split-second arm

317
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,010
now an hour talking about five years a
schism for reassess is one he assesses

318
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,280
arm a number one or number one ADSs

319
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,149
is up everything all these with the SS
is our were made by Lucent

320
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,140
which was formally Western Electric
armor one USSR when he assesses the last

321
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,530
are electrical mechanical switch their
it's technically got the FCC

322
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,970
jaws of death up because it was
computer-controlled

323
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,330
that's what they focused on on there's
only a few left mainly if you're from

324
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,340
Chicago and you go down to your

325
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,459
more a scary areas a strong put it

326
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,130
on you can still hear it you can arm
hero has a nice click sync lungs when

327
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,190
you call somebody

328
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,330
its is as opposed to a electronic system
like a

329
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,419
number five which is just very subtle
you mean cuz there's no

330
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,900
switches been click back and forth on
the number four reassess

331
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,790
is the backbone 18 she's telephone
network all their long distance which is

332
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,810
our number forty assesses

333
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:38,480
arm thats in actually they used to be
just for long distance but ever since he

334
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,080
kinda started poking into

335
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,460
before the SBC merger they started
poking in the local areas and actually

336
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,390
stirring tale toons offer them

337
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,260
arm I think they've I don't know
actually to be completely honest with

338
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,070
you either for wire to wire

339
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,120
that's the only two options yes arm

340
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,370
number five USS is exactly only for and
office uses the occasionally put the kid

341
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,960
are ones for switching here in their
butts mostly

342
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,430
they serve your dial tone to when you
pick it up your own a number five USS

343
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,530
arm if you're your if you pick it up to
probably a number five USS

344
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,700
if you have AT&T or arm

345
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,780
lot of the older equipment arm GTE

346
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,389
which was now Verizon they have an image
manufacturing they had a manufacturing

347
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,790
arm in automatic electric

348
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,980
and they developed a digital switch arm
called the gt5

349
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:32,120
and comments for and office use only
note all capabilities whatsoever for

350
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,100
tendering

351
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,490
arm and its a very

352
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,880
its it's a weird switch it does all
kinds on things like

353
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,430
for example if you ever spoof caller ID
on you can actually

354
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,850
set your name and the GTD 5 trusted
blindly

355
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,940
doesn't actually look up who's calling
who officially is assigned a number so

356
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,780
I could some send you know anything
saying you know Bart Simpson

357
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,649
calling from the white house in it'll
blindly trust

358
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,830
arm Nortel which is a Northern Telecom
which is our Canadian

359
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,639
company are they make a lot of switches
that I believe rice is trying to move a

360
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,410
lot to this team is 500

361
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,740
which Verizon really doesn't use arm

362
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,360
plus he looks for purchasing it it does
our tandem end of seeing it does long

363
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,890
distance it does

364
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,020
arm something called UPnP which is our

365
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,620
allowing other phone companies a set of
your switch and you know you can charge

366
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,780
them for that its

367
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,480
part of the arm you know
telecommunications act back then when

368
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,100
you had to have all the seal X

369
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,660
arm it does everything suck your dishes
RDMs 200 which

370
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,140
is are mostly for tiananmen use
occasionally you see it in

371
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,570
and offices well for large communities

372
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,139
arm the asx200 you something called tops
which is a tool offering to sing system

373
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,770
which is arm operator positions and
that's one is the

374
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,110
it's the only currently are new
manufactured solution for operators

375
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,160
right now

376
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,240
rTMS 100 is in and office which

377
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,150
only its what controls your dial tone
also the something called smaller which

378
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,170
is DMS 10 which is for

379
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:06,950
you know put up Arizona who only has
about five min customers but wants to

380
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,660
really have a new switch

381
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,080
arm if you ever wanna make your own
phone company you have no five thousand

382
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,699
dollars that's a switch for you

383
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,760
arm will skip that such as the table
when you need to see that

384
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,470
basically it's also kinda switches and
various numbers very wanna see how many

385
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,970
are

386
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,660
if you're ever wanna will your mind see
how many of which conversations in OC 96

387
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,350
can handle

388
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,860
just look it up it's like OC 96 will

389
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,670
Terry asaro c48 will carry 32256
simultaneous voice conversations

390
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,560
which and OC 768 when you start talking
about major backbones

391
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,750
carries on with the five hundred and
sixteen thousand conversations all

392
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,820
won simultaneously no

393
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,860
am so anyway now they were taught talked
about old telephone network in aboard

394
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,510
yourself silly let's go talk by phone
freaking

395
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,850
every so first let's talk about our
friend the operator

396
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,650
arm

397
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:10,650
its function FA for me way

398
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:21,150
up

399
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:33,190
essential time whatever thanks a lot of
our friend the operator

400
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,039
arm something called of diverting which
essentially cop

401
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,940
0 no XO there for a sec come

402
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,469
yeah its function f eight I know how to

403
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:48,679
and apparently it's probably cuz its 1x
1x Ochsner

404
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,019
are yeah I just said it tonight um
anyway so there's something called

405
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:56,489
of diverting which essentially calling
the operator in getting the dial in

406
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:58,159
number for you what that does

407
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,959
it looks like the phone call is coming
from them which block your caller ID

408
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,149
and arm adds another step 4:

409
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:10,229
if someone to try to trace it back arm
in also usually block something called

410
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:11,999
calling party number which is something

411
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:15,399
are Morden down in the actual signaling
network

412
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:19,619
arm for it's a basically super caller ID
in the way to do it

413
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,969
arm there's two is one way of doing it
which is basically saying

414
00:25:22,969 --> 00:25:26,719
I'm special or I'm blind or I'm you
actually can sometimes a

415
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:30,289
I'm definitely 00 although that number
for you arm

416
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:33,389
another's wait just a Mesaba story
saying

417
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:37,479
I call them up one day and actually said
0 I'm having trouble dialing 800 number

418
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:41,429
on the button is stuck on this pay phone
she said okay let me tell it for you no

419
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:43,959
problem it went right through unblock my
caller ID

420
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:49,409
arm just it's as is a it's a nice basic
wave just practicing social engineering

421
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:52,940
arm they can also route you to the carry
for choice just call me up and say hey

422
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,619
i'd like to use you know Joe Blow a long
distance company

423
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:59,479
and day will route you to it because
that's what they have to do calling

424
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:00,349
federal law

425
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:04,309
arm some coin phones namely Verizon

426
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:08,869
I think also SBC does it blocks local
operators if you press 0 it'll die so

427
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:12,469
for fries at least much order arm SBC NT
South those

428
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:15,839
arm daschle dials a number in Texas

429
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,539
into its they cannot do all this one of
stuff to you so you have to buy past

430
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:21,899
firmware somewhere arm

431
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:25,690
there's a couple ways of doing this arm
one of which is and trying to block your

432
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,259
caller ID on a pay phone which

433
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:30,869
actually sums which is pretty you arm I
believe

434
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:34,469
are royal are you here royal

435
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:37,529
Royals going to write an article on this
at some point and tell you all the

436
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,329
wonderful things he did a lotta Research
Forum

437
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:45,549
and is really nice guy arm

438
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:48,969
every switch everyplace in the

439
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:51,359
United States when you have a telephone
there you have something called the

440
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,289
central office

441
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:56,699
arm every wire in your exchange
basically every phone usually terminates

442
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:57,559
in this office

443
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,219
sort of I this way is a multi putting it
in there some type I'll

444
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:05,289
fight their fiber optic sings if you're
really on the boondocks arm your switch

445
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:08,209
is located here's a little building it
has your phone company logo on it

446
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,499
usually downtown

447
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:12,949
if you're in a small town or its just
popped up somewhere your neighborhood

448
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:16,559
on it's very hard to get in Thank You
911

449
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,949
are the best ways just asked some way
you can just going to say

450
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:23,239
hey I'm thinking about becoming a few
phone company person can I see what you

451
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,989
guys do and they'll say oh sure

452
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:29,469
arm one of my friends actually did this
and he got the seals which unfortunately

453
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:30,239
he got

454
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:34,219
a large complaint about the Union so you
know everyone has to pay their pound of

455
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:34,589
flesh

456
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:39,149
arm they're usually not mean like they
once were back in the day the scheme and

457
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:41,309
24/7 because electronics thing

458
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:44,749
I'll sorry let left a mechanical things
break arm

459
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:49,369
the right now the usual man probably
maybe 925 Prost we slightly longer

460
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:53,139
I actually saw one of my switches
everyone I was sitting up front in

461
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:56,999
thus with the shift ended and everyone
just one out so

462
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:59,839
it was probably completely min at that
point judging from the cars in parking

463
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:05,039
lot arm Comp Sparty lines and bridges
there's conference calls

464
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,009
and that's basically where everyone
joins up you're all talking to each

465
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:08,469
other

466
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:11,589
you probably have for those who might
have worked my perspective on these

467
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:15,249
freaks have all the time of a regular
folks in a couple of

468
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:18,889
free services to do it you have to
sometimes listen to an ad arm there's

469
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:23,029
pardon me there's mister conference
there someplace something called talkie

470
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,949
party lines

471
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:28,459
and there's also a couple other free
services just ask around here looking

472
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:28,709
your

473
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,579
actually seen a couple min Yellowpages
arm there's actually a couple from their

474
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:35,399
freak friendly one of which is currently
not working people's mind because

475
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:35,899
there's

476
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:39,339
for other dispute with his what company
you think he was banned for life

477

arm however there's a wonderful

478
00:28:42,349 --> 00:28:45,259
a project called tell a freak which is
still a freak dorgan they have their own

479
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,239
voice bridge

480
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:49,950
and there's usually a lot of people on
there in the

481
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,950
wee hours of the morning arm you can
also make your own if you have asterisk

of your own home

488
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:15,099

prime stations called recording your own

489
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:16,109
line

490
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:19,269
now according your line sounds kinda
stupid the you

491
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:23,499
probably thinking eyes wander
crystalline ok a solo illegal activities

492
00:29:23,499 --> 00:29:26,849
but we don't do that you're doing arm

493
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,178
while I perform I line-item e-commerce I
like to make recordings for preservation

494
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,999
because you never really know when
things are going to change i got really

495
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:34,149
pissed off one day

496
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:38,109
when I heard on the morning news that
Verizon change there for 11 system in

497
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,678
all the recordings that I used to know
for in there were there for like

498
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,809
ten years or so workable you prefer
waded into this wonderful

499
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:47,849
arm interactive voice response thing
done by

500
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:51,408
on tell me thank you arm

501
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:55,759
in its I system but I complete miss the
old one because it had paid

502
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,889
Patna path lead on their which was a
wanna the

503
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:01,999
people usually here when you're you know
your call did not go through please try

504
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:02,859
again

505
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:06,279
arm you never really know in this is
going to happen it's always fun

506
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:09,499
in you know just talk to people are
gonna record them when the piano icon

507
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:12,679
for something or recurrence after salio
up to you

508
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,700
arm I would Rebecca remember recommend
breaking

509
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,759
every record you me record every call
you make because

510
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:21,959
you know wants to do that arm
wiretapping laws

511
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:26,289
you are wiretapping believe it or not of
federal laws only require one person to

512
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:29,059
know how over your state laws say like
Massachusetts

513
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:32,859
required both parties to know on the
conversation so if you're

514
00:30:32,859 --> 00:30:36,449
recording I think if earlier for Corning
over state lines in you know you might

515
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:39,729
come under federal jurisdiction but who
really knows at this point

516
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:42,839
arm there's a couple ways are picking up
are recording airline

517
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,109
this on the call in induction pickup
coil which is weird by Radio Shack

518
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:49,549
arm they say put her on the back to the
phone handset in your court everything

519
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:52,289
you really can't do that you're going to
sound like crap what you need to do she

520
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,399
need to cram it up to the

521
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:57,159
receiver which is the part we put your
arm

522
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,190
a is really good force dynamics and
sound quality

523
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,149
on however it really knowing holding
that there for an extended period of

524
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:03,899
time

525
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:07,179
and you can't use near your computer
monitor because it picks up every little

526
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:07,499
bit

527
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:11,719
our snow is on the something called in
line %line. recorder which goes between

528
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:15,219
it also film it's very easy to use

529
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:18,999
arm is has little worst dynamics arm

530
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,119
in it's not as good as a hover quarter

531
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,279
sorry saga is a induction pickup coil
and finally there's something called

532
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,719
inline recorder which

533
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,989
in in telephone recorder which go to
swing your phone in the wall

534
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:34,329
on this very easy to use however it
sucks

535
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:37,918
yeah yeah they will

536
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,229
it do you still have the suction cup and
you can pop it on the back however the

537
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:42,679
problem is that the

538
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:46,440
it's such a need to clean up against a
receiver it to the the apps such a cup

539
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,059
is there and that's how the toll use it
but

540
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:52,129
disregard use your own way arm

541
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:55,209
there's something called silly codes
which it stands for common language

542
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:56,299
identify your

543
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:00,459
and Om identifies almost every piece of
equipment on telephone network

544
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:04,579
there's arm switches some conscripts
some customer premise equipment cell

545
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,249
phone towers routers

546
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:10,079
arm if you actually do it restructured
rice and sometimes you'll see one essay

547
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,469
our router name or something arm
everything

548
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:16,619
they're very cryptic like for example
there's one

549
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:19,829
my my next door town back when I was

550
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:23,309
living in Boston I'll was called Lynn
Massachusetts

551
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:28,099
in the east think it's called lyin n M
Aceh DS one

552
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:31,309
now if you look at that looks like a
bunch of that soup over does follow very

553
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:32,178
thing

554
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:35,209
lyin n Lynn me. Massachusetts

555
00:32:35,209 --> 00:32:39,529
ch is actually a building identifiers
which in this case is City Hall Square

556
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:43,599
arm in DS one actually does not stand
for justice which wants 10 traditional

557
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,639
switch to because they began counting at
zero

558
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:50,509
like same people arm he also no one in
boston called PSTN

559
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:53,509
are nabe ds0 which boss PSTN

560
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,039
Boston MA Massachusetts be. Belvidere
Street

561
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,429
ds0 digital switch 1 on this also a
couple other quick codes ears like you

562
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:01,799
know

563
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,950
a number MD which is usually a cell
phone switch on

564
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:08,629
Rs number which stands for remote switch
which is sorta like a mini switch

565
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:12,729
there has to be arm connected to a
full-fledged switching or network

566
00:33:12,729 --> 00:33:16,529
arm CG which stands for which is usually
much makin course

567
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:19,539
like a 180 or 181 r1a ESAs

568
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:23,200
on it would be like in OC g0 arm mg

569
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,739
which is crossbar which was an old
mechanical system which is no longer in

570
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:27,179
use

571
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:31,399
acceptance some foreign countries arm
can also sometimes you'll see

572
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:34,960
you know number number TV which stands
for tandem like for example

573
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,299
lwr and MEC exposed three key which is

574
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:41,569
Lawrence mass Canal Street arm 10 a
number three

575
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:45,450
which is a long distance local law local
told him in lawrence massachusetts

576
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,299
on however there's always comes kinda
strange things like

577
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:52,529
yes the enemy each 936 which is the
local

578
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:56,269
whether number in Boston arm and then
there's like

579
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,969
also another fun thing is they didn't
actually planned have this many

580
00:33:58,969 --> 00:33:59,779
telephoned his

581
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:03,969
tailpiece afoot in a telephone network
so Boston is also PSTN

582
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:07,419
in PST 0 because the increased and buy
one

583
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:10,500
so for example Nextel has a switch BS
goma

584
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,679
are 16 MD so

585
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,559
just keep that in mind if you're looking
for local telephone switch

586
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:22,549
so VoIP VoIP is the next big thing
coming off its actually turned here

587
00:34:22,549 --> 00:34:25,940
arm everyone sorrel lusting over this if
your telephone company

588
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,500
are theirs voice over Internet Protocol
multimedia over Internet Protocol TV

589
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,129
over Internet Protocol

590
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:35,389
in a protocols over nanoparticle arm
VoIP

591
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,960
no matter what anyone says like Vonage
on is not be telephone

592
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,399
who I'm sure seems that way but it
really isn't

593
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,940
are much less reliable has a higher mean
time between failures and it's just

594
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,960
different like for example 911

595
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,770
it was a big thing good enough that the
FCC had legislated that sleep app

596
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,239
support 911 because

597
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,910
P word I'll I'm on one getting a error
message so

598
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,109
ya thats how to be a bit inconvenient
wouldn't it

599
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:04,380
arm the one thing about 40 percent
there's little overhead therefore there

600
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,009
is little cost like for example

601
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:09,380
unlimited telephone long distance for
twenty-five dollars a month are however

602
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,279
telephone companies are catching on to
this

603
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:15,219
and since the been able to afford this
for years they just haven't told you

604
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:18,180

a month

606
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,170
arm VoIP is basically essentially the
same way arm

607
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,219
a telephone call goes thru acceptor
connecting to internet server

608
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:32,779
in the internet server probably cuz are
drops into the telephone network at some

609
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:33,849
point so

610
00:35:33,849 --> 00:35:37,180
say higher calling glad soon again I
would call them up they were connected

611
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,200
to the internet server

612
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,660
arm depending how big my telephone apply
for company was they may

613
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,129
pop it out somewhere in in maybe Arizona
were telephones are cheap

614
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,579
and they would only have to pay for the
call between Arizona and

615
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:54,059
Los Angeles so as opposed to having p
for the whole way
