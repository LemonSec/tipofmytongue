1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,090
everyone

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,900
man who needs no introduction it seems

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:18,900
these will fix it regional enormous

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,220
why turning those lights on its too hot
in here already

5
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,600
be sought to turn them down okay

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,440
you don't have to shine lights in my
face to make me talk

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,809
sat down

8
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:46,900
down down down down down

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,710
now a little more light in the audience
would be good so that I don't fall

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,420
asleep

11
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,080
you your

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,260
it's okay if you sleep no and you will
make a bunch of people unhappy if you do

13
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,140
but I shouldn't sleep here anyway

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,530
hmm we apologize for this delay due to
late arrivals equipment

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,950
and do we expect to get you moving
shortly in wish you a pleasant listen on

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,740
the way to the end to the speech or
wherever your final destination maybe

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,100
so I'm gonna talk about free software

18
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,370
and the hacker community first of all
I'd better explain what free software

19
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,820
mean since probably even a lot of view

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,610
have not heard what it means free
software mean software that respects the

21
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,860
users freedom

22
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,039
there are four a sensual freedoms

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,490
for the user software freedoms and every
software user should always half

24
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,750
and these four freedoms make the
definition

25
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,350
a free software freedom 0

26
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,510
is the freedom to run the program as you
wish for any purpose

27
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:08,170
freedom 1 is the freedom to study the
source code and change it's another

28
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,910
program

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,190
does what you wish freedom to

30
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,500
is the freedom to help your neighbor
that's the freedom to make copies

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,299
industry reason to others

32
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:21,989
including publication and

33
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,579
freedom three is the freedom to have to
contribute to your community

34
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:31,470
and that's the freedom to distribute
your modified versions including

35
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,450
publication

36
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,709
when you wish none of these is an
obligation you're never required to do

37
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,470
any of these things but point is you're
free to do them if you wish

38
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,480
and that means the software respects
your freedom

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,760
and respects the social solidarity

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,630
have your community if you use a free a
program that doesn't give you freedom

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,790
number two

42
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,190
you're in danger a falling into a morrow

43
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,209
the lemma at any moment when your friend
says

44
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:07,530
could I have a copy of that program at
that moment

45
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,129
you will be forced to choose between two
evils

46
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,569
one evil is to give your friend a copy

47
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,640
and violate the license of the program
the other

48
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,750
evil is to deny your friend a copy and
comply with the license over program

49
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,300
now once you're in the dilemma you
should choose the lesser evil which is

50
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,970
to give your friend a copy

51
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,970
and violate a license on the program
this is the lesser evil

52
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,660
because it's directed

53
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,480
at somebody who is done wrong we can
suppose that your friend is a good

54
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,870
friend a helpful person and what
narrowly would deserve your cooperation

55
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:59,819
whereas the developer of a proprietary
program has deliberately attacked the

56
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,280
social solidarity

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,129
love your community now that's wrong so

58
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,920
if you can help doing wrong to somebody
better at Rubys

59
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,870
a wrongdoer that you do it too however
to be the lesser evil does not mean it's

60
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,320
good

61
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,950
it's never good to make an agreement to
not keep it

62
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,090
now it may be less be and

63
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,300
than keeping you agreement depending on
what you agreed to do

64
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,450
but it's never good and

65
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,400
on on authorized copy a non-free program

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,050
shares most of the ethical wills

67
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,140
of and water iced copy the only one it
doesn't share

68
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,560
is that a rewarding the perpetrator

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,900
so what you should really do once you
have

70
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,250
understood this dilemma is make sure
you're never in it

71
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,500
don't set foot on the PS that's going to
lead you someday

72
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,490
to that dilemma and there are two ways
to avoid

73
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,550
one is don't have any friends

74
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,729
that's the message suggested by the
proprietary software developers

75
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:17,539
and the other messages don't use
proprietary software

76
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:21,900
that's the message I perfer that way I
don't have to worry

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,490
about tomorrow the lemma if someone
asked for a copy of a program I've got

78
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,380
on my computer

79
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,390
because I won't accept free software
onto it

80
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,610
is someone who offers me an attractive
convenient program

81
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,240
on the condition that I promise not to
share it with you

82
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,190
I will say no because that's the right
thing to do

83
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,440
and I would rather forego the
convenience and

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,580
and fun love that program and put myself
in a situation where I'd be ashamed of

85
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:59,380
what I had done

86
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,539
thank you

87
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:08,500
use but just being free to share

88
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,130
does not mean that you're in control

89
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,779
on your own computer for that you need
freedom number one you need to be able

90
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,339
to study the program and change it

91
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,700
that's what mean Abel's you to decide
what your computer dies

92
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,890
if you use a program that doesn't give
you freedom number one the freedom to

93
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,380
study the source code and change it

94
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,050
then the developer controls what you can
do

95
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,779
and you are under the developers power

96
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:43,229
this is on just this is and unjust
system

97
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:49,810
of subjugation

98
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,899
hmm if you don't have freedom number one

99
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:57,409
you can even tell for certain what the
program does

100
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:01,469
lots a proprietary programs have
malicious features

101
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:05,460
because once a developer is in a
position of power

102
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,159
the developer faces the temptation to go
one step further

103
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:15,950
and start using that power specifically
to mistreat others

104
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,409
so they put in spy features and

105
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:25,260
features designed to restrict the user
and even back doors

106
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,310
now spyware is quite common

107
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,729
one proprietary program that you might
have heard of that

108
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:38,729
spies on the user is called Windows XP

109
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:47,380
when the user have Windows XP and I
won't say you because I'm sure you would

110
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,919
use a program like this

111
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,700
when the user Windows XP searches her
own files for a word

112
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,070
it sends a message saying what word was
searched for

113
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,479
that's one spy feature but there's
another that we know of

114
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:06,789
when Windows XP asks for an upgrade

115
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:13,789
it sends Microsoft to list them all the
software installed on the machine

116
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,000
now the spy features were not announced
by Microsoft people had to

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,169
discover them few investigation

118
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,810
which was not always easy

119
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,789
and there may be others which we don't
know about

120
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:35,049
but spying is not limited to Windows
Windows Media Player also spies on the

121
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:35,478
user

122
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,130
reports everything the user looks at
total surveillance

123
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,330
but please don't think that this is
something that only Microsoft

124
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,640
the Great Satan would do because in fact

125
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,110
RealPlayer was the first such program to
do this kind of spying

126
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,209
total surveillance reporting everything
the user looks at

127
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:01,949
and all Microsoft did was imitate

128
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:08,949
thank you

129
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:20,529
by the way I hope you all know about the
worldwide boycott of coca-cola company

130
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:25,290
for things like murdering union
organizers in Columbia

131
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:32,290
see the site killer cloaked died or

132
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,030
hmm Sol

133
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,209
hmm

134
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,280
lots of companies spy on the user and
interestingly the TiVo spies on the user

135
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,199
in the same way

136
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,100
Rico reporting everything the user looks
at now

137
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,250
this is particularly interesting because
the TiVo uses a lot of free software

138
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,480
it has a small canoe plus Linux
operating system in it

139
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,670
and when it was first released a lot of
people in our community

140
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:20,010
applauded it for using free software but
it also contains non free software

141
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,580
and it has malicious features like
spying on the user

142
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,580
and digital restrictions management and
this shows

143
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,330
that Chi use

144
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,350
free software which implicitly means to
use some free software some other time

145
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,820
is not a sufficient target the target
has to be

146
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,670
to use only software that respects your
freedom

147
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,209
so that you have full freedom anything
less is insufficient

148
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,800
and the TVA was also an example

149
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,530
another malicious practice and I'll talk
about later

150
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:03,060
but malicious features go beyond

151
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,770
spying on the user there's also the
functionality is refusing to function

152
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,800
I'm

153
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,870
we're the program says I don't wanna
show you this file

154
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,400
I don't wanna let you copy party this
file

155
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,490
I'm not gonna print this file for you

156
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,780
because I don't like you enough this

157
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,250
is DRM digital restrictions management

158
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,640
or digital handcuffs where the program
is designed

159
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,819
specifically to restrict you for the
sake of someone else

160
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,040
it becomes a simple instrument

161
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,430
someone else's power over you and then

162
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:55,080
there a back doors there was a
proprietary program called InterBase

163
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,430
which was liberated

164
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,090
and then the user's could see that it
contained a back door

165
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:06,670
and they could fix presumably it had the
same back door when it was proprietary

166
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,229
but

167
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,900
the user's couldn't see it or fix it
another our proprietary program that

168
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,450
has a back door that you may have heard
of is Qualls Windows XP

169
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,650
you see when Windows XP asks for an
upgrade Microsoft

170
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,140
can identify the user which means

171
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,090
that they can deliver that user and
upgrade designed specifically for him

172
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,870
they can take total control of that
person's machine in any way they want

173
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,260
and that user has very little recourse

174
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:46,260
so we know about this back door cuz we
can deduce it from known facts

175
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,770
but there might be others Microsoft

176
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:00,199
was quite in 1999 having put a back door
in a piece a server software

177
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,730
for the NSA and there might be back
doors introduced

178
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,360
by others at Microsoft doesn't know
about for instance some programmers in

179
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,350
India working on the development of
Windows XP

180
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,420
were arrested and accused of working for
al Qaeda

181
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,360
trying to introduce another back door
that Microsoft wasn't supposed to know

182
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:21,820
about

183
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,990
well apparently that attempt failed

184
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,460
was there another attempt at succeeded

185
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,830
we can't tell now

186
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,920
their various kinds of malicious
features

187
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,180
thats proprietary software developers
can put in

188
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,680
but not all of them do so

189
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,880
some do and some don't course

190
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,930
you can't necessarily tell which is
which

191
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,030
sold the result is that all proprietary
software

192
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,329
is just trust me software

193
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,710
where you surrender to a blind faith

194
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,270
in a developer which you know might not
deserve it

195
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:09,780
but what are the ones that don't put in
malicious teachers

196
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,870
well there they may be honest but their

197
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:19,310
still human so they make mistakes and
that means that they're called has bugs

198
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,250
and the user Ave program without freedom
number one

199
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,770
the freedom to study and change the
source code is just as helpless

200
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,250
confronting and unintended error in the
code

201
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,960
as she is confronting a deliberate miss
feature

202
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:44,960
the user oven on free program is a
prisoner of his software

203
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,300
now we the developers a free software r
also human

204
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,750
so are called has errors to every
non-trivial program has bugs

205
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,620
the difference is that we respect your
freedom

206
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,760
so when you find errors in our called
you can fix them

207
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,560
we can't make ourselves perfect we can

208
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,560
treat you decently

209
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:26,150
but freedom one is not enough freedom
one is the freedom to personally study

210
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,810
in change the source code

211
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:33,030
to make it do what you want this is not
enough because millions of computer

212
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,220
users don't know how to program so they
can't directly exercise freedom 1

213
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,170
but even for programmers like me freedom
ones not enough because there's just too

214
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,520
much software

215
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,240
in fact there's just too much free
software nobody can possibly

216
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,500
study the source called all the programs
that she uses and master them wall and

217
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,550
personally make all the changes

218
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,750
that she might want the only way we can

219
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,340
fully take control of our software is to
do it

220
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,230
working together cooperating and for
this we need freedom three

221
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,010
which is the freedom to publisher
distribute

222
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,280
your modified versions with this freedom

223
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,140
when a few people make a change everyone
else can adopted if they like it

224
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,540
and as a result those millions and
non-programmers get the benefit

225
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,740
of what the programmers to

226
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,290
if there are a million users a free
program that wanna certain change

227
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,730
by chance we'd expect a few thousand to
know how to program

228
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,210
and someday a few of them will make that
change and release their modified

229
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,150
version and all the million

230
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,540
can get the benefit of so

231
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:58,300
freedoms 0 and to to run the program and
copy the program and distributed

232
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,240
those every user can do those don't
require knowing how to program

233
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,329
freedoms 1&3 involve programming so

234
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:12,359
you can only exercise them to the extent
you know how to program

235
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,750
book has people do that everyone else
gets the benefit as well

236
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,000
so these four freedoms are essential to
everyone

237
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,760
and the result of these four freedoms is
that the Software develops

238
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,839
democratically under the control

239
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,429
on the user's proprietary software

240
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:35,670
develops under the control of its
developer and gives that developer power

241
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,600
over the users

242
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,700
free software makes the users free

243
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,490
and enables them to control their own
lives

244
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:51,490
and that's what freedom means

245
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,050
Sol I reach these conclusions

246
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,050
in 1983 which is why I launch the free
software movement

247
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,470
and began developing the good new
operating system

248
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,470
good news not Unix for the specific
purpose

249
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,250
I love making it possible to use
computers in freedom

250
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,170
most to the user's and their maybe
around a hundred million of them

251
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,420
above the ghetto system don't know which
the new system

252
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,880
in 1992 when the new system was almost
finished

253
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,800
them main mission component was the
kernel and at that point

254
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,379
a colonel named Linux filled that gap

255
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,710
so the what people use including me

256
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,190
is actually the combination of the
ghetto system with Linux as the colonel

257
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,450
the you know plus Linux system but

258
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,530
most people are misinformed and think
that the whole system is Linux and don't

259
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,830
realize that we developed it

260
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:58,780
that's unfortunate because in addition
to forgetting the role

261
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,330
love the members have the good new
project hundreds and thousands of us

262
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,909
they forget in the development of the
system which i think is Linux

263
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,940
they also forget the role of the ideals
of freedom

264
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,220
and social solidarity

265
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:21,650
which were the motivations for doing
this work

266
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,790
other operating systems were developed
for technical motives or commercial

267
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,780
motives

268
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,389
this one was developed for the sake of
freedom and social solidarity

269
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:37,040
and when people forget that it's
dangerous

270
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,740
because if people don't value their
freedom

271
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:45,900
they will lose it history including the
recent history of our country

272
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,110
shows this clearly

273
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:55,900
and

274
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,220
when people you

275
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,900
when people don't value their freedom
they won't defend it

276
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,660
but in order to value the freedom they
have to know about it

277
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,880
and in the field the computing because
it's so new

278
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,480
we haven't had much time to teach people
we haven't had much time to discover

279
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,090
what the appropriate human rights are

280
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,120
well I think I've identified four of
them

281
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,450
the four fundamental freedoms that
define free software

282
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,110
are for human rights that every user of
computers

283
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,110
must have

284
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:42,060
hmm but how are we going to teach people
about this

285
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,190
when the system that we developed for
these reasons

286
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,950
is confused with Linux and everyone
knows that the developer apps Linux

287
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,660
doesn't believe in these freedoms that
he supports quote open source

288
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,790
unquote and that he develops

289
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,990
Linux just to have fun

290
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,460
well I've got nothing against having fun

291
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,900
I expected almost every free software
developer is having fun doing it

292
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:20,900
and they should have fun what could be
more fun than programming

293
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,429
but if thats

294
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:32,009
all we think about if we don't know how
to be serious as well

295
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:35,230
if we don't recognize serious goals

296
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,679
that are so important that they're worth
sacrificing some have your fun

297
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,039
goals like freedom

298
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,539
and democracy then what's going to
happen

299
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,029
well bush's already showed us what's
going to happen

300
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:59,029
hmm

301
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:08,690
we used to admire the people who
sacrificed their lives so we could have

302
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,359
freedom

303
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,070
and now we're invited to sacrifice our
freedom

304
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,210
to protect us from small unlikely
dangers to our lives

305
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:21,960
and i think thats stupid

306
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,230
and backwards and insults the people

307
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:32,230
who fought to get us freedom in the
first place

308
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,850
so how did I reach these ideas

309
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:47,570
what led me to conclude in 1983 that
software should be free

310
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:53,060
a proprietary software is on ethical and
antisocial

311
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,370
that it was a social problem and that we
had to solve this problem

312
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:04,370
by getting rid of it it all goes back to
the hacker community

313
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,490
in the 1970s

314
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,840
I participated in the hacker community

315
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,449
a community of programmers who were in
the habit normally have sharing their

316
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,020
work with everybody

317
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,300
anyone anyone who was interested because
that was our way of life

318
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,130
because we were programming for the joy

319
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,370
yes we were having fun

320
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,050
but having fun let us to a way of life

321
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,610
and a way of thinking about our way of
life having fun

322
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,510
put together with the political ideals

323
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:46,830
that worked what to us by the United
States of America

324
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,679
and then conspicuously disregarded

325
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,630
by the United States of America in the
war in Vietnam

326
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,400
hmm when I joined

327
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,960
this community we called ourselves
hackers

328
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,620
and what that meant was that we were
programming

329
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,410
with jointly with gusto with enthusiasm

330
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,500
and that that was what it was all about
we were using

331
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,020
our intelligence in a playful way

332
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,300
sometimes just for fun sometimes doing

333
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,700
useful jobs that that needed to be done

334
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,850
but either way we could still eat enjoy
our

335
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,570
using our intelligence in a playful way

336
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:43,570
and that's what hacker meant and that's
what it still means

337
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:52,168
when I joined this community

338
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,389
it was during the Vietnam War I had
nightmares

339
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:00,639
X well sort of like nightmares except
they were quite

340
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:06,100
they weren't asleep what you call them
horrible negative fantasies

341
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,669
of being drafted in being destroyed

342
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,259
because I refuse to call officers sir

343
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:20,259
I had learned to love freedom and what I
saw in front of me was the exact

344
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,740
was a perfect enemy a freedom

345
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:29,529
drafting people to fight to keep one
dictatorship in power instead of another

346
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:34,330
and doing so based on lies

347
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,970
we now know that the

348
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,990
Gulf of Tonkin incident which was the
excuse

349
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:45,929
for sending US troops to fight in
vietnam was a fabrication it was a pure

350
00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:52,929
law

351
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,060
of course just about all of us despised

352
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,310
the the US government's policies at the
time

353
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,909
this was not unusual

354
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,170
what was unusual was that we had

355
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:15,580
a kind a free society in the artificial
intelligence lab

356
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,409
everyone was welcome to common use the
computer

357
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,460
and the reason was the hackers were in
charge

358
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,950
and every other computer facility there
were administrators in charge

359
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,120
and they made sure to have control over
what Anybody could do

360
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,430
the hackers before I got there

361
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:41,280
made sure that that couldn't happen by
declining to implement

362
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,450
security in the computer system they
realize that by

363
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,190
implementing passwords they would simply
handedness traders

364
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,150
tools to control everyone we recognized

365
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:59,100
that a computer was security was like a
totalitarian police state

366
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,570
where everything not explicitly

367
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,810
the everything you couldn't justify

368
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:09,909
was forbidden by default everything's
forbidden

369
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,050
except a little space where you're
allowed to do things

370
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,730
and anything and take a look at our
policies

371
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,990
anything that might enable you to throw
off their control is forbidden

372
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,360
because maintaining themselves in
control

373
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:32,610
is always the first priority so once you
start following up this analogy you'll

374
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,630
see a lot of similarities

375
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,650
so

376
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:44,650
back in the seventies we didn't have to
fight to defend our practices sharing

377
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,190
software we just did

378
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,050
we always did people shared software
with us

379
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,950
we used it we wrote software and
sometimes other people want it we shared

380
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,260
it with them and they used it that was
simply our way of life

381
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,440
we appreciate it but we didn't have to
fight for it

382
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,980
we just went on living in what we had to
fight

383
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:13,490
was pressured to have security it was in
1976 or sell that

384
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,560
everyone else said the net is too big
you can't have a computer without

385
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:24,020
security now on we just kept on doing it
people would log in

386
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,129
they would they'd heard that there was a
command you could give to

387
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:33,450
said a set the system to shut down so
they would type the command in

388
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,860
it would work they would you would say
sh system shutdown schedule in 10

389
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,570
minutes

390
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,120
and then someone else for canceling well
the other users didn't want to go down

391
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,490
so they cancel it but the point is there
was no security stopping anybody in the

392
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,430
world from

393
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:56,110
logging in on our machine and doing this
but the users were there

394
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,890
and when they're the sketch the shutdown
wasn't supposed to happen

395
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:06,890
they cancel it if there was a shutdown
for a good reason like system

396
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,290
maintenance then

397
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:16,290
the user's understood and they didn't
cancel it and sometimes people said what

398
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,530
if somebody answer

399
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:26,220
inserts a bug into your code and I said
well they can't possibly insert as many

400
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,100
as I do

401
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:34,100
so I guess I'll just fix that bugs like
i fix the other ones

402
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:59,270
I

403
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:04,629
mmm so

404
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,060
one of the things that hackers
occasionally did

405
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,700
in their spirit of cleverness was

406
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,290
try to break security on other machines
which had security

407
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,690
but that's because the other in on the
other machines the hackers were in

408
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,520
charge

409
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,639
on our machine the hackers were in
charge so

410
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,760
we just didn't implement the security
and there was no need to ever break it

411
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,490
so

412
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:37,490
our machine is probably the only one
security was never broken

413
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,640
hmm and in nineteen eighty or so

414
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,380
some journalists found out about our
community

415
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,289
and they misunderstood the word hacker
they thought it meant

416
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:59,650
breaking security and we've been
struggling against that

417
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,640
confusion ever since telling people
that's

418
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,919
those who break security or crackers and
that to be a hacker means to

419
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,760
I im use yourself by using your
intelligence playfully

420
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,539
doing any kind of thing doesn't have to
be with computers

421
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:26,070
you know you can odd spring a surprise
party on your friend thats

422
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,139
could be a hack you can not write music
that's a hack

423
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,520
I I believe

424
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,320
I'm I believe multiple composers have
written

425
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,289
palindrome ik musical compositions the
1i know about

426
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:47,490
190 is by beyond national who lived in
the 13 hundreds

427
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,010
and wrote a piece whose name is
basically

428
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:56,379
my and is my beginning it's a three-part
peace

429
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,809
the top two parts are there are are each
other's mirror image in and the bass

430
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:01,970
part is its own

431
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:08,140
mirror image except for the accidentals

432
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:13,720
which help it sound good and since she
was a great composer

433
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,289
he made it sound good as well as being a
hack

434
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:24,289
I'm told that JS Bach did something
similar but I don't think I've ever

435
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,740
heard that peace

436
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,030
however those are not the only

437
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,139
composers that are hackers John Cage

438
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,710
I would say was a hacker hero day
celebrated piece which has no notes

439
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,929
and consists of silence now I would say
that that piece

440
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:50,929
has 0 musical value but it has some hack
value

441
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,520
hmm so the hacker community

442
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:08,520
and the way we cooperated taught me to
appreciate the Free Software way of life

443
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,980
so that when that community died

444
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:17,210
in the early 80s I was like the frog
that was

445
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,270
suddenly thrown into the hot water and
jumped out

446
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:26,139
other people just took it for granted
that when you use computers you were

447
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,650
under the power is the developers how
else could it be that he asked

448
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,650
how could you complain

449
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,780
what else could there be accepted Lords

450
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,490
bullying you I guess they must be like
God

451
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,210
most of the commoners in Europe in the

452
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,230
in the 10 century what could there be
except

453
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,410
Lords bullying you the idea that there
could be any other way of life

454
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,680
never occurred to them but I F

455
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,520
had the good fortune to experience a
different way of life

456
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,110
a way of life based on freedom and when
it was taken away from me

457
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:15,110
I decided to fight I've always been

458
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:22,500
particularly good at saying no

459
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,509
but when I launched the free software
movement

460
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,990
I didn't rely II launched it

461
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:38,859
in a context of more or less

462
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:43,850
democracy and more or less respect for
human rights

463
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:47,500
I didn't realize how much

464
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,989
those things could be destroyed globally

465
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:58,760
how vulnerable they were using computers
is just one

466
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,830
area of life it's not all of life

467
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,840
Ste shocking is that statement might
seem

468
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,150
coming from me I'm

469
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,210
and when

470
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,040
democracy is mated joke byee

471
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,340
computers in voting machines by

472
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:28,410
me I'd expensive requirements for people
to vote

473
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,220
by lying to people home by a
fraudulently denying them the right to

474
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:33,830
vote

475
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:38,900
by throwing away their ballots bile not
letting them get ballots

476
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,260
what are we going to do

477
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,320
when human rights are trampled

478
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,410
arrogantly by a government to then gives
promotions to the people who are

479
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,259
responsible as a way of speeding at
people who value freedom

480
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,100
what are we going to do I don't know

481
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,830
I can't see much hope for the United
States

482
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:10,670
I can imagine how the United States can
recover freedom and democracy

483
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:17,670
I certainly can see how the democratic
party would do it

484
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,820
but I'm use to wha carrying on despite
discouragement and that's what I do

485
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,830
I'm

486
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:44,250
there was always a certain tendency for
the US government to be too subservient

487
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,430
to business

488
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,580
but back in the sixties and seventies

489
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,920
it wasn't that strong very often %ah

490
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,370
laws were passed to restrict businesses
because lots of people wanted that

491
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:02,029
and nowadays no democracy has become so
weak

492
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:05,730
and the media industrial complex

493
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:10,620
so powerful that's you

494
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,950
the US government offers very little
resistance to what large companies want

495
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,040
in particular antitrust law

496
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,029
has been nearly abolished mergers

497
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,780
large companies happen all the time and

498
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,110
not only that we see

499
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,240
conspiracies large companies being
formed

500
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,900
to re to restrict and oppress the public

501
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,510
conspiracies such as

502
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,750
the one that controls the format of
DVD's

503
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,390
the one that implements

504
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:55,930
treacherous computing and then there is
the axe

505
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,509
ACS which is designed

506
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,630
to forbid analog outputs

507
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,330
for playing video hmm

508
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,860
these conspiracies ought to be
prosecuted

509
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,450
all the companies involved with them
want to be prosecuted

510
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,630
for restrict for conspiring to

511
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,630
restrict the public and its

512
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:28,630
such conspiracy should not be allowed to
exist anywhere in the world

513
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:44,069
hmm

514
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:53,029
and partners a reason is that they don't
allow people to hack

515
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:59,200
these conspiracies have the goal

516
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,390
of making it impossible for us

517
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,480
to understand and control the machines
that we use

518
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,650
because those machines are supposed to
control us

519
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:17,650
not we them so people who want to hack
on them that he is

520
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,830
figure out what they do change to make
them do each

521
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:29,830
other interesting things are supposed to
be forbidden

522
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,339
now this is not the worst thing about
those conspiracies but it's symptomatic

523
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,850
the people who are trying to restrict
the public

524
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:45,270
almost invariably turn to try

525
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:51,500
to restricting the public's ability to
understand and control their machinery

526
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,100
the TiVo

527
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:01,020
pioneered a technique for doing this
which I call teva wise ation

528
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,470
the TiVo contains

529
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:09,490
a small canoe slash Linux operating
system including several programs

530
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,290
released under the GNU General Public
License

531
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:18,020
that license requires them to distribute
the source code to the users and I

532
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,119
believe they do

533
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,800
and then the users have the right to
change it

534
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,040
and compile it and install their changed
versions in the TiVo

535
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,630
we're upon the TiVo doesn't run

536
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,300
the TiVo has a special mechanism
designed to detect

537
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,270
that the software has been changed and
shut down

538
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:44,640
it will only run versions that were
authorized by the maker

539
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,640
hmm

540
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:59,020
which means that freedom one nominally
exists

541
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,600
but practically speaking does not

542
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:09,190
it has become a sham and GPL version 3

543
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,200
we're going to forbid

544
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,550
tvoi zation we aren

545
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:20,500
mmm

546
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,240
we will not forbid DRM

547
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,270
people will still

548
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:32,869
have freedom number one the freedom to
modify the source where to do whatever

549
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:33,880
they want

550
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,040
and freedom three the freedom to publish
those modified versions

551
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,220
if the developers have a product like
the TiVo

552
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,000
want to implements spyware and Dr Ram

553
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,550
%ah sending back reports on what you
watch

554
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,220
stop not providing any way to copy the
recordings out as a machine

555
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,510
they can do so they will still have the
freedom to do so

556
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,310
as they should what they will not be
able to do

557
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,400
is released those in such a way

558
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,290
as to deny you the freedom to on do what
they did

559
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:11,509
cuz you also deserve freedom number one

560
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:17,080
you or they can change it to restrict
the user

561
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,920
they will be free to do that and you
will be free

562
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,380
to change it not to restrict the user
they will be free to change it to spy

563
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:33,380
and you'll be free to change it not to
spy

564
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,848
freedom 0 is the freedom to run the
program

565
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:47,480
as you wish for any purpose some people
get it wrong and I think it means the

566
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,210
freedom

567
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:54,450
to utilize the program for any kind of
social purpose including inflicting it

568
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,380
on others

569
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:01,280
that's not freedom that's power freedom
0 means just

570
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,640
literally your you're free to run the
program and use it to do whatever job

571
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,319
you like

572
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,190
but and so of course are manufacturers
like those who make the TiVo they're

573
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,940
free to run the programs and do whatever
they like

574
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,250
but they're not free to impose their
purposes on your use of the program

575
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:24,089
because that's where you are supposed to
have freedom

576
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:31,089
and their freedom has two and were yours
begins

577
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,450
hmm so I'd like to urge you

578
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:46,120
to look it's the website of our new
campaign against DRM

579
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,220
it's called defect is by design

580
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,430
dot or because

581
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,810
products with the RM are defective by
design

582
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:59,810
that's what Dr Ram is it's making the
things defective to restrict you

583
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:03,880
this is a grassroots

584
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,390
campaign various kinds of protests in
actions

585
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,230
go to the site sign up and participate
in the next action

586
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,620
and the one after that the one after
that the the more view there are

587
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,960
the more effect we will have in creating

588
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,560
a political debate about the ethical
legitimacy of these conspiracies to

589
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,810
restrict the public

590
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,279
am

591
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,900
are other web sites include

592
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,590
the new dot or and FSF Todor

593
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:42,860
you know .org for the new system and FSF
to work for the Free Software Foundation

594
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:48,310
you can join the Free Software
Foundation as a way of financially

595
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,590
supporting our work

596
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:55,280
it costs sixty dollars a year for a
student

597
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,310
and a 120 a year for a non-student you
can do it through the website

598
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,100
or if you don't wanna do e-commerce you
can get a card for me

599
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,440
which you can mail in am

600
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:15,440
outside we have copies of the book free
software free society available

601
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,710
is by is no balance here

602
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,650
have you seen him he's downstairs

603
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:29,240
which floor what I can hear you where Z

604
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,290
he's in the main mezzanine

605
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:38,020
on the second floor so that's where you
can call them

606
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,980
probably make you're probably some other
things available to so

607
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,130
now before I E ask for questions

608
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:52,130
I will present my other identity

609
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:57,990
I am Saint

610
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,520
IGNOU CS of the church's e-maxx

611
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:09,520
I bless your computer my child e-maxx

612
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:20,410
started out as a text editor which
became a way of life

613
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,879
for many users because they could do all
their work

614
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:30,250
without ever exiting from the max and
then it became a religion when somebody

615
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,470
started the newsgroup

616
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:36,330
of dot religion dodi max and today

617
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:41,779
in the church is the max we have a great
schism between two rival versions re/max

618
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:47,520
and we also have Saints but fortunately
no gods instead of God's we worship in

619
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,030
editor

620
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:54,710
to be a member of the church is the max
you must print outs the confession I've

621
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:55,290
the face

622
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,920
you must say there is no system but

623
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,250
the new and Linux is one of its colonels

624
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:08,030
hmm

625
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:11,680
the church is the max has certain
advantages compared with other churches

626
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,609
I won't name

627
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:16,300
for instance to be a saint in the church
is the max

628
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:23,300
does not require celibacy but it does
require living a life of Morrow purity

629
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:37,100
you must exercise any evolve proprietary
operating systems that have possessed

630
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,990
any of the computers under your control
and then

631
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,200
install a wholly free operating system

632
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,070
and only install free software on top of
that

633
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,530
if you make this valley you live by it

634
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:59,110
then you too will be a saint and you may
someday have a halo if you can find one

635
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,670
because they don't make them anymore

636
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:04,570
and

637
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,830
sometimes people ask me whether it is a
CNN the church if the max

638
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:15,830
to use the other editor VI well it's
true that VI VI VI is the editor of the

639
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:22,830
beast

640
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,880
but the you serve a free version A VI

641
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:34,610
is not a sin it's a penance and
sometimes people ask me

642
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:39,040
whether

643
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,970
my halo is really an old computer desk
this is no computer disk this is my halo

644
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:49,010
but it was a computer disk in a previous
existence

645
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:53,650
so now thank you and I will

646
00:49:53,650 --> 00:50:00,650
answer your questions

647
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,229
this

648
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:13,229
now

649
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,969
I am half deaf so when you speak to me

650
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:21,910
you need to speak loud and clear and
slowly

651
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,170
okay

652
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:28,890
but even with the microphone you still
have to speak loud and clear and slowly

653
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,569
because otherwise I one year you

654
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:35,859
so I guess people can just line up over
here to ask questions I

655
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:39,960
thanks for your great talk my question
for you is what is your opinion about

656
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,969
pride Terry services on the web why
don't know what that means proprietary

657
00:50:44,969 --> 00:50:48,079
service is the concept of proprietary
software

658
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,880
doesn't transplants to a service it
doesn't

659
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,900
I can see how you would adapt it for
what it would mean

660
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,930
so in this case I mean control love your
own data

661
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:02,589
when it's running a service that's not
good for all well that's obviously not

662
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:04,029
respecting your freedom

663
00:51:04,029 --> 00:51:07,499
but you know you first of all you can't
trust

664
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:12,170
important data to a corporation in the
US

665
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:19,170
this is why for instance

666
00:51:20,289 --> 00:51:24,150
I don't use my credit card to buy sinks

667
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:28,219
I don't want a database to know what I

668
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:31,319
water where I was I

669
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:37,079
but you know things like your email a
few years ago I read about somebody

670
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,739
vicki was a lawyer who defended people
that the US government doesn't like

671
00:51:41,739 --> 00:51:45,049
and so the US government he asked his
ISP

672
00:51:45,049 --> 00:51:49,400
to lose his account and it did so

673
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,930
and he was never able to get his

674
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,700
male or his mailing list his list his
address book

675
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,079
back from them I you can't trust

676
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:05,469
thank you very much

677
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:09,759
now %um

678
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:13,029
if you are also there are people who say
that

679
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:17,569
in a few years we won't use our
computers to do things in our computers

680
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:19,479
are perfectly capable doing like

681
00:52:19,479 --> 00:52:25,279
editing files and computations and so on
that will do all these things with web

682
00:52:25,279 --> 00:52:25,920
sites

683
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,359
well it seems woefully dumb ot I

684
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,598
and I'm not going to do it now

685
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:36,749
other people I can't stop them but I
think it's a really stupid thing to do

686
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:40,380
and every time someone talks about it we
should say so and

687
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,700
of course there's a practical reason
that then you won't be able to do

688
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,819
anything without a network connection

689
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:52,609
what good is that but more important
than this practical problem

690
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:56,920
you simply can't have control over what
a program does

691
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,779
unless you're running your copy if
you're running a copy that belongs to

692
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:05,049
someone else then of course he controls
and not you

693
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:08,349
and it has to be that way right if
everybody's running

694
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:12,089
Google's copy of a certain program well
we can't wall

695
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:15,160
have control of what Google's copy does
right

696
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:21,038
that would be ridiculous but on the
other hand if we don't have control of

697
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:22,400
the copy we're running

698
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,489
we don't have control of our computing
so the solution is

699
00:53:26,489 --> 00:53:29,640
have a copy on your own machine it'll be
your copy

700
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,549
and then you'll be the one who can be in
control assuming it's free software

701
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:35,849
first of all thanks for coming

702
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:40,829
um and I know it is going to kill me but
could you explain the key concepts have

703
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:41,630
copy left

704
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,969
of cop K any license

705
00:53:44,969 --> 00:53:49,089
that grants the Four Freedoms is a free
software license

706
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:52,849
so there are two big categories a free
software licenses

707
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:58,700
according to house a grant freedom three
the freedom to publish modified versions

708
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,950
some say you can distribute a modified
version and you can make it proprietary

709
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:08,710
and some say you can distribute a
modified version but it has to be under

710
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,890
this License

711
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:16,890
thats copyleft so copyleft is a
technique

712
00:54:17,239 --> 00:54:20,249
for making sure that all versions of the
program

713
00:54:20,249 --> 00:54:23,650
are free and therefore it's a way of
ensuring that

714
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:27,489
all users get the Four Freedoms without
copyleft

715
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:31,279
you can release the program is free
software but by the time it gets to the

716
00:54:31,279 --> 00:54:32,109
user's

717
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:35,239
middleman could have made it non-free

718
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:38,660
now a course that may or may not happen

719
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:43,589
people can insist on using only the free
version and they'll get the free version

720
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:47,380
on and then they'll have freedom but
many people may be seduced by the

721
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,509
temptation to improve non-free version

722
00:54:50,509 --> 00:54:54,789
consider for instance Apache Apache is
very popular

723
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:58,589
and its license is free but not copy
left

724
00:54:58,589 --> 00:55:01,828
and when you see the figures about the
fraction of

725
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:05,880
machines on the net servers on the net
that are using Apache well

726
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,739
vac counts the modified non-free version

727
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:17,140
and to the fractionator running a free
version patchy is considerably smaller

728
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:21,109
so it is a real problem today that
non-free

729
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:26,690
modified versions can result in users
not really having freedom

730
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:31,880
now my goal was specifically to give
users freedom so I developed the

731
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,390
technique

732
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:36,109
copyleft to make sure they really would
get the same freedom

733
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:39,640
that the program when it got to your
hands would come with the same freedom

734
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,729
that it had when it left mine

735
00:55:43,729 --> 00:55:48,009
okay I'm sorry for this before but I'll
I gotta ask what disturbs your own

736
00:55:48,009 --> 00:55:51,259
I run 0220 okay in which

737
00:55:51,259 --> 00:55:55,140
I i chose because it is entirely free
software

738
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,239
you know the extent to which our
community has

739
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:03,059
lost track of freedom can be measured by
looking at the fact that there are

740
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:04,930
hundreds of distributions

741
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:09,719
on the canoe plus Linux system and
nearly all of them contain on free

742
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:13,059
software or recommend non free software

743
00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:18,229
for years there was literally no place I
could tell people to look for a free

744
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:20,170
version I've been a plus laps

745
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:24,449
because all the distributions i knoooow
had non-free suffering them

746
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:28,739
now there are a handful distribution
center entirely free

747
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:33,089
you can see the list on canoe dot or and
one other question real quick

748
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:36,969
arm I get asked ones for coming out well

749
00:56:36,969 --> 00:56:40,690
who knows but it doesn't make that big a
difference because

750
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:44,390
their is a freak I don't we can use so

751
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:48,660
you know having I'd like to see the new
kernel getting to use

752
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,210
but it's not want to the high priorities

753
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:56,410
our community now it turns out that
there are some serious problems with the

754
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,460
design of mock

755
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,559
and to make heard really work and

756
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,109
she had to say be secure

757
00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:08,319
we need a new mic for crown now there
are projects were hoping to find one

758
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:09,670
from

759
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,670
at this point things are not are not
looking good for

760
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:17,619
for that but it's not that's not a
disaster

761
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:20,809
which kernel we use as long as it's free

762
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:24,049
is not a crucially important question

763
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,180
whether any given part is the system

764
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,640
is the program that was developed by the
new project

765
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,799
that's not crucial what's crucial is
that it be a system

766
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:39,869
that respects our freedom and that the
users understand this so that they will

767
00:57:39,869 --> 00:57:42,309
defend our freedom

768
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:45,430
thank you

769
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:48,699
hi I'm intrigued by how

770
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:52,660
a freedom-loving hacker like yourself
came to produce an impressive

771
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:56,190
legal document like the GPL what you
know legal

772
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:02,579
you laws and freedom are not directly in
contradiction of course laws can be used

773
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,150
to oppress people

774
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:07,930
and we see that more and more today but

775
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,489
the Bill of Rights is a legal document
to

776
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:18,489
just because it's not respected by the
US government doesn't take away

777
00:58:21,529 --> 00:58:25,049
doesn't take away its its

778
00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:29,299
virtue yes and so I was looking for a
way

779
00:58:29,299 --> 00:58:34,519
to guarantee freedom for every user and
the software that I wrote

780
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:38,319
and what could I used to do that there
was only one thing I could use and that

781
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,749
was copyright law

782
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:43,819
so that's what I used did you decide to
employ lawyer right off the bat

783
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:46,969
or did you get that a step on your own

784
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:50,299
I worked with the lawyer to write the
slice

785
00:58:50,299 --> 00:58:56,619
I don't remember precisely when I began
working with that lawyer and so on

786
00:58:56,619 --> 00:59:03,119
thank you and that something about what
happened in 1984 and 85

787
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,210
tonight you know my memory is precisely
when

788
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:11,719
what happened is is too vague now

789
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:15,359
hi on I'm curious how you

790
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:18,980
would address the propensity of software
licensed under

791
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,219
the GPL to grow very

792
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:26,640
monolithically and as one large
application because

793
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,429
developers based on the structuring of
the licensor freighter

794
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:35,589
break it out into small interactions I
don't think that's true

795
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:38,609
mean I don't know what you mean I

796
00:59:38,609 --> 00:59:42,078
so given the back love the the canoe

797
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,769
Compiler Collection and introduction for

798
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:50,690
introspective frameworks to oh yeah and
that one case

799
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:53,699
we do not want to do anything

800
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:58,269
that might risk what's a rising non-free

801
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:04,039
the add-ons to gcc because our goals are
not primarily technical

802
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:08,670
rumors and go love the new project is
not a technical goal its freedom

803
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:13,589
and so we don't make technical decisions
based solely on

804
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:16,779
technical goals it would be a mistake to
do so

805
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:21,400
would've reason I'm mention this at
least as I've identified

806
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,059
something for problem is going back to
it's not a problem

807
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:28,869
what ok itself going back to ease about
freedom 1

808
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:32,829
and freedom three and how these require
programming skills and programming

809
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:33,400
skills

810
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,029
given the tools we have an hour still
relatively difficult for people to

811
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:40,299
I don't know I don't believe you I think
you're mistaken

812
01:00:40,299 --> 01:00:44,880
I think programming is difficult because
it's inherently difficult

813
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,529
and it's true that some programming
platforms

814
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:52,819
require certain kinds of care like

815
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:57,058
don't walk off the edge over there
you'll fall down ten floors

816
01:00:57,059 --> 01:01:01,920
but except you don't die sell its that's
an exact it's like in a video game don't

817
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,249
walk over there you'll fall than 10
fours and lose this life

818
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:08,390
but the point is that yes it's true
solemn

819
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:12,299
are more like that and some of them are
more protective but the

820
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:16,559
difficulty is writing a program to do
something complicated

821
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,809
is the same regardless of the platform

822
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:23,329
okay then at like to know how you factor
that with

823
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:26,329
article or speech forget which I with
one on what

824
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:30,059
an article or speech read it on my so I
forget which it is that you mention

825
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:30,650
about

826
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:35,719
the benefit behind using e-maxx editor
in that if secretaries

827
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:39,650
II you know start using it it's just a
word processor and then they start yes

828
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,109
the US rose max

829
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:45,779
e-maxx it happens see you keep
presenting things as if they contradict

830
01:01:45,779 --> 01:01:47,449
each other and they don't

831
01:01:47,449 --> 01:01:51,609
which is a rather unfriendly thing to do
I

832
01:01:51,609 --> 01:01:55,549
e-maxx offers the possibility

833
01:01:55,549 --> 01:02:01,079
%uh writing fairly simple easy programs
which are nonetheless useful

834
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:06,759
and nice beginners can use this to take
their first steps in programming

835
01:02:06,759 --> 01:02:10,219
because these programs are useful and
easy to write

836
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:13,579
it's not that they're easy to write
because e-maxx

837
01:02:13,579 --> 01:02:17,759
makes the difficult easy rather these
things are just too easy

838
01:02:17,759 --> 01:02:22,299
but because in but in the context in the
next hour also useful to the person who

839
01:02:22,299 --> 01:02:23,479
might write them

840
01:02:23,479 --> 01:02:27,759
and so this could encourage your person
to take a few beginning steps

841
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:31,479
now this is not going to make hard
programs easy

842
01:02:31,479 --> 01:02:35,059
what it might enable a person to gain
some confidence

843
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:39,429
and that person may or may not go on to
learn harder kinds of programming

844
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:45,789
but whether or not the person does so I
think it's still a good thing

845
01:02:45,789 --> 01:02:52,400
thank you

846
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,920
what would you say to bill gates

847
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,380
in response to his initial comments
regarding the hundred dollar laptop

848
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:01,480
if you were standing right next to you I
never I don't pay attention to him so I

849
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,430
don't know what he said

850
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:08,779
bad things well

851
01:03:08,779 --> 01:03:14,009
I'm not surprised anything that doesn't
that isn't a tool for him to increase

852
01:03:14,009 --> 01:03:15,210
his power

853
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:20,329
over the rest to society he will say
some kinda bad thing about

854
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:24,890
you just have to start learn to ignore
these people

855
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:30,078
you know don't ignore the threat that
they make but don't pay too much

856
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,759
attention to what they say

857
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:35,039
do you think freedom is the highest

858
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,720
good I can't say that there is

859
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:44,089
a highest good freedom is tremendously
important because it's

860
01:03:44,089 --> 01:03:48,788
an essential part of having a good life

861
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:52,180
okay it

862
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:56,559
do you do you think that freedom should
be framed

863
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,759
in a positive or negative way I don't
understand

864
01:04:00,759 --> 01:04:04,499
me I my idea if I think a freedom is
something positive

865
01:04:04,499 --> 01:04:08,890
something good no I'm not sure what the
question means

866
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:12,430
well a negative conception freedom is
sort of like the bill of rights here

867
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:12,779
this

868
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:16,700
here is the domain I wouldn't call that
negative I think that's wrong to call

869
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,680
that negative

870
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,519
but freedom it's a mistake

871
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:27,339
to take all the important possible
problems that life can have and

872
01:04:27,339 --> 01:04:30,680
and squeeze them into the framework of
freedom

873
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,640
for instance starvation is very be add

874
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,430
but it's not an issue of freedom not
directly it's an issue having enough

875
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:39,980
food

876
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:45,599
now I'm this is a crucial difference
here which is that

877
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,619
people could not

878
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:55,009
could have not enough food for no
particular person's fault

879
01:04:55,009 --> 01:04:59,369
but anytime somebody doesn't have
freedom it's because somebody has

880
01:04:59,369 --> 01:05:01,999
subjugated him so there's gotta be
somebody

881
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:08,349
was done wrong now we could say it's our
moral duty to help provide food to the

882
01:05:08,349 --> 01:05:10,589
people who are hungry why would agree
with that

883
01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:16,819
I think we should but although we may be
able to solve their problem the problem

884
01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:18,319
is not necessarily

885
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:21,839
anybody's fault directly when a problem

886
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:25,730
where someone doesn't have freedom is
always somebody took it away

887
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:30,430
and this means that although we may not

888
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:33,859
always be able to provide everyone with
enough food

889
01:05:33,859 --> 01:05:38,220
we certainly will always can respect
other people's freedom there's nothing

890
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,499
ever to stop us

891
01:05:39,499 --> 01:05:42,619
this means that we can say

892
01:05:42,619 --> 01:05:45,759
we can't say we shall we

893
01:05:45,759 --> 01:05:51,109
must always give everyone enough food
Chris sometimes it might be impossible

894
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:55,970
but we can we can say we shall always
respect others freedom because it is

895
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:57,220
always possible

896
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:01,180
so if two people are in a room

897
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:04,539
and there is one bond nation divided
equally

898
01:06:04,539 --> 01:06:08,089
or that's an artificial unrealistic
situation

899
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,690
the what I've learned is that these

900
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,989
artificial morrow the lemmas often

901
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:19,640
are on a related to real life because

902
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,220
in real life things are always more
complicated than that

903
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:27,589
I don't know what I would say about that
situation

904
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:31,359
and I probably try to find out more
details hoping that someone those

905
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,269
details

906
01:06:32,269 --> 01:06:35,670
Mike suggest the resolution

907
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:39,410
you know the other thing is that when
you describe these artificial moral

908
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,160
dilemmas

909
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,999
you there so abstract

910
01:06:43,999 --> 01:06:48,220
that they don't give us much to go on
whereas

911
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:53,099
in real life there would be lots and
lots of details that might suggest some

912
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:56,410
way to resolve the situation

913
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:59,569
I'm

914
01:06:59,569 --> 01:07:03,980
I don't know therefore I mean I'll just
say I'm stumped by that artificial moral

915
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,079
dilemma but I'm not sure it relates much
to reality

916
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:12,960
I think what they example tries to
illustrate and I apologize to the

917
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,420
inadequacy my example is when

918
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:20,180
to freedom said people have but they're
not freedoms their

919
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:23,799
important interests but they're not
freedoms

920
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:27,329
okay so what is a freedom

921
01:07:27,329 --> 01:07:32,119
freedom means not being subjugated by
others

922
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:36,759
okay other the other ethical issues no
matter how important they are

923
01:07:36,759 --> 01:07:42,230
are the different kind when I say that
the issue of starvation

924
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:46,130
is not directly initial freedom that's
not to minimize it

925
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,609
is just to say it's different it's a
different kind of the issue

926
01:07:49,609 --> 01:07:52,819
and trying to squeeze East two different
kinds of issues

927
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,869
into a single framework is distorting

928
01:07:55,869 --> 01:07:59,890
okay so if I want the freedom to eat
that he said

929
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:03,190
bread but someone happens to own it

930
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:07,009
Audrey I think that's distorting the
situation okay that's fine

931
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:11,869
I'm just asking

932
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:14,999
hmm hi Richard what what becomes a

933
01:08:14,999 --> 01:08:18,949
independent media when more and more
they are forced to become their own

934
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:20,290
brand

935
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:24,149
their own brand I don't understand

936
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:27,388
whether it's the Italian government
shutting them down or the US government

937
01:08:27,389 --> 01:08:30,400
501 c3 charter asking them to make a
choice

938
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,909
whether they're gonna be not for profit
or non-profit or for-profit

939
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:37,250
I I don't know I mean I don't I don't
know enough about these

940
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:40,279
you're talking about specific issues and
I don't know about him

941
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:43,109
I don't have your little knowledge close
to the open source and free an

942
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:46,529
autonomous I don't to open source press
room at

943
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:49,969
me I'm not in favor of censorship and
i'd

944
01:08:49,969 --> 01:08:54,290
and I don't just mean I'm not just
against official censorship labeled as

945
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,210
such

946
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:59,000
I'm again systems that achieve

947
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,569
ninety percent of the effective
censorship without formally shutting

948
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:08,710
without formally silencing people such
as we have in the US

949
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:12,359
ob but I don't know what more to say
about

950
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:19,359
cases I never heard of

951
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:23,420
are getting back to the fun side of
things her the

952
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,620
explosion in the capabilities I love

953
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:30,599
technology the speed of processors and
things like now have allowed people to

954
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,800
approach problems that never before they
thought they could actually do

955
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,770
you know like me crazy games on their
cellphones things I'm wondering what you

956
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:38,110
think

957
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:42,639
are interesting problems that are before
us now to you think for the most

958
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,280
interesting but you know I don't know

959
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:48,149
tation only I don't know I don't have
time to think about questions like that

960
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:51,309
and I don't oh that was my other
question which is are you working now

961
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,160
full-time just

962
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,480
on working on this tougher licensing and
on freedom and I've you ever to vote in

963
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:55,960
the morn

964
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,970
I have whatever you like a crime for
programming I do a little bit of a work

965
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:00,890
on he max

966
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:06,830
and thats it because there is a job that
has to be done and that is

967
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:12,380
activism and we need thousands of people
to do it and first of all I'd better do

968
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,470
it thank you

969
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:20,470
from the thing that I find

970
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,840
little confusing about the issue of free
software is

971
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,870
exactly this is the reward the developer

972
01:10:28,870 --> 01:10:31,890
decides a-sixes silly question are just
as

973
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:35,670
please let me finish the question how
does it do

974
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:40,720
you were the developer decides the some
with abstract idea of having fun

975
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:45,300
while developing for I don't know let's
ask each developer why he

976
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,360
there are over a million free software
contributors

977
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:53,200
we could ask each one what rewards he
personally gets

978
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,910
that is the motivation why he
contributes

979
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,300
but I don't think it's terribly
important question

980
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,710
the if the fact is that lots of people
were contributing to free software

981
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:08,970
and they they have many different
motives it's a mistake to look for one

982
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,150
simple answer

983
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:15,570
to everybody's motives but for developer
that works in a capitalistic society

984
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,590
doesn't really

985
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:19,730
develop this is a piece of this is
totally silly we're all in a

986
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:21,220
capitalistic society

987
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:25,200
doesn't really gates development of of
software to a part time job

988
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,599
if you sometimes yes and sometimes no
again do you think

989
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:35,510
it are you trying to impose the false
supposition that there's a problem

990
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:40,080
that's what this argument's is amounts
to me you're trying to

991
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:44,809
conjure a problem out of thin air we
don't have a problem

992
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:48,360
what you're trying to challenge me to
explain the problem

993
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:53,320
well you're trying to challenge me to
solve the problem which doesn't exist

994
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,030
let let me give an example suppose
suppose a

995
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:01,719
I decided that I need so to work four
hours a day for a company to support my

996
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,250
bills

997
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,500
I knew okay and I have a

998
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,570
with over eight hours left to do a free
software well that's nice

999
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,849
thank you alright

1000
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:16,460
so then thats man

1001
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,800
for them free so for is just the

1002
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,650
is just going to be on a level a hobby
for everybody well I don't know

1003
01:12:23,650 --> 01:12:26,989
I mean maybe it is does that matter mean
it is

1004
01:12:26,989 --> 01:12:30,920
if my dream that's what we're doing a
great job I don't see why that should be

1005
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,519
treated as a problem

1006
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:36,210
well it's nice to be self-congratulatory
what know the less those

1007
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:39,980
some self through might require
full-time commitment from person and

1008
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:40,679
house-made

1009
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:43,969
cell I don't know I don't care

1010
01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:48,199
see the point is this is all secondary
for

1011
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:52,880
free software makes the world a better
place and proprietary software makes the

1012
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,110
world a worse place

1013
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:57,650
so obviously we should have no
proprietary software

1014
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:01,820
and then we should try to make as much
free software is people find useful

1015
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:06,860
soul thank you if you have a proposal
for how to help us make more free

1016
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:07,589
software

1017
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:11,840
that could be a good a useful thing
however clearly what we should what we

1018
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,719
want is zero proprietary software
because

1019
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,719
every proprietary program isn't

1020
01:13:17,719 --> 01:13:21,630
is a predatory system so in other words
no compromises

1021
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:25,639
you know if complete the Free Software
or doesn't matter even if it is

1022
01:13:25,639 --> 01:13:30,079
slate I'd rather have no software and
proprietary software

1023
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:33,079
because a proprietary program

1024
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:37,018
divides people and keeps them helpless

1025
01:13:37,019 --> 01:13:40,289
and not only that if my neighbors

1026
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:45,179
are using a proprietary program well
usually that means that they are making

1027
01:13:45,179 --> 01:13:47,980
a promise not to share with me

1028
01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:52,249
and that is hurting me that's degrading
my community

1029
01:13:52,249 --> 01:13:56,429
so it's not just their business alone
it's affecting me too

1030
01:13:56,429 --> 01:14:00,159
I want this proprietary software to
disappear

1031
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:04,460
and I am working for that purpose I
don't know if we'll ever get there but

1032
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,039
that's what I see is the ideal goal

1033
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:12,130
no proprietary software and then of
course I hope you make as much free

1034
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,480
software as we can

1035
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,570
there are businesses that hire people to
write free software

1036
01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:22,920
in France a month ago %ah the
organization a French free software

1037
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,110
company says that they have 10,000
employees

1038
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:30,549
obviously they're not all programmers in
software companies only a

1039
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:34,260
minority of people for programmers but
that still sounds like a fair number

1040
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,340
programmers

1041
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:41,690
so apparently people are getting paid to
write free software

1042
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:45,159
but indeed not everybody a lot of us do
it

1043
01:14:45,159 --> 01:14:50,440
as sort of when are when our other work
permits

1044
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:54,210
i cant right free software as much as I
might like to

1045
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:59,179
I have to do my activism instead thanks
of

1046
01:14:59,179 --> 01:15:02,510
okay

1047
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:05,800
stepping just a little bit away from
software based on the terms of freedom

1048
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,670
how do you view issues like the Creative
Commons and how they handle

1049
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,760
generating freedoms in publication I'm
sad

1050
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:17,429
I'm very disappointed with Creative
Commons the basic idea is a free

1051
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:18,499
software movement

1052
01:15:18,499 --> 01:15:23,269
is that there are certain freedoms that
people are entitled to

1053
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:27,309
and then then I after I reach that
conclusion I thought

1054
01:15:27,309 --> 01:15:32,389
what can I do to enable people to have
those freedoms

1055
01:15:32,389 --> 01:15:36,699
well I could write free software that's
the method I thought of

1056
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:40,010
on Creative Commons

1057
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:44,909
doesn't do that Creative Commons doesn't
have any position

1058
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:50,570
about what freedoms people want a half
it is avoid it doesn't want to have such

1059
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,299
a position

1060
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,729
if you look at all the Creative Commons
licenses

1061
01:15:54,729 --> 01:15:58,519
and take the intersection of what they
wall on lap

1062
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:05,519
it see empty set so that in that case is
there

1063
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,690
you I guess said do you support
traditional copyright:

1064
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:13,739
approached other stuff like that no I
think is there is a certain minimum

1065
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:15,659
freedom that people should have

1066
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:18,888
for all kinds of works and that is

1067
01:16:18,889 --> 01:16:24,550
for well for works that's that are used
to do practical jobs I believe they

1068
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:28,039
should be free in the same sense that
software should be free

1069
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:32,329
to this includes reference works
educational works and software

1070
01:16:32,329 --> 01:16:35,599
and recipes and some other things

1071
01:16:35,599 --> 01:16:39,440
for other kinds of works I don't think
that they all have to be free

1072
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:42,840
but I think that their is one freedom
that everybody should have

1073
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,900
and that is the freedom to

1074
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:50,090
non-commercial e redistribute exact
copies of the work

1075
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:53,960
for any published work you should have
that right

1076
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:59,550
thank you

1077
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:03,420
I just wanna personally thank you
because I you so much free software in a

1078
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:04,349
try to contribute

1079
01:17:04,349 --> 01:17:07,499
myself free software thank you for

1080
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:10,780
in project three suffer foundation arm

1081
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,900
I just wanted to ask what your thoughts
were you know this

1082
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,260
there's been I think commercial
companies try to figure out ways to

1083
01:17:17,260 --> 01:17:19,449
attack open source and try to keep it

1084
01:17:19,449 --> 01:17:23,079
you know the cauldron source was
designed to be easy to attack right now

1085
01:17:23,079 --> 01:17:24,429
I don't support

1086
01:17:24,429 --> 01:17:27,479
the one thing that when asked about was
I just use for your comments for what

1087
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:29,739
your thoughts were about the skill case

1088
01:17:29,739 --> 01:17:34,679
I knew that if it's it's has been very
successful in in putting a deferment and

1089
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:38,249
no free software anything like what I
never just like that's all it was a big

1090
01:17:38,249 --> 01:17:39,840
threat

1091
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,170
and the reason is even if skull had one

1092
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:47,630
all they would have one was the ability
to polls certain features

1093
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:50,690
out as Linux which is one free program

1094
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:54,039
in the canal plus Linux system and so

1095
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:57,630
it would have been unfortunate for those
who want those features but it would not

1096
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,269
have been crippling

1097
01:17:59,269 --> 01:18:03,530
that's what was clear all and he is also
my thoughts those wanting

1098
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:07,130
and presumptuous a few things that
people have been doing to

1099
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:10,710
for years now business goes has been
around for a while to audit the code is

1100
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:11,479
there

1101
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:14,969
you know they need types of tools right
I don't know

1102
01:18:14,969 --> 01:18:19,130
I any case I've never been involved with
the development of Linux

1103
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:23,219
alright that that's right Desertec the
Linux kernel Linux is the current

1104
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:26,789
right to the point is if that's not my
department

1105
01:18:26,789 --> 01:18:31,670
other people have developed Linux and
work on it you'd have to ask them

1106
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:35,769
thank you

1107
01:18:35,769 --> 01:18:40,389
I for to be introducing a bit chicken or
the egg paradox here but

1108
01:18:40,389 --> 01:18:44,019
I was wondering what your thoughts were
on proprietary software

1109
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,599
as a catalyst for

1110
01:18:47,599 --> 01:18:51,219
free software development in the term
serv

1111
01:18:51,219 --> 01:18:55,030
competing with turn offerings in what
the well suffer

1112
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:59,639
you know it's true that was let the
existence of the social problems can

1113
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:03,210
motivate people to make efforts to try
to solve them but

1114
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:06,860
I don't think that makes them good

1115
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:12,039
yet you know diseases can motivate
people to do medical research

1116
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:19,039
I think it's better for diseases did
don't happen you know

1117
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,420
thank you

1118
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,989
hmm um I just

1119
01:19:26,989 --> 01:19:30,489
you've really explain a lot today and
done it very well

1120
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:34,630
and your work in everything that you
doing is just great um

1121
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:38,230
I guess I'm gonna be the only one to ask
a non computer related question but

1122
01:19:38,230 --> 01:19:41,550
I've been dying to ask you this question
I've seen you talking to get to it

1123
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:46,060
absolutely a how can I grow such a
rocking beard like yours

1124
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:52,199
I don't do it I don't fertilize it
already thank you test grounds

1125
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:55,540
so it's all natural then I

1126
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:58,530
yes

1127
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:05,530
thank you

1128
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:09,679
Center quick question my real computer

1129
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,119
littered me with my son with it makes me
crazy

1130
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:16,558
may not be a purple what do you when you
speak up freedom what about the fact

1131
01:20:16,559 --> 01:20:17,119
that my

1132
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:21,280
my mother his grandmother can use a cell
phone anymore can change the channel you

1133
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:21,550
know

1134
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:25,189
free DVD player because everything is
become so complex

1135
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:28,590
they've lost that ability to to enjoy
what what's being produced

1136
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:34,229
well I I have nothing specific to say
about those things

1137
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:40,099
I don't use those things either but hmm

1138
01:20:40,099 --> 01:20:44,389
but the statement and to some nice that
we're talking about physical objects and

1139
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:47,499
you know changing a physical object
isn't quite so easy

1140
01:20:47,499 --> 01:20:51,299
is changing the program you can change a
program by editing

1141
01:20:51,299 --> 01:20:55,559
you can change a physical object by
anything are you have to go to

1142
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:59,079
you have to cut things insider things
and so on but

1143
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:02,889
ot to the extent that software is
involved

1144
01:21:02,889 --> 01:21:06,769
if it's free software the users are in
control

1145
01:21:06,769 --> 01:21:12,260
so to that ik to the extent that its
software involved

1146
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:15,979
the users will be able to get what they
want because they're in charge

1147
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:20,239
but it's not only a matter of software
so

1148
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:25,079
you know part we I can say that free
software will solve this problem 100

1149
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:31,030
percent

1150
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:34,769
no Noam Chomsky said in service work on
propaganda

1151
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:38,730
that the religion %uh capitalist society
is anti-communism

1152
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,340
and that's one of the reasons we see a
lot of censorship media is there

1153
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:42,989
censoring anti-communist ideas

1154
01:21:42,989 --> 01:21:46,060
I'm wondering is this

1155
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:50,210
anti-communist religion still a problem
for free software and if so

1156
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:55,840
why when communism is dead well for
small free software has very little to

1157
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,110
do with communism

1158
01:21:57,110 --> 01:22:01,570
I Rep

1159
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:06,620
I every I let me talk let me answer free
software does not have much resemblance

1160
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:07,610
to communism

1161
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:12,440
after all communism as we saw it was a
kind of dictatorship

1162
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:16,410
we are central planning would tell
everybody what to do

1163
01:22:16,410 --> 01:22:21,960
and died this is not much like the free
software community where everybody's

1164
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:26,800
free and everybody just decides what to
do and does it you couldn't get to

1165
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,650
things that are more opposite however

1166
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:34,630
I like you see persistently see odd

1167
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:38,080
power-hungry bastards

1168
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,650
calling us communist now what would lead
them

1169
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:45,730
to say something is absurd is that hot

1170
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:49,100
the reason is that we're

1171
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:53,110
in the way of their plans to control
everyone they're setting up a system

1172
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:53,780
which

1173
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:57,239
resembles communism which is a
dictatorship

1174
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:01,260
they you know is someone who uses
Windows is

1175
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:06,590
under the power of Microsoft Microsoft
makes a decision at the top

1176
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:09,770
other people carry it out they impose on
other people

1177
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:13,969
and are these people have basically no
choice

1178
01:23:13,969 --> 01:23:18,710
are they they have to keep paying in
taking what they get

1179
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:21,980
thought thats a lot like I

1180
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:26,010
a stalinist system I

1181
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:30,690
I'm command economy so

1182
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:34,030
and they don't know we don't respect
private property at all

1183
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:37,769
on Microsoft and many other companies

1184
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:41,860
that make proprietary software say that
you can't own

1185
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:47,389
a copy love their software its they
believe in private property only as long

1186
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:49,000
as it all belongs to them

1187
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,390
that's how they respect private property

1188
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:55,860
whereas

1189
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:59,410
with free software your copy

1190
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:04,040
really belongs to you we respect private
property they got

1191
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:09,330
so I'm of course the fact that they are

1192
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:12,949
insults are the direct opposite is the
truth never stop them before

1193
01:24:12,949 --> 01:24:17,230
it's exactly what you expect to see when
you look at

1194
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:20,380
Bush and his cronies and

1195
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:25,190
the corporations that are bush's masters
and so on you see over and over that

1196
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:28,890
their very lives become more arrogant
every year

1197
01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:33,440
I I'm so

1198
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,570
the reason they do it is for is nothing
more than

1199
01:24:37,570 --> 01:24:41,620
they think it might it might hurt us

1200
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:44,870
they think that they might be able to
get away with it

1201
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:48,940
and it doesn't have to be true not for
them

1202
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:53,320
and their right they might get away with
that in their right it might hurt us

1203
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,809
because the media is so big head at
pointing out

1204
01:24:56,810 --> 01:25:00,890
when the things that they say are
totally the opposite to the truth

1205
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:03,929
they they might get away with it bush's

1206
01:25:03,929 --> 01:25:07,500
Bush has a policy of sticking with his
lies

1207
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,610
no matter how long and he does it
because

1208
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:17,030
here for a lot of people on I don't II
year or so ago I saw

1209
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:22,849
holes saying that almost half of
americans still believed that saddam

1210
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:23,600
hussein

1211
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,760
have had weapons of mass destruction and
was working with al Qaeda

1212
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,770
even know these had both been
conclusively disproved

1213
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:36,480
and the reason is that the US me you
don't cover these things enough to teach

1214
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:37,780
most Americans

1215
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:41,139
some some managed to find this out

1216
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:44,890
but bushes right in believing that he
will fool

1217
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:49,820
successfully for a lot of people if he
just sticks to the law I and never

1218
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:54,460
admits it was wrong

1219
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:58,660
yes hello I want to thank you very much
the speech he gave you today and want to

1220
01:25:58,660 --> 01:25:59,719
thank you for the works the

1221
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:03,790
attributed to the community at large now
that that that that %uh the way

1222
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:08,650
arm I've only started myself to exercise
freedom 1

1223
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:12,679
to begin to look at this a free software
that I use and to begin to change it

1224
01:26:12,679 --> 01:26:15,830
fix it and do as I please with you know
those regards

1225
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:19,130
when I was wondering is that most I've
my

1226
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:22,870
existence as a parents and I like this
said as a person who hacks

1227
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:27,160
is mostly in activism I I stand for
issues I speak strongly on them I was

1228
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,360
wondering

1229
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:32,540
acres you seem to be a fine example this
you most likely often considered the

1230
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,820
question of

1231
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:38,009
exercising freedom one verses activism
in general versus peeking out

1232
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:41,550
I was wondering how you came to the
balance of

1233
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:45,820
actually writing software versus
activism and how you would suggest you

1234
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:49,110
well any person such as myself to go
about doing this I was

1235
01:26:49,110 --> 01:26:53,429
involuntarily self promoted into
management is what happened

1236
01:26:53,429 --> 01:26:57,230
I say I this this

1237
01:26:57,230 --> 01:27:00,500
you know I E started the new project

1238
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,850
once at the beginning the new project
was me and one other person so mostly

1239
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,900
what I did was write code

1240
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:11,219
but then as their cocks be more and more
people to a larger extent to get to

1241
01:27:11,219 --> 01:27:15,030
prague project required some management
so I had to do it

1242
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:19,110
I started the Free Software Foundation
and the president of it that means I'm

1243
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:22,650
have responsibilities in managing it I

1244
01:27:22,650 --> 01:27:27,449
cell and then people started inviting me
to give the speeches

1245
01:27:27,449 --> 01:27:30,469
I'll which clearly are important

1246
01:27:30,469 --> 01:27:35,250
so in this takes time people started
sending me lotsa emails

1247
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:39,860
sometimes they say are what should I do
about this situation is obviously I

1248
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:41,389
should give them advice

1249
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:46,630
it just start taking more more time so I
found other people to do the programming

1250
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:50,090
ICC say is more happenstance situation
and you found to speaking more than

1251
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,380
anything else

1252
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:54,449
yeah although speaking is not most of my
time

1253
01:27:54,449 --> 01:27:58,120
yeah now speaking today is a couple
hours

1254
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:02,599
this is the first speech I given this
week so

1255
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,300
it saw hmm

1256
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:11,850
you know different some days I give two
speeches that may mean six hours

1257
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:16,290
spend speaking and only four or five
hours

1258
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:20,699
six hours spent reading my man answered
my mail its

1259
01:28:20,699 --> 01:28:24,310
it varies but the point is it's that's
not a matter some

1260
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:30,230
some decision I made in an arbitrary way
I'm just responding the circumstances

1261
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:33,510
I and the stat and but if you're good at
speaking

1262
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:37,830
do it it's a very important because if
we could give

1263
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:42,480
everybody free software today to do all
the jobs they want to do

1264
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,320
tomorrow they have freedom but they
might not still have it five years from

1265
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,330
now

1266
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:51,130
because people would you offer them
attractive proprietary software

1267
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:55,310
and if they haven't learned to value
their freedom they could lose it easily

1268
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:59,540
the fool and his freedom are soon parted
so

1269
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:05,440
we need above wall to teach if we want
to establish freedom in a lasting way

1270
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,520
what we need above all is to teach
people

1271
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:13,210
these ideas so to learn to value their
freedom

1272
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:16,949
I understanding is much is actively the
birds in the print page to you

1273
01:29:16,949 --> 01:29:21,810
your response about the hearing from you
and I thank you very much for your time

1274
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:26,830
I'm glad you agree this next in a min
will have the last question and then

1275
01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:29,590
we'll be movin on into pent up north

1276
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:36,590
so that we can prepare for the next hour
person

1277
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:40,150
this question is regarding your is about
censorship

1278
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:44,150
Aria I have a good if people actually
realized that

1279
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:48,510
they could do all the things that
average computer user does like mine

1280
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:51,730
run a spreadsheet program do their taxes

1281
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:55,330
sector email on the they realize that
they could do that on a

1282
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:58,910
computer that's running thats
ten-years-old

1283
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:02,630
I mean the in do anything that would
hurt the computer industry

1284
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:06,380
who cares by Intel I mean

1285
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:10,800
basically I don't adrift I'm not against

1286
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,219
the I'm not against the manufacture of
computers

1287
01:30:15,219 --> 01:30:19,410
right I use computers I want someone to
make them I hope that they will make

1288
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,090
real computers

1289
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:26,330
there is a plan now to stop making real
computers you see a computer is a

1290
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,160
universal machine

1291
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:32,429
a machine that we can program to do
whatever we want

1292
01:30:32,429 --> 01:30:36,650
to imitate any other possible machine so
we only need one

1293
01:30:36,650 --> 01:30:42,199
now this characteristic a being able to
be programmed to do any computation

1294
01:30:42,199 --> 01:30:45,889
is what they're trying to take away
that's what treacherous computing is all

1295
01:30:45,889 --> 01:30:46,500
about

1296
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:49,719
to arrange their jobs at are pro
computers in the future

1297
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:53,440
yes be programmed to do at least not by
us

1298
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,870
and thus they won't really be computers
now that I think

1299
01:30:56,870 --> 01:31:00,730
BB and I want computer industry to make
real computers but

1300
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:04,010
as long as they do I don't criticize
that I'm

1301
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:07,449
happy if they make computers and other
people buy them

1302
01:31:07,449 --> 01:31:13,090
bought I am NOT going to regarded as the
purpose of the existence to give that

1303
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:15,190
industry success

1304
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:19,510
or any other industry you know I'm not
against making cars or

1305
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:23,929
chairs or tables were left light bulbs
are microphones

1306
01:31:23,929 --> 01:31:28,500
but I'm not gonna say that it would be a
tragedy if people wanted less of them

1307
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,570
and what lessons

1308
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:35,320
them I don't see that maximizing the
volume of a certain industry is a social

1309
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,250
goal

1310
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,870
and any case that that conflicts with
the idea free enterprise which is

1311
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:41,000
basically saying

1312
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,889
all right you can make it they can buy
it we'll we'll see how much they want to

1313
01:31:44,889 --> 01:31:45,310
buy

1314
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:49,520
go ahead it's a do you think that that
this is like more than just like

1315
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,160
Microsoft making our money

1316
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:55,420
you think that there's a conscious plot
bad for you I can make the latest new

1317
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:56,980
version of Windows to

1318
01:31:56,980 --> 01:32:01,800
as a divergence away from by Rio
understanding on how operating system

1319
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,860
works the fine with this I i don't know
what is what you mean by real

1320
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:10,040
understanding great on a divergence away
from command based operating system so I

1321
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,370
can I don't know about that

1322
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:14,480
I mean after all graphical environments

1323
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:19,010
a lot of people like and a lot of people
don't like me in line so I'm not

1324
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:20,750
contribute any malice

1325
01:32:20,750 --> 01:32:24,010
to the desire to support graphical on

1326
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:27,449
interfaces on the other hand we know

1327
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:32,910
that microsoft says the next version of
Windows is going to require this this

1328
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:36,449
and this in a computer so you all better
make this this and this in your

1329
01:32:36,449 --> 01:32:37,510
computer's

1330
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:41,429
we know that microsoft does this just
imposes this

1331
01:32:41,429 --> 01:32:46,219
on computer makers so this is not
speculation

1332
01:32:46,219 --> 01:32:50,120
I you can I think it's public knowledge
what they

1333
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:55,139
insist computers do and the next version
of Windows is going to insist on some

1334
01:32:55,139 --> 01:32:57,230
kind of treacherous computing

1335
01:32:57,230 --> 01:33:01,480
so all we know all that that Microsoft
is

1336
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:08,340
imposing participation in a plot to
restrict us

1337
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:12,510
but I wouldn't argue that having
graphical environments is part of a plot

1338
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:15,460
graphical environments are useful for a
lot of people

1339
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:22,460
I don't like it myself but that doesn't
make it bad

1340
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:32,579
and that's why we have graphical
environments in free software to

1341
01:33:32,579 --> 01:33:37,219
a lot users want that I would I pushed
and pushed and pushed for people to

1342
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:39,030
develop graphical environments

1343
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:42,630
cuz I not I want those users to have
freedom to

1344
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:49,630
not just users with my tastes will be
are sending our message over two periods

1345
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:59,380
DVD re back their way back there's a
reason for the stage

1346
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:02,869
go back to their stance we will be %ah

1347
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:04,820
kicking off with I Europe has hackers
