1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,410
up

2
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:24,710
sack

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,230
who there on the ice like Red Bull

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,230
guys like your

5
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,070
that's the shit alright then again be
gone for the time alright my name

6
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:53,120
you know like this is my first time
speaking open

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,579
what's it's like you know who the hell
are these guys they come from nowhere

8
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,030
you know

9
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,789
first time speakers of stuff I'd like to
get you know I like you to know who I am

10
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,949
for talk to because I'm gonna wanna get
to know you guys

11
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:08,060
figure out you know whether we have a
lot of black hats grey hats whitehead's

12
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,729
you know the general

13
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,920
everything I wanna explain a little bit
say about

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,220
passer Crack in Time a trade-off it is
so taboo

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,580
because a lot and presentations here
hope

16
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,850
a little bit I'd attack network

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,640
matter Carter coupon so if that were
true hacker sense

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,420
I get down to little bit shady area
hacking

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,159
and general arm my name on the screen
Jason I'm in information security

20
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,170
officer

21
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,350
basically what i do is i auto policies
for a lot of hospitals

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,430
banks and law firms in the Chicagoland
area also do

23
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,840
spent a lot of time in research because
research is why

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,659
you know our future is so I like to you
know develop new techniques just

25
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,729
basically become the trust into the
actor just toilet stuff in move on my

26
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:56,030
life I got a bachelor's

27
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,320
and network communications management I
got it from

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,200
IIT in Chicago and I finish a lot of it
in my work at I issue

29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,500
so %ah when I was a password cracking is

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,769
come on you couple that in essence now
repeated for the mic

31
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:14,359
are all the handsome no definitions

32
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:18,920
recovering a password basically in
essence

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,709
the art of deciphering decried the

34
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,799
decrypting information within the realm
of passers because you can have cracking

35
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:27,970
and many assets is

36
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,430
you can crack software and that's that's
the crib to deciphering something in the

37
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,250
software

38
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,250
who knows what I'm memory trade office

39
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:51,680
yeah basically what it is it's a time to
memory comparison basically

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,780
its a comparison to 20 minutes you can
have they do the same thing in horse

41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,930
racing it's wanted to

42
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,729
10 to 20 on space the time there's a
whole bunch different comparisons in

43
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:01,030
there

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,250
the trade-off in essence is an exchange
for one thing

45
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,010
that you want but you're willing to give
up something for that

46
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,828
for instance the Wikipedia definition
exchange one thing for another

47
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:15,859
especially relinquishment one benefit
her vantage for another regarded as more

48
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:16,579
desirable

49
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:21,699
when you combine the two this is why I
want to be talking about when you take

50
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:25,229
time memory and you apply it to pass for
cracking

51
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,109
and said generating every possible UN
said generating of possibilities every

52
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,579
time such as Amber forcing how many eyes
perforce

53
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,620
I alright there are a lot of her forces
out there and

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,079
quite honestly at in my profession I
don't have three hours to run

55
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,540
against the secure password does anybody
have three hours to dissuade

56
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,690
my paper forces right now it's a sort of
a waste the time

57
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,870
and said that you generate all you storm
one time

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,000
and in into memory hard drive something
like that

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,280
and then every time you go to recall
that information

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,810
you can quickly make a quarry to a
database a flat file database something

61
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,380
like that

62
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,530
and instantly get that detracted pass
for from

63
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,199
ask for something like that I'm for my
sights

64
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,889
we I and the five lookup weekend he
crept and the five passes and under Sec

65
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,090
and a7 character password instantly am
in a demo that later

66
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,750
and then I also have a like a multi
cracker which will do our list the

67
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,940
all this the passes and I can do 60
passwords in under a minute

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,490
so on demonstrate that later will
outline what I'm gonna be talking about

69
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,210
little bit history password cracking

70
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,799
ciphering relatively boring stuff nice
gonna salmon that

71
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,569
past and present obviously gonna get
some information from you guys three

72
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:44,409
guys rap

73
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,150
time Eritrea basics explained you
exactly what time the memory as

74
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,229
and the trade of inspired I'm gonna give
you some the storage requirements how

75
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,159
much space

76
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:57,020
love these databases require their they
can be 200px

77
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,919
to 2 terabytes and right now we're
pushing like the one point a terabyte

78
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:01,900
range

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,750
so on this couple techniques how many
have you guys ever heard of rainbow

80
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,599
tables

81
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,409
yeah really popular application but very
weak and statistically

82
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:14,990
inaccurate because the fact above the
map it sees behind it

83
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,840
om there are two types out right now the
type that I've been developing

84
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,680
which is a true haz database on the 21
21 comparison

85
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,340
and then there's rainbow tables which
uses really funky mathematics to get

86
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,490
around

87
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,969
are the massive storage requirements
that we that are required by me and if

88
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:31,580
i'm looking up

89
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,080
and multi I'm gonna beat dem doing
demonstrations both give you a little

90
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,830
history how I gots where I'm at

91
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,400
and then if time for many I'm gonna go
over how we are basically

92
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,849
since the dark the first revisions are
the database was so huge

93
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,729
we ate we could even hold a candle to
rainbow tables so we had to think of

94
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:48,400
something

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,430
to cut the sides is down this huge
password a basis so that we could

96
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,479
compare to ramble tables actually
compete and

97
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,210
password cracking market so we did was
we did a buncha magic with us here seems

98
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,539
to really get over there

99
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,090
saw let's get going alright I basically
brief history

100
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,430
up suffering this effort has been around
for ever and that's just

101
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,710
everybody knows that to use them wars
modern culture and never fails people

102
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,508
have used occur

103
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,610
I encryption for messages telephones
their PCs

104
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,490
and when the PC came around there was
this huge

105
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,009
were originally what they use was user
permissions to protect passwords and

106
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:24,270
stuff

107
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,498
everything was stored in drug regular
plain text and I

108
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:31,039
after a little while you can see the
multi-user environment we can't do that

109
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,919
anymore

110
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,490
now they had to come up with algorithms
to encrypt the password implement a

111
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,620
password file

112
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,599
arm that basically that technique has

113
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:44,080
is been pushed all the way till today
that's that's what we use today

114
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,210
views pass for files loaded with and
corrupted hashers

115
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,389
and noms partner that is the problem so
and basically encryption can be applied

116
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:52,499
to any

117
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:56,639
text communication little history random
guessing which was

118
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
basically walk up to pass a prompt any
type you know

119
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,879
got sex and something else the top 45

120
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,539
use even get educated guessing as we
know something about your

121
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,599
your target your desired target for
instance if I know

122
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,659
my targets has a dog named for an hour
or whatever

123
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:16,740
I'm gonna type taken branagh the biggest
one is the girlfriend people

124
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,770
don't use your your girlfriend
boyfriend's name is a password is so bad

125
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,639
pattern matching is why Tom a lot of the
older up with these to do was

126
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,800
when the Japanese word but say in the
war Japanese women cryptic message

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,539
and they send it across what they do was
grammatical and word

128
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,389
matching to see how many okay this word
is three letters so we know that it's

129
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,490
gotta stay in 31 around then they just

130
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,900
trying pattern match the entire message
together and then

131
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,319
the most common animals from nowhere as
for cracking nowadays

132
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,460
also the longest most tedious thing I've
ever done in my life is perforce Inc

133
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,349
on try every single combination that you
can possibly try

134
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,930
and a set character set and and just see
if one matches and if it doesn't

135
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,189
well you gotta choose a new character
set start all over on

136
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,409
not only is that just thats thats the
most insane thing I've ever heard

137
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:08,669
and that's what drove me to get into
something else and that's why time every

138
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:10,779
trade off is so popular now

139
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:14,870
the other thing was I the classic
dictionary attack its

140
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,900
because the file save having the restart
every time they

141
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,150
out they apply the dictionary attack
which has definitely boosted

142
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,749
effectiveness over 46

143
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,809
I mean for forcing another itself isn't
too bad a thing

144
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:29,330
but it's just too slow for on when
you're trying to

145
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,640
when you definitely have 500 pass for
senator hatch is that neither

146
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,770
perverse you can't for for some of its
just gonna take way too long

147
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,870
here's our basically in the present

148
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,990
the past eight of computing on how many
remember when we had five gig hard

149
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,950
drives

150
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,950
that was the big deal okay well honey
remember the

151
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,860
the old ass rammed pc100 the the pan am
one

152
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,950
all that stuff the the dreaded I sis lot

153
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,670
okay on da 62 Mac OS UNIX you're talking
about all the old school stuff that

154
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,469
lot of the guys that were speaking at
this conference they grew up on that

155
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,220
stuff

156
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:12,220
om so where few things that have changed
since then

157
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,760
processors hard drives all that stuff

158
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,230
hard drives are through the roof Itachi
just released a 750 gigabyte hard drive

159
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,390
and that's like a five hundred dollar
purchase you can you can read his things

160
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,110
together and have a massive array for
relatively cheap

161
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,650
memory CPU's everything's to the roof
right now on we're getting to the point

162
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,590
where

163
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,750
on processors couldn't get any faster so
we're gonna start doing up the course

164
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,100
tripling up the course

165
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,320
put four cores into a process just make
you know things faster now that's gonna

166
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,110
drive software become more

167
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,260
symmetrically or answered so eventually
we're going it's a point where

168
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,470
will be running sixteen to get hurt
CPU's in the software

169
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,840
it will actually take advantage of that
we're not there yet so you know until

170
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,450
then

171
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,270
that's what we gotta deal with on grid
computing sons big angry computing

172
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,350
it's basically a different version of
distributed

173
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,830
on distributed is huge dynamic software
is a software

174
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,920
like on for one for forcing they

175
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,150
what they're doing now sir developing a
little more smarter grid for Ceres

176
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,390
to wear they'll build the genetically
alter what they're guessing

177
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,220
just a Justin to see if they can
statistically hit the target quicker

178
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,870
on we now have as in the words of a

179
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,430
mister stahlman we have in new and can
you close lennox

180
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,640
so at school and then Windows XP and
Vista is just never gonna come out so

181
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,300
you know never mind about that yes thing
for you Windows users

182
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,050
this is what you need to say I'm sorry
missus Tom and please forgive me for

183
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,490
using

184
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,880
tighter software

185
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,130
the Sun Grid is basically dollar an hour

186
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,210
for CPA you can buy 10,000 CP is for one
hour

187
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,290
at ten thousand box and that's a lot of
horsepower but

188
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,599
it's not available to the masses because
I don't have ten thousand dollars

189
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,160
I can't do that so it's just its it's
good for big business but not good for

190
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,069
the little guy

191
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,170
distributed computing is basically

192
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,089
on you can have a hundred and 50s are
weak machines are 100 week machines but

193
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,190
it's heavily dependent on this offer
your software can't isn't distributed

194
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,740
then you can take advantage of that and
there's alotta distribute its offer out

195
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,900
there right now

196
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,540
this is where time every trade off on
camera tradeoff is an old idea

197
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,890
it's not now at all on the preconception
was held back basically by the times in

198
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,050
the age that it was

199
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,210
fought off because you can't do

200
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,740
a huge cache database on a 500 gig ARF

201
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,190
five gig hard drive it's just not going
to work you don't have the

202
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,560
you don't have the available memory to
trade off for

203
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,640
that the time that you want arm

204
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,000
basically what it is store everything
the first time for quick recall it

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,630
that's just the basics that's how it is
usually consumes huge amounts a memory

206
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,410
like I said we're up to 1.8 terabytes on
a single database

207
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,969
and I i mean we can scale all the way up
to 3 45 67

208
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,280
no problem because once you pass at six
character marker

209
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,250
storing all combinations especially
alphanumeric you can and you can just

210
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,310
exponentially increase the size of your
database so

211
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,480
I could have a 200-acre by 136 character

212
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,890
but then the moment I put that seven in
their its gonna go up to

213
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,960
1.2 terabytes that's the type of
exponential increase we get

214
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,310
just to give you an idea gotta know your
key space for instance

215
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,930
you to store all 136 alpha lower which
is a through

216
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,850
houses or whatever you got a raise it
all out that's 231 million

217
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,020
combinations an SEC 127 Europe in the
billions

218
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,220
and then one through eight your 217
billion combinations and that's what

219
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,660
we're working on right now

220
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,550
on I'll be done with this database in
about a month

221
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,280
the storage requirements let me just go
over this is just a little brief

222
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,180
exactly white what goes into you know
what you have to figure out before you

223
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,280
can start thinking about bill and
databases wedding and

224
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,319
is gonna coats and maps and you know by
a couple big hard drives expected

225
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,620
fit attack it happen so in order to
store the text and ask you to figure out

226
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,650
what the tax is going to cost in memory

227
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,569
and what the hash is gonna cost in
memory so if you're looking at it right

228
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,790
now for instance

229
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,380
a6 character passwords gonna cost three
bites and yes

230
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,580
store the convo the the hash next to it
so it's gonna cost in nineteen bites

231
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,060
just the store one-line

232
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,250
or one Password

233
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,950
if you look at it right now this is just
a good example love the increase

234
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,990
in size when you start moving into the
next term's friend since 12 6l followers

235
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,430
only about 5

236
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,630
gigabytes you the 127 awful or is about
hiring 20k

237
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,600
13 Europe and like the 3.5 terror by
range which

238
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,870
you know now a lot of people can get to
here's what a database looks like this

239
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,580
is what

240
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,600
not exactly what ours looks like right
now but this is what the old version

241
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,340
looks like

242
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,370
basically take the tax you store next to
the hash

243
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,810
take the tax to store next to the Haus
take the taxes or next the past these

244
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,520
are the rose in your database

245
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,560
what you do is let's say I have I'm II
wanna search for that ass the OCC

246
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,330
17 women do is make a court to that
database in its gonna match up my ass

247
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,570
that's good return the tax row and
that's basically

248
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:26,370
I'm gonna get a from and that's
basically what it is

249
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,450
our database is storing exactly what I
just showed you store the text next to

250
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,900
ask a system space

251
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,230
I'm going to roll that it consumes tons
space

252
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,280
the good thing about it is our that has
databases have 100 percent accuracy for

253
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,970
their set character set

254
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,190
on if I wanted to has database on

255
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,130
137 alpha I'll have a hundred percent of
those passwords and their

256
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,740
rainbow tables if I build Wrangler
tables for 136 out for

257
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,290
I could be missing statistically 57 a
percent

258
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,270
we're talking billions a passwords thats
that is literally

259
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,290
maybe hundreds of millions of passwords
that are not in the database

260
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:10,290
that is why the fall season to rainbow
tables right now

261
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,730
I mean you've heard a frame for tables
yeah everybody's heard on obviously

262
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,550
here's the question: how many even know
how they work

263
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,920
for example

264
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,970
okay computes a value look set up based
on what's

265
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,900
when it was a computer

266
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,380
yeah it's a basically it with a lot of
people tell me asking

267
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,810
well how to ramble tables where can I
say or they very passwords

268
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,730
as an owner what's the mathematics
behind rainbow tables how does it really

269
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,360
work

270
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,550
and it took me so long to figure out you
know where did this idea come from

271
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,120
rainbow tables it's a it's a really
weird name and what is all this stuff

272
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,310
and now so I did it on a research at

273
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,170
and what is it the it that bill's
authors rainbow chains rain with chains

274
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,100
are basically patterns intervals

275
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,350
I'm if you want me to elaborate this I
live right on this I can you want me to

276
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,200
okay I'm basically what it is they take
random data

277
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,920
locate patterns and remove all the other
data to make intervals

278
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,750
alright there's a string of numbers a
front view need to define an interval

279
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:27,750
in there I give me a few seconds

280
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,320
five digit interval 05 10 15 real simple

281
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,980
there's another one 135 attitudes it
this is a general

282
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,750
reason

283
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,050
they're called Rainbow mathematics is
because it also has to do with intervals

284
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,980
and patterns take that same strain
numbers

285
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,410
apply colors too that's where they get
the name ramble

286
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,120
rainbow tables because now fine and
financial

287
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,610
or find a pattern patterns with the
colors

288
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:07,610
intervals are the numbers give a few
seconds same two intervals

289
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,480
but then you gotta 00:03:16 patter which
is below

290
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,380
and one 714 which meal I tried you see
where the parents come from where the

291
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,280
animals come from

292
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,060
basically this is Randall mathematics
and what they do is they take these

293
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,540
numbers

294
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,688
ravenous circle and then you can

295
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:31,410
there early you can go 0 of you can go
00:16:00 16 0 16 0 16 because they're in

296
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,380
a circular motion

297
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:38,090
and that's where a mathematics basically
came from Universal store in sequence

298
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,490
along with the same day to help recover
there's a little bit of extra bases they

299
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,160
put in their

300
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,480
on for the reversing the ashes and now
for the desired result let's air

301
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,590
my me wanna make a request the Davis its
1259

302
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,669
10 11 to 15 if I have an interval stored
in the database

303
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,380
15 10 to 15 how do you think I determine
the rest at my

304
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,550
desired result yep that's it

305
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,879
perforce the data in between deductible
what they do is they take 15 10 15

306
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,490
and they fill it all up and then I say
they remove numbers

307
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,620
such as for 9 and 14

308
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,680
and I say what that doesn't match let's
put those back

309
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,490
deductive leave remove more and more and
more numbers until we finally get the

310
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:22,760
what

311
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,870
this is why ramble table scan you can
build a huge ramble table with

312
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,370
ninety-nine percent accuracy

313
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,770
and you can make a pass for TWO and I'll
take it like that will do it

314
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,740
or you take another password you gotta
make or two and I'll take 10 minutes

315
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,880
the reason that it doesn't take that
long is because it has a deductive leave

316
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,710
remove all the other numbers to figure
out

317
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,220
what's the exact result here's some
comparisons between

318
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,580
the Haus database is what I do the
rainbow tables as well

319
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,210
the other technique is on are percent
accuracy

320
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,330
with the has stated they say database
and have variable actor see

321
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,199
with the rain with tables on the stores
computations for them ran with tables

322
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,140
are obviously

323
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,920
a lot smaller because they remove all
the unnecessary numbers

324
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,260
and store just patterns but that also
true you also lose time and that's it

325
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,170
saving memory

326
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,120
but you're losing time that's where time
a return of balance comes

327
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,040
on we've developed the technique of
applying some really cool CRC

328
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,590
mathematics to the whole deal

329
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,790
to really figure out you know we really
shrunk them down a lot on the other

330
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,450
thing is

331
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,660
the md5 woke up as this

332
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,910
set search to so if I do Corey it's
going to take me half a second

333
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,660
for a second or you know 34 seconds to
make a quarry

334
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,070
on usually it depends on the size and
database right now running

335
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:45,220
12 1/2 seconds and that that that is
basically a delay in the web

336
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,440
it has nothing to do with the database
if I'm at the if I'm at the did the

337
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,300
database server itself and make a quarry

338
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,520
it's the same result I'm every time if
I'm running rainbow tables

339
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,870
it's gonna take anywhere from three
seconds to 10 minutes to do it that's

340
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,200
that

341
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,679
the variance I was talking about earlier
the essence AT&T on Angeles again all

342
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,760
you're doing is you're giving up memory
for TAC

343
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,870
what's your most valuable asset tak

344
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,470
because thats you only have from that
now

345
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,690
so when in doubt and that's that's thats
Roseville invaluable asset so I'm very

346
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,420
well I'm

347
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,790
to give up 10 terabytes of space for
simply

348
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,330
you know being able to crack password
and under seige on

349
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,090
instead of searching in taxi space it's
time disco hands

350
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,629
just generate all possible a storm for
quick recall later

351
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,700
a couple techniques these are there has
to be his final tables

352
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,220
and then the the database or flat file
Lauren said

353
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,230
this is just basically you can use a
sequel database to store them

354
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,720
you can use a text file put them in
their binary basic

355
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,260
basic stuff not a big deal are

356
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,730
I'm gonna go ahead and demo some stuff
for you guys are

357
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,800
I need gimme five passwords

358
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,300
71 I alpha

359
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:08,770
anybody you just 77 random character so
that it's not biased at all

360
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,210
what just sell for in the seven runs
lower alpha

361
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:18,870
and severance

362
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,720
just alpha yeah boralex

363
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,720
else going to be the replacement

364
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:37,350
alright criminal law okay

365
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:50,110
i coming along

366
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:55,970
there are

367
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,840
basically there's your hashes for the
the

368
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,129
the ones that they gave me what I mean
do is go ahead and

369
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:09,130
give you demo on what in the five lookup
can do let's take the first one

370
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,410
ACS g0 I will hand at the same here

371
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,850
alright ready this is delay on the web
mostly

372
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,830
boom that 26 character password broke

373
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:28,830
let's do the next one put that in there

374
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,180
up look now the six character broke
let's put the seven and then see what

375
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,750
happens

376
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:45,750
group

377
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,850
notice the exact same return time for no
matter what the link this for

378
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:01,850
let me show you the multi interface cuz
it doesn't it sort of get boring doing

379
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,549
one at a time

380
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:13,460
I mean can you imagine going through an
entire list a $500 cash is just

381
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,289
being proactive let's say you're
auditing your webform database

382
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:21,230
just make sure everybody is complying
with the set policy that you set and not

383
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,889
say it's

384
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,049
you have to have seven long and it has
to be alphanumeric or something like

385
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:25,418
that

386
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:30,049
it gets it just gets her tedious going
through that database in auditing all of

387
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:30,389
them

388
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:35,649
so what we'll do is

389
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:42,249
take that now I see more so and we'll do
all those

390
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:47,460
and all I gotta do is take this in here

391
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,549
how long do you think it's going to take
I'm gonna give it about 10 to 15 seconds

392
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:57,720
to break five passes that are completely
basically completely random

393
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,529
so let's give it a run one to

394
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:07,379
3 0 is that scary

395
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:14,379
90

396
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:18,779
I know I do you guys its it the concept
to 10 20 isn't too hard it's

397
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:22,999
trading time for memory there's a lot of
information on the site and the five

398
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,600
lookup and non

399
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,720
a lot of this stuff can be re explained
on their

400
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
I mean its it's very simple about what I
mean that's

401
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,970
that's the penny me a tenor a trade-off
you see I broke five

402
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,070
hases and like three and a half sacks

403
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,918
completely random data and my next
databases

404
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,129
is got a completely different character
set really scary stuff expecially

405
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:50,999
on for people that don't use alt that
everything on the hashes

406
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:54,850
I'm just give you our history we did not
I did not start out there at all

407
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,859
I mean my first song was a 134
alphanumeric special everything pays

408
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:03,189
THP and bicycle it was basically the
slowest most ridiculous thing on the

409
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,629
planet

410
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:07,799
you're better off to spur forcing I went
2-for-4 past because it's so much better

411
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,349
so obviously have to move up in the
scales to moved up to

412
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:15,840
I moved it over to like a 125 still not
so impressive couldn't have a que tan or

413
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,908
a trade off at that point

414
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:21,039
because I still not that I'm impressive
at all army move for 126

415
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,690
we're getting there not a big deal still
on

416
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,220
than week for we decided that databases
were getting to

417
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,320
ungodly huge we need figure out how
we're going to get our

418
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,599
get around it overall I'm so we apply
the CRC

419
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:37,950
technique to it definitely cut it down
probably to about a third of the

420
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,779
original size

421
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,080
and now right now we're at the 127 next
on

422
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,049
you know what give me a 10-digit number

423
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:49,929
alright

424
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:56,929
there let's do this anybody's our phone
numbers surpass work

425
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,090
now

426
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,460
that's pretty good because I think it
should break your

427
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:16,460
0 that cycle that's right there

428
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,659
yes it's down now

429
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:25,039
now yeah

430
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,289
yeah

431
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:31,519
breaking that the next revision a
database so definitely I mean it'll

432
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:31,960
break

433
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,389
anything like is in a break a 01 through

434
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:38,549
10 digit password sup thats that's
definitely

435
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:43,019
people that use it on the next one hour
and use I'll show you the character set

436
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,489
and you tell me if it's intimidating and
not at all arm

437
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:50,309
recently removed from the bill that says
be in PHP which is

438
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:54,428
ungodly slow and I you know I had to
force myself to basically learn C

439
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,779
I relearn it again just so that I can
recovery code everything and build the

440
00:26:57,779 --> 00:26:58,929
database is faster

441
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:03,070
was taking too long here's the next
character set for anyone sir 5abi

442
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:07,349
able to break all 255 characters and the
entire ask the alphabet

443
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:10,809
I'm 6 or 7 I'll be able to brake
anything out from the American

444
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,599
her second the a blank I'll be able
break any eight lengths alpha

445
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,629
lower an entire and all I love all the

446
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:21,139
in my possibilities that we're gonna
move and do anything a

447
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:26,149
basically eight to 10 on numeric so we
can break 00:03:10 America no

448
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:30,009
it's going to be about 1.5 terabytes
everything is basically it's three in 20

449
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:30,980
drives

450
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,049
read it together it's a huge array arm

451
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:37,589
in about two weeks Sobi response we
don't like two weeks ago

452
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,740
we had a couple power failures stuff
like that sorta says fine scheduled it

453
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,450
should be done in about a month

454
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,490
see guys need to check back in about a
month and I'm definitely check out some

455
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,559
the progress we've made so far

456
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,109
on this is just the CRC stuff I could go
to explain it but their stuff on the web

457
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,199
and digital look at

458
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,089
because it's really sort of complex I
don't wanna waste love your time

459
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:04,369
and its its relatively boring stuff but
for you I'll gear heads a lot to get

460
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:05,649
into that sorta stuff

461
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:08,999
definitely hit the web site take a look
at it and now there's lotsa stuff

462
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:10,980
available on md5 lookup cell

463
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,799
to look I'm just a couple guys Alex he
definitely help me out you nosey cox's

464
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,259
guys were testing for me

465
00:28:17,259 --> 00:28:20,659
no elected times towards our
calculations for me

466
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:23,950
and so he definitely help me out my
early times

467
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,109
so I like to give them a credit

468
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:34,109
and that's basically a any questions

469
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,799
the question was where we get a copy for
database well since I'm a very good fan

470
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,700
of free

471
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,450
slashed open source software the bill
details are available online just like

472
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,720
Ranbir table stuff

473
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,820
you can download the app singles our own
tables if you want no promises in a lot

474
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,529
of space for

475
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:53,799
which is which is not too bad arm that's
definitely they'll go on the website

476
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,408
you can download the app's I'm not gonna
sell the tables I'm not gonna do

477
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:58,509
anything like that

478
00:28:58,509 --> 00:29:05,509
I'm not a big fan of thats have think so

479
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,879
you're seeing I don't think this Mike
works this is weird all right let's get

480
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:11,789
it does now

481
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:15,609
are um a you're saying that the the the

482
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:18,859
the space necessary for your technique
is is approaching

483
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:23,428
a rainbow tables but I remember seeing a
20 gig Realty with that will handle

484
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,549
lower case uppercase numeric and

485
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:29,658
let's let's have a factor see that's on
99.9 I believe

486
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:33,539
for up to some characters its it's
basically if it's twenty gates that's

487
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,908
not realistically possible cuz I've done
it on a research network with an some

488
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:37,749
self self

489
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:40,970
now its in ninety close it may be like a
137

490
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,029
yeah yet it may be a different algorithm
to

491
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:48,849
okay right yeah it's an alum out for
them your you're basically rainbow

492
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:49,499
tables

493
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:52,799
ellen is the smallest algorithm you only
have to break up to seven characters

494
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,529
that's why it's if it was alan

495
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:59,059
that's why would be so small nice if at
the same ramble tables were made in sha1

496
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,668
units gonna be huge compared to and
thats that's where comparison to

497
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:06,489
we're doing md5 sum compared to the fact
this is so so for the characters that

498
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:07,669
you're doing

499
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:11,349
well would be um you know something
that's like 99.9

500
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:14,908
for a multiple what's a size arm I think

501
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:18,749
if you got a plain text debt I think
it's plain to ask text that info they

502
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:19,489
have

503
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:23,580
the comparison table us insight 1.3 over
around 1.5

504
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,949
as is or for a cross for free plus for
the center

505
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,989
I there so I definitely a buying a bunch
of hard drives is one option but have

506
00:30:32,989 --> 00:30:34,039
you considered

507
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:37,730
I'm using distributed hash tables or
redundant to shoot it has tables on the

508
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,980
internets yet to offload

509
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,919
some the status to other people most
definitely the problem with that is

510
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:47,200
weekend we can split up the tables but
you what you do is expressly when you're

511
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,599
in a production environment like in the
50 compares

512
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,950
I mean if you look at it right now this
one's been online since July 1

513
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,759
it's already had a hundred eighty
thousand for is to it and the cats 5000

514
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:57,739
a

515
00:30:57,739 --> 00:31:01,299
by split it up I'm gonna definitely put
a damper on my reliability

516
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:05,859
but and in the home grown environment
most definitely if you got 50 boxes with

517
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:09,179
party hard drives and I'm from all
together and distribute the whole thing

518
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:11,720
just got a bill in interface for

519
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,970
so yeah so that's that's the key thing
is I'm going for redundancy I mean

520
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,599
if you look at this like I went for
reliability that's why I put everything

521
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,070
in one big pile

522
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,200
if you wanna spread all the tables out
that's up to you Apple thanks

523
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,500
yeah

524
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,579
100 com know your your call your work
you're looking for using md5

525
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:33,579
as the hatch-waxman to season defy

526
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:37,309
to misses the cool thing about the new
technique with CRC's

527
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:40,418
and this is why this is why the reason
went that way

528
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:44,230
not only because we take the first few
bites at the Haus

529
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,730
and all houses are hacks and we build
the CRC of that

530
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,079
it'll do any algorithm you just have to
tweak the tools to do it

531
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:55,168
so I can do Elan sha1 SAT 256

532
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:59,009
and then the cool thing is is regardless
so the hash lang so you're moving up to

533
00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:00,149
the SSA

534
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:03,759
one or whatever it's a forty bit bypass
arm

535
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,700
it's still going to produce the exact
same size in a database for goes to the

536
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,869
algorithm that's the other competing
thing we have with rainbow tables is

537
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:11,490
that

538
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,240
meanwhile tables as a question the first
question was the tables for

539
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,720
now and this essence the tables turn out
they're all the same because at CRC

540
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,240
technique that supply tell

541
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,389
I could have look at people's available
for other half is this I seventy-five

542
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:28,069
on that's basically because I funded
this entire project myself

543
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:31,349
that's the only reason I haven't moved
and other algorithms because

544
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:35,189
Avion initial investments myself so yeah
it's definitely

545
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,649
if I had the money I would have every
hour at the Moncloa and I definitely

546
00:32:38,649 --> 00:32:44,200
have picked a worse for

547
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,589
how long as a random guess how long do
you think you'll be in till

548
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:51,009
salt passwords come to the same this

549
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:55,950
arm as of right now I'm thinking like
because I've heard I've heard stories /a

550
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,039
you know 5 five years ago people built

551
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,720
huge table Zavala assaulted versions
with all the salt with all the

552
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,639
combinations

553
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:07,369
on depending on the size and saw

554
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:10,480
fits a to buy salt or whatever

555
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,269
its gonna cause it's going to cause you
to duplicate your table like maybe six

556
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:15,179
eight times

557
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:19,179
what the regular sizes if it was
insulted you've got a six but had

558
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:22,819
six by itself its gonna X like it's
gonna be huge the tables can be

559
00:33:22,819 --> 00:33:24,359
unbearably back so

560
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:28,029
its it's definitely an gonna come around
eventually but not right now it's just

561
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:29,499
not possible just like

562
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:32,980
teams here was impossible fifteen years
ago so this

563
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,470
witty crack just 32 alphanumeric

564
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,569
yeah yes basically yeah just

565
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:44,029
its technologies is holding us back
that's the only thing right now

566
00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:47,309
how long do you plan on keeping the
service open how do you plan on doing

567
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:49,678
the possible legal issues

568
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,869
arm realistically legality issues stop
live because

569
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:57,149
I'm using it as a proactive security
tool have any have you ever used

570
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:01,179
of crack alright one of the most popular

571
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:04,409
password crackers on the planet used in
every single

572
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:09,720
place I have ever been to this is no
different except for its Web oriented

573
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,190
there are no legal issues what people do
with it

574
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,779
is up to them and unless they're gonna
go after Symantec

575
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:20,259
the neck you know they can come after me

576
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:23,730
I'm sorry walked in a little bit late
see me already answered this point is

577
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,029
there any kind a priority

578
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:28,770
on your table set up in the database
because it seems to me like

579
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,940
someone using a password most people
generally

580
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,418
use a password night zzzzz do you have
that towards the end

581
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:39,868
to kinda make your query a little bit
faster makes sense

582
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:43,220
its what it is it's based off a vast so
with

583
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,440
and and then it see our seat and put
into the database its

584
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,129
its its index so it doesn't matter
because what it does is the

585
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,418
the index is put in a memory and they
researched like that

586
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:57,069
so the as far storing them in priority

587
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:00,380
I mean it would make a difference make a
difference now it's gonna be the same

588
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:07,380
every time

589
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:12,069
them when you're using this CRC
technique to reduce the space it takes

590
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,788
up

591
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:16,390
if you take me know very if you see a
very Lord

592
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,680
long ash and CRC it down

593
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,739
a smaller space couldn't that create

594
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:26,380
a problem I love conflicts if you
actually

595
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,809
yes attach the reason we produce a lot
over space the question is

596
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:33,479
question is when you see it when you
take a long ass and UCR see it what

597
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,269
you're doing is you're creating a
smaller hash

598
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:39,109
wait a sec what if two different ashes
Eagle the same thing this is the beauty

599
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:41,069
other because now I don't have to make
another row

600
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:44,829
I just sears is next to each other and
into a little bit of deductive reasoning

601
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:45,890
just like the tables

602
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:50,529
except I can do it I do it a lot faster
than I am tables can so that's it's

603
00:35:50,529 --> 00:35:51,719
almost similar method

604
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:55,380
but what you doing is it your reversing
it you're gonna

605
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,900
let's say I have fffff is my CRC office

606
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,949
a 32-bit hash but then ten different
things

607
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:05,249
match that same ffff CRC value wanna

608
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:08,519
what happens as those are all grouped
into the same row and in the text

609
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,069
database

610
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:12,089
and their set so its for

611
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:15,538
for long as the CRC for the tax than the
reverse

612
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,579
so in the actually save space because
you can group although some were once

613
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:23,179
and still be able to reverse them no
problem by then you're not creating a

614
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:25,910
row for each different value some sack

615
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,569
yes was kind of like a change fast arm

616
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:33,099
its its its and now it's not even

617
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,109
it's not even close to that that same
mentality that the code

618
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:39,339
definitely is a lot different in the way
that it's done its

619
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:45,400
its relatively complex cell okay thanks

620
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,769
and ass

621
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:55,769
and if anyone has any questions they can
come talk to me and then my email is

622
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,670
actually on the indy five lookup sites
I'll

623
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,880
thank you
